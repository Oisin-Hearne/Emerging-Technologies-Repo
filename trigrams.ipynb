SAVILLE ENGLAND.ST. PETERSBURGH DEC. TH .YOU WILL REJOICE TO HEAR THAT NO DISASTER HAS ACCOMPANIED THECOMMENCEMENT OF AN ENTERPRISE WHICH YOU HAVE REGARDED WITH SUCH EVILFOREBODINGS. I ARRIVED HERE YESTERDAY AND MY FIRST TASK IS TO ASSUREMY DEAR SISTER OF MY WELFARE AND INCREASING CONFIDENCE IN THE SUCCESSOF MY UNDERTAKING.I AM ALREADY FAR NORTH OF LONDON AND AS I WALK IN THE STREETS OFPETERSBURGH I FEEL A COLD NORTHERN BREEZE PLAY UPON MY CHEEKS WHICHBRACES MY NERVES AND FILLS ME WITH DELIGHT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THISFEELING THIS BREEZE WHICH HAS TRAVELLED FROM THE REGIONS TOWARDSWHICH I AM ADVANCING GIVES ME A FORETASTE OF THOSE ICY CLIMES.INSPIRITED BY THIS WIND OF PROMISE MY DAYDREAMS BECOME MORE FERVENTAND VIVID. I TRY IN VAIN TO BE PERSUADED THAT THE POLE IS THE SEAT OFFROST AND DESOLATION IT EVER PRESENTS ITSELF TO MY IMAGINATION AS THEREGION OF BEAUTY AND DELIGHT. THERE MARGARET THE SUN IS FOR EVERVISIBLE ITS BROAD DISK JUST SKIRTING THE HORIZON AND DIFFUSING APERPETUAL SPLENDOUR. THEREFOR WITH YOUR LEAVE MY SISTER I WILL PUTSOME TRUST IN PRECEDING NAVIGATORSTHERE SNOW AND FROST ARE BANISHEDAND SAILING OVER A CALM SEA WE MAY BE WAFTED TO A LAND SURPASSING INWONDERS AND IN BEAUTY EVERY REGION HITHERTO DISCOVERED ON THE HABITABLEGLOBE. ITS PRODUCTIONS AND FEATURES MAY BE WITHOUT EXAMPLE AS THEPHENOMENA OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES UNDOUBTEDLY ARE IN THOSE UNDISCOVEREDSOLITUDES. WHAT MAY NOT BE EXPECTED IN A COUNTRY OF ETERNAL LIGHT IMAY THERE DISCOVER THE WONDROUS POWER WHICH ATTRACTS THE NEEDLE AND MAYREGULATE A THOUSAND CELESTIAL OBSERVATIONS THAT REQUIRE ONLY THISVOYAGE TO RENDER THEIR SEEMING ECCENTRICITIES CONSISTENT FOR EVER. ISHALL SATIATE MY ARDENT CURIOSITY WITH THE SIGHT OF A PART OF THE WORLDNEVER BEFORE VISITED AND MAY TREAD A LAND NEVER BEFORE IMPRINTED BYTHE FOOT OF MAN. THESE ARE MY ENTICEMENTS AND THEY ARE SUFFICIENT TOCONQUER ALL FEAR OF DANGER OR DEATH AND TO INDUCE ME TO COMMENCE THISLABORIOUS VOYAGE WITH THE JOY A CHILD FEELS WHEN HE EMBARKS IN A LITTLEBOAT WITH HIS HOLIDAY MATES ON AN EXPEDITION OF DISCOVERY UP HISNATIVE RIVER. BUT SUPPOSING ALL THESE CONJECTURES TO BE FALSE YOUCANNOT CONTEST THE INESTIMABLE BENEFIT WHICH I SHALL CONFER ON ALLMANKIND TO THE LAST GENERATION BY DISCOVERING A PASSAGE NEAR THE POLETO THOSE COUNTRIES TO REACH WHICH AT PRESENT SO MANY MONTHS AREREQUISITE OR BY ASCERTAINING THE SECRET OF THE MAGNET WHICH IF ATALL POSSIBLE CAN ONLY BE EFFECTED BY AN UNDERTAKING SUCH AS MINE.THESE REFLECTIONS HAVE DISPELLED THE AGITATION WITH WHICH I BEGAN MYLETTER AND I FEEL MY HEART GLOW WITH AN ENTHUSIASM WHICH ELEVATES METO HEAVEN FOR NOTHING CONTRIBUTES SO MUCH TO TRANQUILLISE THE MIND ASA STEADY PURPOSEA POINT ON WHICH THE SOUL MAY FIX ITS INTELLECTUALEYE. THIS EXPEDITION HAS BEEN THE FAVOURITE DREAM OF MY EARLY YEARS. IHAVE READ WITH ARDOUR THE ACCOUNTS OF THE VARIOUS VOYAGES WHICH HAVEBEEN MADE IN THE PROSPECT OF ARRIVING AT THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEANTHROUGH THE SEAS WHICH SURROUND THE POLE. YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT AHISTORY OF ALL THE VOYAGES MADE FOR PURPOSES OF DISCOVERY COMPOSED THEWHOLE OF OUR GOOD UNCLE THOMAS LIBRARY. MY EDUCATION WAS NEGLECTEDYET I WAS PASSIONATELY FOND OF READING. THESE VOLUMES WERE MY STUDYDAY AND NIGHT AND MY FAMILIARITY WITH THEM INCREASED THAT REGRET WHICHI HAD FELT AS A CHILD ON LEARNING THAT MY FATHERS DYING INJUNCTIONHAD FORBIDDEN MY UNCLE TO ALLOW ME TO EMBARK IN A SEAFARING LIFE.THESE VISIONS FADED WHEN I PERUSED FOR THE FIRST TIME THOSE POETSWHOSE EFFUSIONS ENTRANCED MY SOUL AND LIFTED IT TO HEAVEN. I ALSOBECAME A POET AND FOR ONE YEAR LIVED IN A PARADISE OF MY OWN CREATIONI IMAGINED THAT I ALSO MIGHT OBTAIN A NICHE IN THE TEMPLE WHERE THENAMES OF HOMER AND SHAKESPEARE ARE CONSECRATED. YOU ARE WELLACQUAINTED WITH MY FAILURE AND HOW HEAVILY I BORE THE DISAPPOINTMENT.BUT JUST AT THAT TIME I INHERITED THE FORTUNE OF MY COUSIN AND MYTHOUGHTS WERE TURNED INTO THE CHANNEL OF THEIR EARLIER BENT.SIX YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE I RESOLVED ON MY PRESENT UNDERTAKING. ICAN EVEN NOW REMEMBER THE HOUR FROM WHICH I DEDICATED MYSELF TO THISGREAT ENTERPRISE. I COMMENCED BY INURING MY BODY TO HARDSHIP. IACCOMPANIED THE WHALEFISHERS ON SEVERAL EXPEDITIONS TO THE NORTH SEAI VOLUNTARILY ENDURED COLD FAMINE THIRST AND WANT OF SLEEP I OFTENWORKED HARDER THAN THE COMMON SAILORS DURING THE DAY AND DEVOTED MYNIGHTS TO THE STUDY OF MATHEMATICS THE THEORY OF MEDICINE AND THOSEBRANCHES OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE FROM WHICH A NAVAL ADVENTURER MIGHT DERIVETHE GREATEST PRACTICAL ADVANTAGE. TWICE I ACTUALLY HIRED MYSELF AS ANUNDERMATE IN A GREENLAND WHALER AND ACQUITTED MYSELF TO ADMIRATION. IMUST OWN I FELT A LITTLE PROUD WHEN MY CAPTAIN OFFERED ME THE SECONDDIGNITY IN THE VESSEL AND ENTREATED ME TO REMAIN WITH THE GREATESTEARNESTNESS SO VALUABLE DID HE CONSIDER MY SERVICES.AND NOW DEAR MARGARET DO I NOT DESERVE TO ACCOMPLISH SOME GREAT PURPOSEMY LIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PASSED IN EASE AND LUXURY BUT I PREFERRED GLORY TOEVERY ENTICEMENT THAT WEALTH PLACED IN MY PATH. OH THAT SOME ENCOURAGINGVOICE WOULD ANSWER IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY COURAGE AND MY RESOLUTION ISFIRM BUT MY HOPES FLUCTUATE AND MY SPIRITS ARE OFTEN DEPRESSED. I AMABOUT TO PROCEED ON A LONG AND DIFFICULT VOYAGE THE EMERGENCIES OF WHICHWILL DEMAND ALL MY FORTITUDE I AM REQUIRED NOT ONLY TO RAISE THE SPIRITSOF OTHERS BUT SOMETIMES TO SUSTAIN MY OWN WHEN THEIRS ARE FAILING.THIS IS THE MOST FAVOURABLE PERIOD FOR TRAVELLING IN RUSSIA. THEY FLYQUICKLY OVER THE SNOW IN THEIR SLEDGES THE MOTION IS PLEASANT AND INMY OPINION FAR MORE AGREEABLE THAN THAT OF AN ENGLISH STAGECOACH. THECOLD IS NOT EXCESSIVE IF YOU ARE WRAPPED IN FURSA DRESS WHICH I HAVEALREADY ADOPTED FOR THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WALKING THEDECK AND REMAINING SEATED MOTIONLESS FOR HOURS WHEN NO EXERCISEPREVENTS THE BLOOD FROM ACTUALLY FREEZING IN YOUR VEINS. I HAVE NOAMBITION TO LOSE MY LIFE ON THE POSTROAD BETWEEN ST. PETERSBURGH ANDARCHANGEL.I SHALL DEPART FOR THE LATTER TOWN IN A FORTNIGHT OR THREE WEEKS AND MYINTENTION IS TO HIRE A SHIP THERE WHICH CAN EASILY BE DONE BY PAYING THEINSURANCE FOR THE OWNER AND TO ENGAGE AS MANY SAILORS AS I THINK NECESSARYAMONG THOSE WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO THE WHALEFISHING. I DO NOT INTEND TOSAIL UNTIL THE MONTH OF JUNE AND WHEN SHALL I RETURN AH DEAR SISTER HOWCAN I ANSWER THIS QUESTION IF I SUCCEED MANY MANY MONTHS PERHAPS YEARSWILL PASS BEFORE YOU AND I MAY MEET. IF I FAIL YOU WILL SEE ME AGAIN SOONOR NEVER.FAREWELL MY DEAR EXCELLENT MARGARET. HEAVEN SHOWER DOWN BLESSINGS ON YOUAND SAVE ME THAT I MAY AGAIN AND AGAIN TESTIFY MY GRATITUDE FOR ALL YOURLOVE AND KINDNESS.YOUR AFFECTIONATE BROTHERR. WALTONLETTER TO MRS. SAVILLE ENGLAND.ARCHANGEL TH MARCH .HOW SLOWLY THE TIME PASSES HERE ENCOMPASSED AS I AM BY FROST AND SNOWYET A SECOND STEP IS TAKEN TOWARDS MY ENTERPRISE. I HAVE HIRED AVESSEL AND AM OCCUPIED IN COLLECTING MY SAILORS THOSE WHOM I HAVEALREADY ENGAGED APPEAR TO BE MEN ON WHOM I CAN DEPEND AND ARE CERTAINLYPOSSESSED OF DAUNTLESS COURAGE.BUT I HAVE ONE WANT WHICH I HAVE NEVER YET BEEN ABLE TO SATISFY AND THEABSENCE OF THE OBJECT OF WHICH I NOW FEEL AS A MOST SEVERE EVIL I HAVE NOFRIEND MARGARET WHEN I AM GLOWING WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF SUCCESS THEREWILL BE NONE TO PARTICIPATE MY JOY IF I AM ASSAILED BY DISAPPOINTMENT NOONE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO SUSTAIN ME IN DEJECTION. I SHALL COMMIT MY THOUGHTSTO PAPER IT IS TRUE BUT THAT IS A POOR MEDIUM FOR THE COMMUNICATION OFFEELING. I DESIRE THE COMPANY OF A MAN WHO COULD SYMPATHISE WITH ME WHOSEEYES WOULD REPLY TO MINE. YOU MAY DEEM ME ROMANTIC MY DEAR SISTER BUT IBITTERLY FEEL THE WANT OF A FRIEND. I HAVE NO ONE NEAR ME GENTLE YETCOURAGEOUS POSSESSED OF A CULTIVATED AS WELL AS OF A CAPACIOUS MIND WHOSETASTES ARE LIKE MY OWN TO APPROVE OR AMEND MY PLANS. HOW WOULD SUCH AFRIEND REPAIR THE FAULTS OF YOUR POOR BROTHER I AM TOO ARDENT IN EXECUTIONAND TOO IMPATIENT OF DIFFICULTIES. BUT IT IS A STILL GREATER EVIL TO METHAT I AM SELFEDUCATED FOR THE FIRST FOURTEEN YEARS OF MY LIFE I RAN WILDON A COMMON AND READ NOTHING BUT OUR UNCLE THOMAS BOOKS OF VOYAGES.AT THAT AGE I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH THE CELEBRATED POETS OF OUR OWNCOUNTRY BUT IT WAS ONLY WHEN IT HAD CEASED TO BE IN MY POWER TO DERIVE ITSMOST IMPORTANT BENEFITS FROM SUCH A CONVICTION THAT I PERCEIVED THENECESSITY OF BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH MORE LANGUAGES THAN THAT OF MY NATIVECOUNTRY. NOW I AM TWENTYEIGHT AND AM IN REALITY MORE ILLITERATE THAN MANYSCHOOLBOYS OF FIFTEEN. IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE THOUGHT MORE AND THAT MYDAYDREAMS ARE MORE EXTENDED AND MAGNIFICENT BUT THEY WANT AS THE PAINTERSCALL IT KEEPING AND I GREATLY NEED A FRIEND WHO WOULD HAVE SENSEENOUGH NOT TO DESPISE ME AS ROMANTIC AND AFFECTION ENOUGH FOR ME TOENDEAVOUR TO REGULATE MY MIND.WELL THESE ARE USELESS COMPLAINTS I SHALL CERTAINLY FIND NO FRIEND ON THEWIDE OCEAN NOR EVEN HERE IN ARCHANGEL AMONG MERCHANTS AND SEAMEN. YETSOME FEELINGS UNALLIED TO THE DROSS OF HUMAN NATURE BEAT EVEN IN THESERUGGED BOSOMS. MY LIEUTENANT FOR INSTANCE IS A MAN OF WONDERFUL COURAGEAND ENTERPRISE HE IS MADLY DESIROUS OF GLORY OR RATHER TO WORD MY PHRASEMORE CHARACTERISTICALLY OF ADVANCEMENT IN HIS PROFESSION. HE IS ANENGLISHMAN AND IN THE MIDST OF NATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL PREJUDICESUNSOFTENED BY CULTIVATION RETAINS SOME OF THE NOBLEST ENDOWMENTS OFHUMANITY. I FIRST BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH HIM ON BOARD A WHALE VESSELFINDING THAT HE WAS UNEMPLOYED IN THIS CITY I EASILY ENGAGED HIM TO ASSISTIN MY ENTERPRISE.THE MASTER IS A PERSON OF AN EXCELLENT DISPOSITION AND IS REMARKABLE IN THESHIP FOR HIS GENTLENESS AND THE MILDNESS OF HIS DISCIPLINE. THISCIRCUMSTANCE ADDED TO HIS WELLKNOWN INTEGRITY AND DAUNTLESS COURAGE MADEME VERY DESIROUS TO ENGAGE HIM. A YOUTH PASSED IN SOLITUDE MY BEST YEARSSPENT UNDER YOUR GENTLE AND FEMININE FOSTERAGE HAS SO REFINED THEGROUNDWORK OF MY CHARACTER THAT I CANNOT OVERCOME AN INTENSE DISTASTE TOTHE USUAL BRUTALITY EXERCISED ON BOARD SHIP I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED IT TO BENECESSARY AND WHEN I HEARD OF A MARINER EQUALLY NOTED FOR HIS KINDLINESSOF HEART AND THE RESPECT AND OBEDIENCE PAID TO HIM BY HIS CREW I FELTMYSELF PECULIARLY FORTUNATE IN BEING ABLE TO SECURE HIS SERVICES. I HEARDOF HIM FIRST IN RATHER A ROMANTIC MANNER FROM A LADY WHO OWES TO HIM THEHAPPINESS OF HER LIFE. THIS BRIEFLY IS HIS STORY. SOME YEARS AGO HE LOVEDA YOUNG RUSSIAN LADY OF MODERATE FORTUNE AND HAVING AMASSED A CONSIDERABLESUM IN PRIZEMONEY THE FATHER OF THE GIRL CONSENTED TO THE MATCH. HE SAWHIS MISTRESS ONCE BEFORE THE DESTINED CEREMONY BUT SHE WAS BATHED INTEARS AND THROWING HERSELF AT HIS FEET ENTREATED HIM TO SPARE HERCONFESSING AT THE SAME TIME THAT SHE LOVED ANOTHER BUT THAT HE WAS POORAND THAT HER FATHER WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO THE UNION. MY GENEROUS FRIENDREASSURED THE SUPPLIANT AND ON BEING INFORMED OF THE NAME OF HER LOVERINSTANTLY ABANDONED HIS PURSUIT. HE HAD ALREADY BOUGHT A FARM WITH HISMONEY ON WHICH HE HAD DESIGNED TO PASS THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE BUT HEBESTOWED THE WHOLE ON HIS RIVAL TOGETHER WITH THE REMAINS OF HISPRIZEMONEY TO PURCHASE STOCK AND THEN HIMSELF SOLICITED THE YOUNGWOMANS FATHER TO CONSENT TO HER MARRIAGE WITH HER LOVER. BUT THE OLDMAN DECIDEDLY REFUSED THINKING HIMSELF BOUND IN HONOUR TO MY FRIEND WHOWHEN HE FOUND THE FATHER INEXORABLE QUITTED HIS COUNTRY NOR RETURNEDUNTIL HE HEARD THAT HIS FORMER MISTRESS WAS MARRIED ACCORDING TO HERINCLINATIONS. WHAT A NOBLE FELLOW YOU WILL EXCLAIM. HE ISSO BUT THEN HE IS WHOLLY UNEDUCATED HE IS AS SILENT AS A TURK AND A KINDOF IGNORANT CARELESSNESS ATTENDS HIM WHICH WHILE IT RENDERS HIS CONDUCTTHE MORE ASTONISHING DETRACTS FROM THE INTEREST AND SYMPATHY WHICHOTHERWISE HE WOULD COMMAND.YET DO NOT SUPPOSE BECAUSE I COMPLAIN A LITTLE OR BECAUSE I CANCONCEIVE A CONSOLATION FOR MY TOILS WHICH I MAY NEVER KNOW THAT I AMWAVERING IN MY RESOLUTIONS. THOSE ARE AS FIXED AS FATE AND MY VOYAGEIS ONLY NOW DELAYED UNTIL THE WEATHER SHALL PERMIT MY EMBARKATION. THEWINTER HAS BEEN DREADFULLY SEVERE BUT THE SPRING PROMISES WELL AND ITIS CONSIDERED AS A REMARKABLY EARLY SEASON SO THAT PERHAPS I MAY SAILSOONER THAN I EXPECTED. I SHALL DO NOTHING RASHLY YOU KNOW MESUFFICIENTLY TO CONFIDE IN MY PRUDENCE AND CONSIDERATENESS WHENEVER THESAFETY OF OTHERS IS COMMITTED TO MY CARE.I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU MY SENSATIONS ON THE NEAR PROSPECT OF MYUNDERTAKING. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COMMUNICATE TO YOU A CONCEPTION OFTHE TREMBLING SENSATION HALF PLEASURABLE AND HALF FEARFUL WITH WHICHI AM PREPARING TO DEPART. I AM GOING TO UNEXPLORED REGIONS TO THELAND OF MIST AND SNOW BUT I SHALL KILL NO ALBATROSS THEREFORE DO NOTBE ALARMED FOR MY SAFETY OR IF I SHOULD COME BACK TO YOU AS WORN ANDWOEFUL AS THE ANCIENT MARINER. YOU WILL SMILE AT MY ALLUSION BUT IWILL DISCLOSE A SECRET. I HAVE OFTEN ATTRIBUTED MY ATTACHMENT TO MYPASSIONATE ENTHUSIASM FOR THE DANGEROUS MYSTERIES OF OCEAN TO THATPRODUCTION OF THE MOST IMAGINATIVE OF MODERN POETS. THERE IS SOMETHINGAT WORK IN MY SOUL WHICH I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. I AM PRACTICALLYINDUSTRIOUSPAINSTAKING A WORKMAN TO EXECUTE WITH PERSEVERANCE ANDLABOURBUT BESIDES THIS THERE IS A LOVE FOR THE MARVELLOUS A BELIEFIN THE MARVELLOUS INTERTWINED IN ALL MY PROJECTS WHICH HURRIES ME OUTOF THE COMMON PATHWAYS OF MEN EVEN TO THE WILD SEA AND UNVISITEDREGIONS I AM ABOUT TO EXPLORE.BUT TO RETURN TO DEARER CONSIDERATIONS. SHALL I MEET YOU AGAIN AFTERHAVING TRAVERSED IMMENSE SEAS AND RETURNED BY THE MOST SOUTHERN CAPE OFAFRICA OR AMERICA I DARE NOT EXPECT SUCH SUCCESS YET I CANNOT BEAR TOLOOK ON THE REVERSE OF THE PICTURE. CONTINUE FOR THE PRESENT TO WRITE TOME BY EVERY OPPORTUNITY I MAY RECEIVE YOUR LETTERS ON SOME OCCASIONS WHENI NEED THEM MOST TO SUPPORT MY SPIRITS. I LOVE YOU VERY TENDERLY. REMEMBER ME WITH AFFECTION SHOULD YOU NEVER HEAR FROM ME AGAIN.YOUR AFFECTIONATE BROTHER ROBERT WALTONLETTER TO MRS. SAVILLE ENGLAND.JULY TH .MY DEAR SISTERI WRITE A FEW LINES IN HASTE TO SAY THAT I AM SAFEAND WELL ADVANCEDON MY VOYAGE. THIS LETTER WILL REACH ENGLAND BY A MERCHANTMAN NOW ONITS HOMEWARD VOYAGE FROM ARCHANGEL MORE FORTUNATE THAN I WHO MAY NOTSEE MY NATIVE LAND PERHAPS FOR MANY YEARS. I AM HOWEVER IN GOODSPIRITS MY MEN ARE BOLD AND APPARENTLY FIRM OF PURPOSE NOR DO THEFLOATING SHEETS OF ICE THAT CONTINUALLY PASS US INDICATING THE DANGERSOF THE REGION TOWARDS WHICH WE ARE ADVANCING APPEAR TO DISMAY THEM. WEHAVE ALREADY REACHED A VERY HIGH LATITUDE BUT IT IS THE HEIGHT OFSUMMER AND ALTHOUGH NOT SO WARM AS IN ENGLAND THE SOUTHERN GALESWHICH BLOW US SPEEDILY TOWARDS THOSE SHORES WHICH I SO ARDENTLY DESIRETO ATTAIN BREATHE A DEGREE OF RENOVATING WARMTH WHICH I HAD NOTEXPECTED.NO INCIDENTS HAVE HITHERTO BEFALLEN US THAT WOULD MAKE A FIGURE IN ALETTER. ONE OR TWO STIFF GALES AND THE SPRINGING OF A LEAK AREACCIDENTS WHICH EXPERIENCED NAVIGATORS SCARCELY REMEMBER TO RECORD ANDI SHALL BE WELL CONTENT IF NOTHING WORSE HAPPEN TO US DURING OUR VOYAGE.ADIEU MY DEAR MARGARET. BE ASSURED THAT FOR MY OWN SAKE AS WELL ASYOURS I WILL NOT RASHLY ENCOUNTER DANGER. I WILL BE COOLPERSEVERING AND PRUDENT.BUT SUCCESS SHALL CROWN MY ENDEAVOURS. WHEREFORE NOT THUS FAR IHAVE GONE TRACING A SECURE WAY OVER THE PATHLESS SEAS THE VERY STARSTHEMSELVES BEING WITNESSES AND TESTIMONIES OF MY TRIUMPH. WHY NOTSTILL PROCEED OVER THE UNTAMED YET OBEDIENT ELEMENT WHAT CAN STOP THEDETERMINED HEART AND RESOLVED WILL OF MANMY SWELLING HEART INVOLUNTARILY POURS ITSELF OUT THUS. BUT I MUSTFINISH. HEAVEN BLESS MY BELOVED SISTERR.W.LETTER TO MRS. SAVILLE ENGLAND.AUGUST TH .SO STRANGE AN ACCIDENT HAS HAPPENED TO US THAT I CANNOT FORBEARRECORDING IT ALTHOUGH IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT YOU WILL SEE ME BEFORETHESE PAPERS CAN COME INTO YOUR POSSESSION.LAST MONDAY JULY ST WE WERE NEARLY SURROUNDED BY ICE WHICH CLOSEDIN THE SHIP ON ALL SIDES SCARCELY LEAVING HER THE SEAROOM IN WHICHSHE FLOATED. OUR SITUATION WAS SOMEWHAT DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY AS WEWERE COMPASSED ROUND BY A VERY THICK FOG. WE ACCORDINGLY LAY TOHOPING THAT SOME CHANGE WOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND WEATHER.ABOUT TWO OCLOCK THE MIST CLEARED AWAY AND WE BEHELD STRETCHED OUTIN EVERY DIRECTION VAST AND IRREGULAR PLAINS OF ICE WHICH SEEMED TOHAVE NO END. SOME OF MY COMRADES GROANED AND MY OWN MIND BEGAN TOGROW WATCHFUL WITH ANXIOUS THOUGHTS WHEN A STRANGE SIGHT SUDDENLYATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION AND DIVERTED OUR SOLICITUDE FROM OUR OWNSITUATION. WE PERCEIVED A LOW CARRIAGE FIXED ON A SLEDGE AND DRAWN BYDOGS PASS ON TOWARDS THE NORTH AT THE DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE ABEING WHICH HAD THE SHAPE OF A MAN BUT APPARENTLY OF GIGANTIC STATURESAT IN THE SLEDGE AND GUIDED THE DOGS. WE WATCHED THE RAPID PROGRESSOF THE TRAVELLER WITH OUR TELESCOPES UNTIL HE WAS LOST AMONG THEDISTANT INEQUALITIES OF THE ICE.THIS APPEARANCE EXCITED OUR UNQUALIFIED WONDER. WE WERE AS WE BELIEVEDMANY HUNDRED MILES FROM ANY LAND BUT THIS APPARITION SEEMED TO DENOTE THATIT WAS NOT IN REALITY SO DISTANT AS WE HAD SUPPOSED. SHUT IN HOWEVER BYICE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW HIS TRACK WHICH WE HAD OBSERVED WITH THEGREATEST ATTENTION.ABOUT TWO HOURS AFTER THIS OCCURRENCE WE HEARD THE GROUND SEA AND BEFORENIGHT THE ICE BROKE AND FREED OUR SHIP. WE HOWEVER LAY TO UNTIL THEMORNING FEARING TO ENCOUNTER IN THE DARK THOSE LARGE LOOSE MASSES WHICHFLOAT ABOUT AFTER THE BREAKING UP OF THE ICE. I PROFITED OF THIS TIME TOREST FOR A FEW HOURS.IN THE MORNING HOWEVER AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT I WENT UPON DECK ANDFOUND ALL THE SAILORS BUSY ON ONE SIDE OF THE VESSEL APPARENTLYTALKING TO SOMEONE IN THE SEA. IT WAS IN FACT A SLEDGE LIKE THAT WEHAD SEEN BEFORE WHICH HAD DRIFTED TOWARDS US IN THE NIGHT ON A LARGEFRAGMENT OF ICE. ONLY ONE DOG REMAINED ALIVE BUT THERE WAS A HUMANBEING WITHIN IT WHOM THE SAILORS WERE PERSUADING TO ENTER THE VESSEL.HE WAS NOT AS THE OTHER TRAVELLER SEEMED TO BE A SAVAGE INHABITANT OFSOME UNDISCOVERED ISLAND BUT A EUROPEAN. WHEN I APPEARED ON DECK THEMASTER SAID HERE IS OUR CAPTAIN AND HE WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO PERISHON THE OPEN SEA.ON PERCEIVING ME THE STRANGER ADDRESSED ME IN ENGLISH ALTHOUGH WITH AFOREIGN ACCENT. BEFORE I COME ON BOARD YOUR VESSEL SAID HEWILL YOU HAVE THE KINDNESS TO INFORM ME WHITHER YOU ARE BOUNDYOU MAY CONCEIVE MY ASTONISHMENT ON HEARING SUCH A QUESTION ADDRESSEDTO ME FROM A MAN ON THE BRINK OF DESTRUCTION AND TO WHOM I SHOULD HAVESUPPOSED THAT MY VESSEL WOULD HAVE BEEN A RESOURCE WHICH HE WOULD NOTHAVE EXCHANGED FOR THE MOST PRECIOUS WEALTH THE EARTH CAN AFFORD. IREPLIED HOWEVER THAT WE WERE ON A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY TOWARDS THENORTHERN POLE.UPON HEARING THIS HE APPEARED SATISFIED AND CONSENTED TO COME ON BOARD.GOOD GOD MARGARET IF YOU HAD SEEN THE MAN WHO THUS CAPITULATED FORHIS SAFETY YOUR SURPRISE WOULD HAVE BEEN BOUNDLESS. HIS LIMBS WERENEARLY FROZEN AND HIS BODY DREADFULLY EMACIATED BY FATIGUE ANDSUFFERING. I NEVER SAW A MAN IN SO WRETCHED A CONDITION. WE ATTEMPTEDTO CARRY HIM INTO THE CABIN BUT AS SOON AS HE HAD QUITTED THE FRESHAIR HE FAINTED. WE ACCORDINGLY BROUGHT HIM BACK TO THE DECK ANDRESTORED HIM TO ANIMATION BY RUBBING HIM WITH BRANDY AND FORCING HIM TOSWALLOW A SMALL QUANTITY. AS SOON AS HE SHOWED SIGNS OF LIFE WEWRAPPED HIM UP IN BLANKETS AND PLACED HIM NEAR THE CHIMNEY OF THEKITCHEN STOVE. BY SLOW DEGREES HE RECOVERED AND ATE A LITTLE SOUPWHICH RESTORED HIM WONDERFULLY.TWO DAYS PASSED IN THIS MANNER BEFORE HE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK AND I OFTENFEARED THAT HIS SUFFERINGS HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF UNDERSTANDING. WHEN HEHAD IN SOME MEASURE RECOVERED I REMOVED HIM TO MY OWN CABIN ANDATTENDED ON HIM AS MUCH AS MY DUTY WOULD PERMIT. I NEVER SAW A MOREINTERESTING CREATURE HIS EYES HAVE GENERALLY AN EXPRESSION OFWILDNESS AND EVEN MADNESS BUT THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN IF ANYONEPERFORMS AN ACT OF KINDNESS TOWARDS HIM OR DOES HIM ANY THE MOSTTRIFLING SERVICE HIS WHOLE COUNTENANCE IS LIGHTED UP AS IT WERE WITHA BEAM OF BENEVOLENCE AND SWEETNESS THAT I NEVER SAW EQUALLED. BUT HEIS GENERALLY MELANCHOLY AND DESPAIRING AND SOMETIMES HE GNASHES HISTEETH AS IF IMPATIENT OF THE WEIGHT OF WOES THAT OPPRESSES HIM.WHEN MY GUEST WAS A LITTLE RECOVERED I HAD GREAT TROUBLE TO KEEP OFFTHE MEN WHO WISHED TO ASK HIM A THOUSAND QUESTIONS BUT I WOULD NOTALLOW HIM TO BE TORMENTED BY THEIR IDLE CURIOSITY IN A STATE OF BODYAND MIND WHOSE RESTORATION EVIDENTLY DEPENDED UPON ENTIRE REPOSE.ONCE HOWEVER THE LIEUTENANT ASKED WHY HE HAD COME SO FAR UPON THE ICEIN SO STRANGE A VEHICLE.HIS COUNTENANCE INSTANTLY ASSUMED AN ASPECT OF THE DEEPEST GLOOM ANDHE REPLIED TO SEEK ONE WHO FLED FROM ME.AND DID THE MAN WHOM YOU PURSUED TRAVEL IN THE SAME FASHIONYES.THEN I FANCY WE HAVE SEEN HIM FOR THE DAY BEFORE WE PICKED YOU UP WESAW SOME DOGS DRAWING A SLEDGE WITH A MAN IN IT ACROSS THE ICE.THIS AROUSED THE STRANGERS ATTENTION AND HE ASKED A MULTITUDE OFQUESTIONS CONCERNING THE ROUTE WHICH THE DMON AS HE CALLED HIM HADPURSUED. SOON AFTER WHEN HE WAS ALONE WITH ME HE SAID I HAVEDOUBTLESS EXCITED YOUR CURIOSITY AS WELL AS THAT OF THESE GOODPEOPLE BUT YOU ARE TOO CONSIDERATE TO MAKE INQUIRIES.CERTAINLY IT WOULD INDEED BE VERY IMPERTINENT AND INHUMAN IN ME TOTROUBLE YOU WITH ANY INQUISITIVENESS OF MINE.AND YET YOU RESCUED ME FROM A STRANGE AND PERILOUS SITUATION YOU HAVEBENEVOLENTLY RESTORED ME TO LIFE.SOON AFTER THIS HE INQUIRED IF I THOUGHT THAT THE BREAKING UP OF THEICE HAD DESTROYED THE OTHER SLEDGE. I REPLIED THAT I COULD NOT ANSWERWITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY FOR THE ICE HAD NOT BROKEN UNTIL NEARMIDNIGHT AND THE TRAVELLER MIGHT HAVE ARRIVED AT A PLACE OF SAFETYBEFORE THAT TIME BUT OF THIS I COULD NOT JUDGE.FROM THIS TIME A NEW SPIRIT OF LIFE ANIMATED THE DECAYING FRAME OF THESTRANGER. HE MANIFESTED THE GREATEST EAGERNESS TO BE UPON DECK TO WATCH FORTHE SLEDGE WHICH HAD BEFORE APPEARED BUT I HAVE PERSUADED HIM TO REMAIN INTHE CABIN FOR HE IS FAR TOO WEAK TO SUSTAIN THE RAWNESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE.I HAVE PROMISED THAT SOMEONE SHOULD WATCH FOR HIM AND GIVE HIM INSTANTNOTICE IF ANY NEW OBJECT SHOULD APPEAR IN SIGHT.SUCH IS MY JOURNAL OF WHAT RELATES TO THIS STRANGE OCCURRENCE UP TO THEPRESENT DAY. THE STRANGER HAS GRADUALLY IMPROVED IN HEALTH BUT IS VERYSILENT AND APPEARS UNEASY WHEN ANYONE EXCEPT MYSELF ENTERS HIS CABIN.YET HIS MANNERS ARE SO CONCILIATING AND GENTLE THAT THE SAILORS ARE ALLINTERESTED IN HIM ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE COMMUNICATIONWITH HIM. FOR MY OWN PART I BEGIN TO LOVE HIM AS A BROTHER AND HISCONSTANT AND DEEP GRIEF FILLS ME WITH SYMPATHY AND COMPASSION. HE MUSTHAVE BEEN A NOBLE CREATURE IN HIS BETTER DAYS BEING EVEN NOW IN WRECKSO ATTRACTIVE AND AMIABLE.I SAID IN ONE OF MY LETTERS MY DEAR MARGARET THAT I SHOULD FIND NO FRIENDON THE WIDE OCEAN YET I HAVE FOUND A MAN WHO BEFORE HIS SPIRIT HAD BEENBROKEN BY MISERY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO HAVE POSSESSED AS THE BROTHEROF MY HEART.I SHALL CONTINUE MY JOURNAL CONCERNING THE STRANGER AT INTERVALSSHOULD I HAVE ANY FRESH INCIDENTS TO RECORD.AUGUST TH .MY AFFECTION FOR MY GUEST INCREASES EVERY DAY. HE EXCITES AT ONCE MYADMIRATION AND MY PITY TO AN ASTONISHING DEGREE. HOW CAN I SEE SONOBLE A CREATURE DESTROYED BY MISERY WITHOUT FEELING THE MOST POIGNANTGRIEF HE IS SO GENTLE YET SO WISE HIS MIND IS SO CULTIVATED ANDWHEN HE SPEAKS ALTHOUGH HIS WORDS ARE CULLED WITH THE CHOICEST ARTYET THEY FLOW WITH RAPIDITY AND UNPARALLELED ELOQUENCE.HE IS NOW MUCH RECOVERED FROM HIS ILLNESS AND IS CONTINUALLY ON THE DECKAPPARENTLY WATCHING FOR THE SLEDGE THAT PRECEDED HIS OWN. YET ALTHOUGHUNHAPPY HE IS NOT SO UTTERLY OCCUPIED BY HIS OWN MISERY BUT THAT HEINTERESTS HIMSELF DEEPLY IN THE PROJECTS OF OTHERS. HE HAS FREQUENTLYCONVERSED WITH ME ON MINE WHICH I HAVE COMMUNICATED TO HIM WITHOUTDISGUISE. HE ENTERED ATTENTIVELY INTO ALL MY ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF MYEVENTUAL SUCCESS AND INTO EVERY MINUTE DETAIL OF THE MEASURES I HAD TAKENTO SECURE IT. I WAS EASILY LED BY THE SYMPATHY WHICH HE EVINCED TO USE THELANGUAGE OF MY HEART TO GIVE UTTERANCE TO THE BURNING ARDOUR OF MY SOULAND TO SAY WITH ALL THE FERVOUR THAT WARMED ME HOW GLADLY I WOULDSACRIFICE MY FORTUNE MY EXISTENCE MY EVERY HOPE TO THE FURTHERANCE OF MYENTERPRISE. ONE MANS LIFE OR DEATH WERE BUT A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FORTHE ACQUIREMENT OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH I SOUGHT FOR THE DOMINION I SHOULDACQUIRE AND TRANSMIT OVER THE ELEMENTAL FOES OF OUR RACE. AS I SPOKE ADARK GLOOM SPREAD OVER MY LISTENERS COUNTENANCE. AT FIRST IPERCEIVED THAT HE TRIED TO SUPPRESS HIS EMOTION HE PLACED HIS HANDS BEFOREHIS EYES AND MY VOICE QUIVERED AND FAILED ME AS I BEHELD TEARS TRICKLEFAST FROM BETWEEN HIS FINGERS A GROAN BURST FROM HIS HEAVING BREAST. IPAUSED AT LENGTH HE SPOKE IN BROKEN ACCENTS UNHAPPY MAN DO YOUSHARE MY MADNESS HAVE YOU DRUNK ALSO OF THE INTOXICATING DRAUGHT HEAR MELET ME REVEAL MY TALE AND YOU WILL DASH THE CUP FROM YOUR LIPSSUCH WORDS YOU MAY IMAGINE STRONGLY EXCITED MY CURIOSITY BUT THEPAROXYSM OF GRIEF THAT HAD SEIZED THE STRANGER OVERCAME HIS WEAKENEDPOWERS AND MANY HOURS OF REPOSE AND TRANQUIL CONVERSATION WERENECESSARY TO RESTORE HIS COMPOSURE.HAVING CONQUERED THE VIOLENCE OF HIS FEELINGS HE APPEARED TO DESPISEHIMSELF FOR BEING THE SLAVE OF PASSION AND QUELLING THE DARK TYRANNY OFDESPAIR HE LED ME AGAIN TO CONVERSE CONCERNING MYSELF PERSONALLY. HE ASKEDME THE HISTORY OF MY EARLIER YEARS. THE TALE WAS QUICKLY TOLD BUT ITAWAKENED VARIOUS TRAINS OF REFLECTION. I SPOKE OF MY DESIRE OF FINDING AFRIEND OF MY THIRST FOR A MORE INTIMATE SYMPATHY WITH A FELLOW MIND THANHAD EVER FALLEN TO MY LOT AND EXPRESSED MY CONVICTION THAT A MAN COULDBOAST OF LITTLE HAPPINESS WHO DID NOT ENJOY THIS BLESSING.I AGREE WITH YOU REPLIED THE STRANGER WE AREUNFASHIONED CREATURES BUT HALF MADE UP IF ONE WISER BETTER DEARER THANOURSELVESSUCH A FRIEND OUGHT TO BEDO NOT LEND HIS AID TOPERFECTIONATE OUR WEAK AND FAULTY NATURES. I ONCE HAD A FRIEND THE MOSTNOBLE OF HUMAN CREATURES AND AM ENTITLED THEREFORE TO JUDGE RESPECTINGFRIENDSHIP. YOU HAVE HOPE AND THE WORLD BEFORE YOU AND HAVE NO CAUSE FORDESPAIR. BUT II HAVE LOST EVERYTHING AND CANNOT BEGIN LIFEANEW.AS HE SAID THIS HIS COUNTENANCE BECAME EXPRESSIVE OF A CALM SETTLEDGRIEF THAT TOUCHED ME TO THE HEART. BUT HE WAS SILENT AND PRESENTLYRETIRED TO HIS CABIN.EVEN BROKEN IN SPIRIT AS HE IS NO ONE CAN FEEL MORE DEEPLY THAN HEDOES THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE. THE STARRY SKY THE SEA AND EVERY SIGHTAFFORDED BY THESE WONDERFUL REGIONS SEEM STILL TO HAVE THE POWER OFELEVATING HIS SOUL FROM EARTH. SUCH A MAN HAS A DOUBLE EXISTENCE HEMAY SUFFER MISERY AND BE OVERWHELMED BY DISAPPOINTMENTS YET WHEN HEHAS RETIRED INTO HIMSELF HE WILL BE LIKE A CELESTIAL SPIRIT THAT HAS AHALO AROUND HIM WITHIN WHOSE CIRCLE NO GRIEF OR FOLLY VENTURES.WILL YOU SMILE AT THE ENTHUSIASM I EXPRESS CONCERNING THIS DIVINEWANDERER YOU WOULD NOT IF YOU SAW HIM. YOU HAVE BEEN TUTORED ANDREFINED BY BOOKS AND RETIREMENT FROM THE WORLD AND YOU ARE THEREFORESOMEWHAT FASTIDIOUS BUT THIS ONLY RENDERS YOU THE MORE FIT TOAPPRECIATE THE EXTRAORDINARY MERITS OF THIS WONDERFUL MAN. SOMETIMES IHAVE ENDEAVOURED TO DISCOVER WHAT QUALITY IT IS WHICH HE POSSESSES THATELEVATES HIM SO IMMEASURABLY ABOVE ANY OTHER PERSON I EVER KNEW. IBELIEVE IT TO BE AN INTUITIVE DISCERNMENT A QUICK BUT NEVERFAILINGPOWER OF JUDGMENT A PENETRATION INTO THE CAUSES OF THINGS UNEQUALLEDFOR CLEARNESS AND PRECISION ADD TO THIS A FACILITY OF EXPRESSION AND AVOICE WHOSE VARIED INTONATIONS ARE SOULSUBDUING MUSIC.AUGUST TH .YESTERDAY THE STRANGER SAID TO ME YOU MAY EASILY PERCEIVE CAPTAINWALTON THAT I HAVE SUFFERED GREAT AND UNPARALLELED MISFORTUNES. I HADDETERMINED AT ONE TIME THAT THE MEMORY OF THESE EVILS SHOULD DIE WITHME BUT YOU HAVE WON ME TO ALTER MY DETERMINATION. YOU SEEK FORKNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM AS I ONCE DID AND I ARDENTLY HOPE THAT THEGRATIFICATION OF YOUR WISHES MAY NOT BE A SERPENT TO STING YOU AS MINEHAS BEEN. I DO NOT KNOW THAT THE RELATION OF MY DISASTERS WILL BEUSEFUL TO YOU YET WHEN I REFLECT THAT YOU ARE PURSUING THE SAMECOURSE EXPOSING YOURSELF TO THE SAME DANGERS WHICH HAVE RENDERED MEWHAT I AM I IMAGINE THAT YOU MAY DEDUCE AN APT MORAL FROM MY TALE ONETHAT MAY DIRECT YOU IF YOU SUCCEED IN YOUR UNDERTAKING AND CONSOLE YOUIN CASE OF FAILURE. PREPARE TO HEAR OF OCCURRENCES WHICH ARE USUALLYDEEMED MARVELLOUS. WERE WE AMONG THE TAMER SCENES OF NATURE I MIGHTFEAR TO ENCOUNTER YOUR UNBELIEF PERHAPS YOUR RIDICULE BUT MANY THINGSWILL APPEAR POSSIBLE IN THESE WILD AND MYSTERIOUS REGIONS WHICH WOULDPROVOKE THE LAUGHTER OF THOSE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE EVERVARIED POWERSOF NATURE NOR CAN I DOUBT BUT THAT MY TALE CONVEYS IN ITS SERIESINTERNAL EVIDENCE OF THE TRUTH OF THE EVENTS OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED.YOU MAY EASILY IMAGINE THAT I WAS MUCH GRATIFIED BY THE OFFEREDCOMMUNICATION YET I COULD NOT ENDURE THAT HE SHOULD RENEW HIS GRIEF BYA RECITAL OF HIS MISFORTUNES. I FELT THE GREATEST EAGERNESS TO HEARTHE PROMISED NARRATIVE PARTLY FROM CURIOSITY AND PARTLY FROM A STRONGDESIRE TO AMELIORATE HIS FATE IF IT WERE IN MY POWER. I EXPRESSEDTHESE FEELINGS IN MY ANSWER.I THANK YOU HE REPLIED FOR YOUR SYMPATHY BUT IT ISUSELESS MY FATE IS NEARLY FULFILLED. I WAIT BUT FOR ONE EVENT AND THEN ISHALL REPOSE IN PEACE. I UNDERSTAND YOUR FEELING CONTINUED HEPERCEIVING THAT I WISHED TO INTERRUPT HIM BUT YOU ARE MISTAKEN MYFRIEND IF THUS YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO NAME YOU NOTHING CAN ALTER MYDESTINY LISTEN TO MY HISTORY AND YOU WILL PERCEIVE HOW IRREVOCABLY IT ISDETERMINED.HE THEN TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD COMMENCE HIS NARRATIVE THE NEXT DAY WHEN ISHOULD BE AT LEISURE. THIS PROMISE DREW FROM ME THE WARMEST THANKS. I HAVERESOLVED EVERY NIGHT WHEN I AM NOT IMPERATIVELY OCCUPIED BY MY DUTIES TORECORD AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE IN HIS OWN WORDS WHAT HE HAS RELATED DURINGTHE DAY. IF I SHOULD BE ENGAGED I WILL AT LEAST MAKE NOTES. THISMANUSCRIPT WILL DOUBTLESS AFFORD YOU THE GREATEST PLEASURE BUT TO ME WHOKNOW HIM AND WHO HEAR IT FROM HIS OWN LIPSWITH WHAT INTEREST ANDSYMPATHY SHALL I READ IT IN SOME FUTURE DAY EVEN NOW AS I COMMENCE MYTASK HIS FULLTONED VOICE SWELLS IN MY EARS HIS LUSTROUS EYES DWELL ON MEWITH ALL THEIR MELANCHOLY SWEETNESS I SEE HIS THIN HAND RAISED INANIMATION WHILE THE LINEAMENTS OF HIS FACE ARE IRRADIATED BY THE SOULWITHIN. STRANGE AND HARROWING MUST BE HIS STORY FRIGHTFUL THE STORM WHICHEMBRACED THE GALLANT VESSEL ON ITS COURSE AND WRECKED ITTHUSCHAPTER I AM BY BIRTH A GENEVESE AND MY FAMILY IS ONE OF THE MOSTDISTINGUISHED OF THAT REPUBLIC. MY ANCESTORS HAD BEEN FOR MANY YEARSCOUNSELLORS AND SYNDICS AND MY FATHER HAD FILLED SEVERAL PUBLICSITUATIONS WITH HONOUR AND REPUTATION. HE WAS RESPECTED BY ALL WHOKNEW HIM FOR HIS INTEGRITY AND INDEFATIGABLE ATTENTION TO PUBLICBUSINESS. HE PASSED HIS YOUNGER DAYS PERPETUALLY OCCUPIED BY THEAFFAIRS OF HIS COUNTRY A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES HAD PREVENTED HISMARRYING EARLY NOR WAS IT UNTIL THE DECLINE OF LIFE THAT HE BECAME AHUSBAND AND THE FATHER OF A FAMILY.AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS MARRIAGE ILLUSTRATE HIS CHARACTER I CANNOTREFRAIN FROM RELATING THEM. ONE OF HIS MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS WAS AMERCHANT WHO FROM A FLOURISHING STATE FELL THROUGH NUMEROUSMISCHANCES INTO POVERTY. THIS MAN WHOSE NAME WAS BEAUFORT WAS OF APROUD AND UNBENDING DISPOSITION AND COULD NOT BEAR TO LIVE IN POVERTYAND OBLIVION IN THE SAME COUNTRY WHERE HE HAD FORMERLY BEENDISTINGUISHED FOR HIS RANK AND MAGNIFICENCE. HAVING PAID HIS DEBTSTHEREFORE IN THE MOST HONOURABLE MANNER HE RETREATED WITH HISDAUGHTER TO THE TOWN OF LUCERNE WHERE HE LIVED UNKNOWN AND INWRETCHEDNESS. MY FATHER LOVED BEAUFORT WITH THE TRUEST FRIENDSHIP ANDWAS DEEPLY GRIEVED BY HIS RETREAT IN THESE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES.HE BITTERLY DEPLORED THE FALSE PRIDE WHICH LED HIS FRIEND TO A CONDUCTSO LITTLE WORTHY OF THE AFFECTION THAT UNITED THEM. HE LOST NO TIME INENDEAVOURING TO SEEK HIM OUT WITH THE HOPE OF PERSUADING HIM TO BEGINTHE WORLD AGAIN THROUGH HIS CREDIT AND ASSISTANCE.BEAUFORT HAD TAKEN EFFECTUAL MEASURES TO CONCEAL HIMSELF AND IT WAS TENMONTHS BEFORE MY FATHER DISCOVERED HIS ABODE. OVERJOYED AT THIS DISCOVERYHE HASTENED TO THE HOUSE WHICH WAS SITUATED IN A MEAN STREET NEAR THEREUSS. BUT WHEN HE ENTERED MISERY AND DESPAIR ALONE WELCOMED HIM. BEAUFORTHAD SAVED BUT A VERY SMALL SUM OF MONEY FROM THE WRECK OF HIS FORTUNES BUTIT WAS SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE HIM WITH SUSTENANCE FOR SOME MONTHS AND INTHE MEANTIME HE HOPED TO PROCURE SOME RESPECTABLE EMPLOYMENT IN AMERCHANTS HOUSE. THE INTERVAL WAS CONSEQUENTLY SPENT IN INACTIONHIS GRIEF ONLY BECAME MORE DEEP AND RANKLING WHEN HE HAD LEISURE FORREFLECTION AND AT LENGTH IT TOOK SO FAST HOLD OF HIS MIND THAT AT THE ENDOF THREE MONTHS HE LAY ON A BED OF SICKNESS INCAPABLE OF ANY EXERTION.HIS DAUGHTER ATTENDED HIM WITH THE GREATEST TENDERNESS BUT SHE SAWWITH DESPAIR THAT THEIR LITTLE FUND WAS RAPIDLY DECREASING AND THATTHERE WAS NO OTHER PROSPECT OF SUPPORT. BUT CAROLINE BEAUFORTPOSSESSED A MIND OF AN UNCOMMON MOULD AND HER COURAGE ROSE TO SUPPORTHER IN HER ADVERSITY. SHE PROCURED PLAIN WORK SHE PLAITED STRAW ANDBY VARIOUS MEANS CONTRIVED TO EARN A PITTANCE SCARCELY SUFFICIENT TOSUPPORT LIFE.SEVERAL MONTHS PASSED IN THIS MANNER. HER FATHER GREW WORSE HER TIMEWAS MORE ENTIRELY OCCUPIED IN ATTENDING HIM HER MEANS OF SUBSISTENCEDECREASED AND IN THE TENTH MONTH HER FATHER DIED IN HER ARMS LEAVINGHER AN ORPHAN AND A BEGGAR. THIS LAST BLOW OVERCAME HER AND SHE KNELTBY BEAUFORTS COFFIN WEEPING BITTERLY WHEN MY FATHER ENTERED THECHAMBER. HE CAME LIKE A PROTECTING SPIRIT TO THE POOR GIRL WHOCOMMITTED HERSELF TO HIS CARE AND AFTER THE INTERMENT OF HIS FRIEND HECONDUCTED HER TO GENEVA AND PLACED HER UNDER THE PROTECTION OF ARELATION. TWO YEARS AFTER THIS EVENT CAROLINE BECAME HIS WIFE.THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AGES OF MY PARENTS BUTTHIS CIRCUMSTANCE SEEMED TO UNITE THEM ONLY CLOSER IN BONDS OF DEVOTEDAFFECTION. THERE WAS A SENSE OF JUSTICE IN MY FATHERS UPRIGHT MINDWHICH RENDERED IT NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD APPROVE HIGHLY TO LOVESTRONGLY. PERHAPS DURING FORMER YEARS HE HAD SUFFERED FROM THELATEDISCOVERED UNWORTHINESS OF ONE BELOVED AND SO WAS DISPOSED TO SETA GREATER VALUE ON TRIED WORTH. THERE WAS A SHOW OF GRATITUDE ANDWORSHIP IN HIS ATTACHMENT TO MY MOTHER DIFFERING WHOLLY FROM THEDOTING FONDNESS OF AGE FOR IT WAS INSPIRED BY REVERENCE FOR HERVIRTUES AND A DESIRE TO BE THE MEANS OF IN SOME DEGREE RECOMPENSINGHER FOR THE SORROWS SHE HAD ENDURED BUT WHICH GAVE INEXPRESSIBLE GRACETO HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER. EVERYTHING WAS MADE TO YIELD TO HER WISHESAND HER CONVENIENCE. HE STROVE TO SHELTER HER AS A FAIR EXOTIC ISSHELTERED BY THE GARDENER FROM EVERY ROUGHER WIND AND TO SURROUND HERWITH ALL THAT COULD TEND TO EXCITE PLEASURABLE EMOTION IN HER SOFT ANDBENEVOLENT MIND. HER HEALTH AND EVEN THE TRANQUILLITY OF HER HITHERTOCONSTANT SPIRIT HAD BEEN SHAKEN BY WHAT SHE HAD GONE THROUGH. DURINGTHE TWO YEARS THAT HAD ELAPSED PREVIOUS TO THEIR MARRIAGE MY FATHER HADGRADUALLY RELINQUISHED ALL HIS PUBLIC FUNCTIONS AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERTHEIR UNION THEY SOUGHT THE PLEASANT CLIMATE OF ITALY AND THE CHANGEOF SCENE AND INTEREST ATTENDANT ON A TOUR THROUGH THAT LAND OF WONDERSAS A RESTORATIVE FOR HER WEAKENED FRAME.FROM ITALY THEY VISITED GERMANY AND FRANCE. I THEIR ELDEST CHILD WAS BORNAT NAPLES AND AS AN INFANT ACCOMPANIED THEM IN THEIR RAMBLES. I REMAINEDFOR SEVERAL YEARS THEIR ONLY CHILD. MUCH AS THEY WERE ATTACHED TO EACHOTHER THEY SEEMED TO DRAW INEXHAUSTIBLE STORES OF AFFECTION FROM A VERYMINE OF LOVE TO BESTOW THEM UPON ME. MY MOTHERS TENDER CARESSES ANDMY FATHERS SMILE OF BENEVOLENT PLEASURE WHILE REGARDING ME ARE MYFIRST RECOLLECTIONS. I WAS THEIR PLAYTHING AND THEIR IDOL AND SOMETHINGBETTERTHEIR CHILD THE INNOCENT AND HELPLESS CREATURE BESTOWED ONTHEM BY HEAVEN WHOM TO BRING UP TO GOOD AND WHOSE FUTURE LOT IT WAS INTHEIR HANDS TO DIRECT TO HAPPINESS OR MISERY ACCORDING AS THEY FULFILLEDTHEIR DUTIES TOWARDS ME. WITH THIS DEEP CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHAT THEY OWEDTOWARDS THE BEING TO WHICH THEY HAD GIVEN LIFE ADDED TO THE ACTIVE SPIRITOF TENDERNESS THAT ANIMATED BOTH IT MAY BE IMAGINED THAT WHILE DURINGEVERY HOUR OF MY INFANT LIFE I RECEIVED A LESSON OF PATIENCE OF CHARITYAND OF SELFCONTROL I WAS SO GUIDED BY A SILKEN CORD THAT ALL SEEMED BUTONE TRAIN OF ENJOYMENT TO ME.FOR A LONG TIME I WAS THEIR ONLY CARE. MY MOTHER HAD MUCH DESIRED TO HAVE ADAUGHTER BUT I CONTINUED THEIR SINGLE OFFSPRING. WHEN I WAS ABOUT FIVEYEARS OLD WHILE MAKING AN EXCURSION BEYOND THE FRONTIERS OF ITALY THEYPASSED A WEEK ON THE SHORES OF THE LAKE OF COMO. THEIR BENEVOLENTDISPOSITION OFTEN MADE THEM ENTER THE COTTAGES OF THE POOR. THIS TO MYMOTHER WAS MORE THAN A DUTY IT WAS A NECESSITY APASSIONREMEMBERING WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED AND HOW SHE HAD BEENRELIEVEDFOR HER TO ACT IN HER TURN THE GUARDIAN ANGEL TO THEAFFLICTED. DURING ONE OF THEIR WALKS A POOR COT IN THE FOLDINGS OF A VALEATTRACTED THEIR NOTICE AS BEING SINGULARLY DISCONSOLATE WHILE THE NUMBEROF HALFCLOTHED CHILDREN GATHERED ABOUT IT SPOKE OF PENURY IN ITS WORSTSHAPE. ONE DAY WHEN MY FATHER HAD GONE BY HIMSELF TO MILAN MY MOTHERACCOMPANIED BY ME VISITED THIS ABODE. SHE FOUND A PEASANT AND HIS WIFEHARD WORKING BENT DOWN BY CARE AND LABOUR DISTRIBUTING A SCANTY MEAL TOFIVE HUNGRY BABES. AMONG THESE THERE WAS ONE WHICH ATTRACTED MY MOTHER FARABOVE ALL THE REST. SHE APPEARED OF A DIFFERENT STOCK. THE FOUR OTHERS WEREDARKEYED HARDY LITTLE VAGRANTS THIS CHILD WAS THIN AND VERY FAIR. HERHAIR WAS THE BRIGHTEST LIVING GOLD AND DESPITE THE POVERTY OF HERCLOTHING SEEMED TO SET A CROWN OF DISTINCTION ON HER HEAD. HER BROW WASCLEAR AND AMPLE HER BLUE EYES CLOUDLESS AND HER LIPS AND THE MOULDING OFHER FACE SO EXPRESSIVE OF SENSIBILITY AND SWEETNESS THAT NONE COULD BEHOLDHER WITHOUT LOOKING ON HER AS OF A DISTINCT SPECIES A BEING HEAVENSENTAND BEARING A CELESTIAL STAMP IN ALL HER FEATURES.THE PEASANT WOMAN PERCEIVING THAT MY MOTHER FIXED EYES OF WONDER ANDADMIRATION ON THIS LOVELY GIRL EAGERLY COMMUNICATED HER HISTORY. SHE WASNOT HER CHILD BUT THE DAUGHTER OF A MILANESE NOBLEMAN. HER MOTHER WAS AGERMAN AND HAD DIED ON GIVING HER BIRTH. THE INFANT HAD BEEN PLACED WITHTHESE GOOD PEOPLE TO NURSE THEY WERE BETTER OFF THEN. THEY HAD NOT BEENLONG MARRIED AND THEIR ELDEST CHILD WAS BUT JUST BORN. THE FATHER OF THEIRCHARGE WAS ONE OF THOSE ITALIANS NURSED IN THE MEMORY OF THE ANTIQUE GLORYOF ITALYONE AMONG THE SCHIAVI OGNOR FREMENTI WHO EXERTEDHIMSELF TO OBTAIN THE LIBERTY OF HIS COUNTRY. HE BECAME THE VICTIM OF ITSWEAKNESS. WHETHER HE HAD DIED OR STILL LINGERED IN THE DUNGEONS OF AUSTRIAWAS NOT KNOWN. HIS PROPERTY WAS CONFISCATED HIS CHILD BECAME AN ORPHAN ANDA BEGGAR. SHE CONTINUED WITH HER FOSTER PARENTS AND BLOOMED IN THEIR RUDEABODE FAIRER THAN A GARDEN ROSE AMONG DARKLEAVED BRAMBLES.WHEN MY FATHER RETURNED FROM MILAN HE FOUND PLAYING WITH ME IN THE HALL OFOUR VILLA A CHILD FAIRER THAN PICTURED CHERUBA CREATURE WHO SEEMEDTO SHED RADIANCE FROM HER LOOKS AND WHOSE FORM AND MOTIONS WERE LIGHTERTHAN THE CHAMOIS OF THE HILLS. THE APPARITION WAS SOON EXPLAINED. WITH HISPERMISSION MY MOTHER PREVAILED ON HER RUSTIC GUARDIANS TO YIELD THEIRCHARGE TO HER. THEY WERE FOND OF THE SWEET ORPHAN. HER PRESENCE HAD SEEMEDA BLESSING TO THEM BUT IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO HER TO KEEP HER IN POVERTYAND WANT WHEN PROVIDENCE AFFORDED HER SUCH POWERFUL PROTECTION. THEYCONSULTED THEIR VILLAGE PRIEST AND THE RESULT WAS THAT ELIZABETH LAVENZABECAME THE INMATE OF MY PARENTS HOUSEMY MORE THANSISTERTHE BEAUTIFUL AND ADORED COMPANION OF ALL MY OCCUPATIONS ANDMY PLEASURES.EVERYONE LOVED ELIZABETH. THE PASSIONATE AND ALMOST REVERENTIALATTACHMENT WITH WHICH ALL REGARDED HER BECAME WHILE I SHARED IT MYPRIDE AND MY DELIGHT. ON THE EVENING PREVIOUS TO HER BEING BROUGHT TOMY HOME MY MOTHER HAD SAID PLAYFULLY I HAVE A PRETTY PRESENT FOR MYVICTORTOMORROW HE SHALL HAVE IT. AND WHEN ON THE MORROW SHEPRESENTED ELIZABETH TO ME AS HER PROMISED GIFT I WITH CHILDISHSERIOUSNESS INTERPRETED HER WORDS LITERALLY AND LOOKED UPON ELIZABETHAS MINEMINE TO PROTECT LOVE AND CHERISH. ALL PRAISES BESTOWED ONHER I RECEIVED AS MADE TO A POSSESSION OF MY OWN. WE CALLED EACH OTHERFAMILIARLY BY THE NAME OF COUSIN. NO WORD NO EXPRESSION COULD BODYFORTH THE KIND OF RELATION IN WHICH SHE STOOD TO MEMY MORE THANSISTER SINCE TILL DEATH SHE WAS TO BE MINE ONLY.CHAPTER WE WERE BROUGHT UP TOGETHER THERE WAS NOT QUITE A YEAR DIFFERENCE INOUR AGES. I NEED NOT SAY THAT WE WERE STRANGERS TO ANY SPECIES OFDISUNION OR DISPUTE. HARMONY WAS THE SOUL OF OUR COMPANIONSHIP ANDTHE DIVERSITY AND CONTRAST THAT SUBSISTED IN OUR CHARACTERS DREW USNEARER TOGETHER. ELIZABETH WAS OF A CALMER AND MORE CONCENTRATEDDISPOSITION BUT WITH ALL MY ARDOUR I WAS CAPABLE OF A MORE INTENSEAPPLICATION AND WAS MORE DEEPLY SMITTEN WITH THE THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE.SHE BUSIED HERSELF WITH FOLLOWING THE AERIAL CREATIONS OF THE POETSAND IN THE MAJESTIC AND WONDROUS SCENES WHICH SURROUNDED OUR SWISSHOME THE SUBLIME SHAPES OF THE MOUNTAINS THE CHANGES OF THE SEASONSTEMPEST AND CALM THE SILENCE OF WINTER AND THE LIFE AND TURBULENCE OFOUR ALPINE SUMMERSSHE FOUND AMPLE SCOPE FOR ADMIRATION AND DELIGHT.WHILE MY COMPANION CONTEMPLATED WITH A SERIOUS AND SATISFIED SPIRIT THEMAGNIFICENT APPEARANCES OF THINGS I DELIGHTED IN INVESTIGATING THEIRCAUSES. THE WORLD WAS TO ME A SECRET WHICH I DESIRED TO DIVINE.CURIOSITY EARNEST RESEARCH TO LEARN THE HIDDEN LAWS OF NATUREGLADNESS AKIN TO RAPTURE AS THEY WERE UNFOLDED TO ME ARE AMONG THEEARLIEST SENSATIONS I CAN REMEMBER.ON THE BIRTH OF A SECOND SON MY JUNIOR BY SEVEN YEARS MY PARENTS GAVEUP ENTIRELY THEIR WANDERING LIFE AND FIXED THEMSELVES IN THEIR NATIVECOUNTRY. WE POSSESSED A HOUSE IN GENEVA AND A CAMPAGNE ON BELRIVETHE EASTERN SHORE OF THE LAKE AT THE DISTANCE OF RATHER MORE THAN ALEAGUE FROM THE CITY. WE RESIDED PRINCIPALLY IN THE LATTER AND THELIVES OF MY PARENTS WERE PASSED IN CONSIDERABLE SECLUSION. IT WAS MYTEMPER TO AVOID A CROWD AND TO ATTACH MYSELF FERVENTLY TO A FEW. I WASINDIFFERENT THEREFORE TO MY SCHOOLFELLOWS IN GENERAL BUT I UNITEDMYSELF IN THE BONDS OF THE CLOSEST FRIENDSHIP TO ONE AMONG THEM. HENRYCLERVAL WAS THE SON OF A MERCHANT OF GENEVA. HE WAS A BOY OF SINGULARTALENT AND FANCY. HE LOVED ENTERPRISE HARDSHIP AND EVEN DANGER FORITS OWN SAKE. HE WAS DEEPLY READ IN BOOKS OF CHIVALRY AND ROMANCE. HECOMPOSED HEROIC SONGS AND BEGAN TO WRITE MANY A TALE OF ENCHANTMENT ANDKNIGHTLY ADVENTURE. HE TRIED TO MAKE US ACT PLAYS AND TO ENTER INTOMASQUERADES IN WHICH THE CHARACTERS WERE DRAWN FROM THE HEROES OFRONCESVALLES OF THE ROUND TABLE OF KING ARTHUR AND THE CHIVALROUSTRAIN WHO SHED THEIR BLOOD TO REDEEM THE HOLY SEPULCHRE FROM THE HANDSOF THE INFIDELS.NO HUMAN BEING COULD HAVE PASSED A HAPPIER CHILDHOOD THAN MYSELF. MYPARENTS WERE POSSESSED BY THE VERY SPIRIT OF KINDNESS AND INDULGENCE.WE FELT THAT THEY WERE NOT THE TYRANTS TO RULE OUR LOT ACCORDING TOTHEIR CAPRICE BUT THE AGENTS AND CREATORS OF ALL THE MANY DELIGHTSWHICH WE ENJOYED. WHEN I MINGLED WITH OTHER FAMILIES I DISTINCTLYDISCERNED HOW PECULIARLY FORTUNATE MY LOT WAS AND GRATITUDE ASSISTEDTHE DEVELOPMENT OF FILIAL LOVE.MY TEMPER WAS SOMETIMES VIOLENT AND MY PASSIONS VEHEMENT BUT BY SOMELAW IN MY TEMPERATURE THEY WERE TURNED NOT TOWARDS CHILDISH PURSUITSBUT TO AN EAGER DESIRE TO LEARN AND NOT TO LEARN ALL THINGSINDISCRIMINATELY. I CONFESS THAT NEITHER THE STRUCTURE OF LANGUAGESNOR THE CODE OF GOVERNMENTS NOR THE POLITICS OF VARIOUS STATESPOSSESSED ATTRACTIONS FOR ME. IT WAS THE SECRETS OF HEAVEN AND EARTHTHAT I DESIRED TO LEARN AND WHETHER IT WAS THE OUTWARD SUBSTANCE OFTHINGS OR THE INNER SPIRIT OF NATURE AND THE MYSTERIOUS SOUL OF MANTHAT OCCUPIED ME STILL MY INQUIRIES WERE DIRECTED TO THE METAPHYSICALOR IN ITS HIGHEST SENSE THE PHYSICAL SECRETS OF THE WORLD.MEANWHILE CLERVAL OCCUPIED HIMSELF SO TO SPEAK WITH THE MORALRELATIONS OF THINGS. THE BUSY STAGE OF LIFE THE VIRTUES OF HEROESAND THE ACTIONS OF MEN WERE HIS THEME AND HIS HOPE AND HIS DREAM WASTO BECOME ONE AMONG THOSE WHOSE NAMES ARE RECORDED IN STORY AS THEGALLANT AND ADVENTUROUS BENEFACTORS OF OUR SPECIES. THE SAINTLY SOULOF ELIZABETH SHONE LIKE A SHRINEDEDICATED LAMP IN OUR PEACEFUL HOME.HER SYMPATHY WAS OURS HER SMILE HER SOFT VOICE THE SWEET GLANCE OFHER CELESTIAL EYES WERE EVER THERE TO BLESS AND ANIMATE US. SHE WASTHE LIVING SPIRIT OF LOVE TO SOFTEN AND ATTRACT I MIGHT HAVE BECOMESULLEN IN MY STUDY ROUGH THROUGH THE ARDOUR OF MY NATURE BUT THATSHE WAS THERE TO SUBDUE ME TO A SEMBLANCE OF HER OWN GENTLENESS. ANDCLERVALCOULD AUGHT ILL ENTRENCH ON THE NOBLE SPIRIT OF CLERVAL YETHE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SO PERFECTLY HUMANE SO THOUGHTFUL IN HISGENEROSITY SO FULL OF KINDNESS AND TENDERNESS AMIDST HIS PASSION FORADVENTUROUS EXPLOIT HAD SHE NOT UNFOLDED TO HIM THE REAL LOVELINESS OFBENEFICENCE AND MADE THE DOING GOOD THE END AND AIM OF HIS SOARINGAMBITION.I FEEL EXQUISITE PLEASURE IN DWELLING ON THE RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOODBEFORE MISFORTUNE HAD TAINTED MY MIND AND CHANGED ITS BRIGHT VISIONS OFEXTENSIVE USEFULNESS INTO GLOOMY AND NARROW REFLECTIONS UPON SELF. BESIDESIN DRAWING THE PICTURE OF MY EARLY DAYS I ALSO RECORD THOSE EVENTS WHICHLED BY INSENSIBLE STEPS TO MY AFTER TALE OF MISERY FOR WHEN I WOULDACCOUNT TO MYSELF FOR THE BIRTH OF THAT PASSION WHICH AFTERWARDS RULED MYDESTINY I FIND IT ARISE LIKE A MOUNTAIN RIVER FROM IGNOBLE AND ALMOSTFORGOTTEN SOURCES BUT SWELLING AS IT PROCEEDED IT BECAME THE TORRENTWHICH IN ITS COURSE HAS SWEPT AWAY ALL MY HOPES AND JOYS.NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IS THE GENIUS THAT HAS REGULATED MY FATE I DESIRETHEREFORE IN THIS NARRATION TO STATE THOSE FACTS WHICH LED TO MYPREDILECTION FOR THAT SCIENCE. WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE WE ALL WENTON A PARTY OF PLEASURE TO THE BATHS NEAR THONON THE INCLEMENCY OF THEWEATHER OBLIGED US TO REMAIN A DAY CONFINED TO THE INN. IN THIS HOUSE ICHANCED TO FIND A VOLUME OF THE WORKS OF CORNELIUS AGRIPPA. I OPENED ITWITH APATHY THE THEORY WHICH HE ATTEMPTS TO DEMONSTRATE AND THE WONDERFULFACTS WHICH HE RELATES SOON CHANGED THIS FEELING INTO ENTHUSIASM. A NEWLIGHT SEEMED TO DAWN UPON MY MIND AND BOUNDING WITH JOY I COMMUNICATED MYDISCOVERY TO MY FATHER. MY FATHER LOOKED CARELESSLY AT THE TITLE PAGE OF MYBOOK AND SAID AH CORNELIUS AGRIPPA MY DEAR VICTOR DO NOT WASTEYOUR TIME UPON THIS IT IS SAD TRASH.IF INSTEAD OF THIS REMARK MY FATHER HAD TAKEN THE PAINS TO EXPLAIN TO METHAT THE PRINCIPLES OF AGRIPPA HAD BEEN ENTIRELY EXPLODED AND THAT A MODERNSYSTEM OF SCIENCE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED WHICH POSSESSED MUCH GREATER POWERSTHAN THE ANCIENT BECAUSE THE POWERS OF THE LATTER WERE CHIMERICAL WHILETHOSE OF THE FORMER WERE REAL AND PRACTICAL UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES ISHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE THROWN AGRIPPA ASIDE AND HAVE CONTENTED MYIMAGINATION WARMED AS IT WAS BY RETURNING WITH GREATER ARDOUR TO MYFORMER STUDIES. IT IS EVEN POSSIBLE THAT THE TRAIN OF MY IDEAS WOULD NEVERHAVE RECEIVED THE FATAL IMPULSE THAT LED TO MY RUIN. BUT THE CURSORY GLANCEMY FATHER HAD TAKEN OF MY VOLUME BY NO MEANS ASSURED ME THAT HE WASACQUAINTED WITH ITS CONTENTS AND I CONTINUED TO READ WITH THE GREATESTAVIDITY.WHEN I RETURNED HOME MY FIRST CARE WAS TO PROCURE THE WHOLE WORKS OF THISAUTHOR AND AFTERWARDS OF PARACELSUS AND ALBERTUS MAGNUS. I READ ANDSTUDIED THE WILD FANCIES OF THESE WRITERS WITH DELIGHT THEY APPEARED TO METREASURES KNOWN TO FEW BESIDES MYSELF. I HAVE DESCRIBED MYSELF AS ALWAYSHAVING BEEN IMBUED WITH A FERVENT LONGING TO PENETRATE THE SECRETS OFNATURE. IN SPITE OF THE INTENSE LABOUR AND WONDERFUL DISCOVERIES OF MODERNPHILOSOPHERS I ALWAYS CAME FROM MY STUDIES DISCONTENTED AND UNSATISFIED.SIR ISAAC NEWTON IS SAID TO HAVE AVOWED THAT HE FELT LIKE A CHILD PICKINGUP SHELLS BESIDE THE GREAT AND UNEXPLORED OCEAN OF TRUTH. THOSE OF HISSUCCESSORS IN EACH BRANCH OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY WITH WHOM I WAS ACQUAINTEDAPPEARED EVEN TO MY BOYS APPREHENSIONS AS TYROS ENGAGED IN THE SAMEPURSUIT.THE UNTAUGHT PEASANT BEHELD THE ELEMENTS AROUND HIM AND WAS ACQUAINTEDWITH THEIR PRACTICAL USES. THE MOST LEARNED PHILOSOPHER KNEW LITTLEMORE. HE HAD PARTIALLY UNVEILED THE FACE OF NATURE BUT HER IMMORTALLINEAMENTS WERE STILL A WONDER AND A MYSTERY. HE MIGHT DISSECTANATOMISE AND GIVE NAMES BUT NOT TO SPEAK OF A FINAL CAUSE CAUSESIN THEIR SECONDARY AND TERTIARY GRADES WERE UTTERLY UNKNOWN TO HIM. IHAD GAZED UPON THE FORTIFICATIONS AND IMPEDIMENTS THAT SEEMED TO KEEPHUMAN BEINGS FROM ENTERING THE CITADEL OF NATURE AND RASHLY ANDIGNORANTLY I HAD REPINED.BUT HERE WERE BOOKS AND HERE WERE MEN WHO HAD PENETRATED DEEPER AND KNEWMORE. I TOOK THEIR WORD FOR ALL THAT THEY AVERRED AND I BECAME THEIRDISCIPLE. IT MAY APPEAR STRANGE THAT SUCH SHOULD ARISE IN THE EIGHTEENTHCENTURY BUT WHILE I FOLLOWED THE ROUTINE OF EDUCATION IN THE SCHOOLS OFGENEVA I WAS TO A GREAT DEGREE SELFTAUGHT WITH REGARD TO MY FAVOURITESTUDIES. MY FATHER WAS NOT SCIENTIFIC AND I WAS LEFT TO STRUGGLE WITH ACHILDS BLINDNESS ADDED TO A STUDENTS THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE.UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF MY NEW PRECEPTORS I ENTERED WITH THE GREATESTDILIGENCE INTO THE SEARCH OF THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE AND THE ELIXIROF LIFE BUT THE LATTER SOON OBTAINED MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION. WEALTH WAS ANINFERIOR OBJECT BUT WHAT GLORY WOULD ATTEND THE DISCOVERY IF I COULDBANISH DISEASE FROM THE HUMAN FRAME AND RENDER MAN INVULNERABLE TO ANY BUTA VIOLENT DEATHNOR WERE THESE MY ONLY VISIONS. THE RAISING OF GHOSTS OR DEVILS WAS APROMISE LIBERALLY ACCORDED BY MY FAVOURITE AUTHORS THE FULFILMENT OF WHICHI MOST EAGERLY SOUGHT AND IF MY INCANTATIONS WERE ALWAYS UNSUCCESSFUL IATTRIBUTED THE FAILURE RATHER TO MY OWN INEXPERIENCE AND MISTAKE THAN TO AWANT OF SKILL OR FIDELITY IN MY INSTRUCTORS. AND THUS FOR A TIME I WASOCCUPIED BY EXPLODED SYSTEMS MINGLING LIKE AN UNADEPT A THOUSANDCONTRADICTORY THEORIES AND FLOUNDERING DESPERATELY IN A VERY SLOUGH OFMULTIFARIOUS KNOWLEDGE GUIDED BY AN ARDENT IMAGINATION AND CHILDISHREASONING TILL AN ACCIDENT AGAIN CHANGED THE CURRENT OF MY IDEAS.WHEN I WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OLD WE HAD RETIRED TO OUR HOUSE NEARBELRIVE WHEN WE WITNESSED A MOST VIOLENT AND TERRIBLE THUNDERSTORM. ITADVANCED FROM BEHIND THE MOUNTAINS OF JURA AND THE THUNDER BURST AT ONCEWITH FRIGHTFUL LOUDNESS FROM VARIOUS QUARTERS OF THE HEAVENS. I REMAINEDWHILE THE STORM LASTED WATCHING ITS PROGRESS WITH CURIOSITY AND DELIGHT.AS I STOOD AT THE DOOR ON A SUDDEN I BEHELD A STREAM OF FIRE ISSUE FROM ANOLD AND BEAUTIFUL OAK WHICH STOOD ABOUT TWENTY YARDS FROM OUR HOUSE AND SOSOON AS THE DAZZLING LIGHT VANISHED THE OAK HAD DISAPPEARED AND NOTHINGREMAINED BUT A BLASTED STUMP. WHEN WE VISITED IT THE NEXT MORNING WE FOUNDTHE TREE SHATTERED IN A SINGULAR MANNER. IT WAS NOT SPLINTERED BY THESHOCK BUT ENTIRELY REDUCED TO THIN RIBBONS OF WOOD. I NEVER BEHELDANYTHING SO UTTERLY DESTROYED.BEFORE THIS I WAS NOT UNACQUAINTED WITH THE MORE OBVIOUS LAWS OFELECTRICITY. ON THIS OCCASION A MAN OF GREAT RESEARCH IN NATURALPHILOSOPHY WAS WITH US AND EXCITED BY THIS CATASTROPHE HE ENTERED ONTHE EXPLANATION OF A THEORY WHICH HE HAD FORMED ON THE SUBJECT OFELECTRICITY AND GALVANISM WHICH WAS AT ONCE NEW AND ASTONISHING TO ME.ALL THAT HE SAID THREW GREATLY INTO THE SHADE CORNELIUS AGRIPPAALBERTUS MAGNUS AND PARACELSUS THE LORDS OF MY IMAGINATION BUT BYSOME FATALITY THE OVERTHROW OF THESE MEN DISINCLINED ME TO PURSUE MYACCUSTOMED STUDIES. IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF NOTHING WOULD OR COULD EVERBE KNOWN. ALL THAT HAD SO LONG ENGAGED MY ATTENTION SUDDENLY GREWDESPICABLE. BY ONE OF THOSE CAPRICES OF THE MIND WHICH WE ARE PERHAPSMOST SUBJECT TO IN EARLY YOUTH I AT ONCE GAVE UP MY FORMEROCCUPATIONS SET DOWN NATURAL HISTORY AND ALL ITS PROGENY AS A DEFORMEDAND ABORTIVE CREATION AND ENTERTAINED THE GREATEST DISDAIN FOR AWOULDBE SCIENCE WHICH COULD NEVER EVEN STEP WITHIN THE THRESHOLD OFREAL KNOWLEDGE. IN THIS MOOD OF MIND I BETOOK MYSELF TO THEMATHEMATICS AND THE BRANCHES OF STUDY APPERTAINING TO THAT SCIENCE ASBEING BUILT UPON SECURE FOUNDATIONS AND SO WORTHY OF MY CONSIDERATION.THUS STRANGELY ARE OUR SOULS CONSTRUCTED AND BY SUCH SLIGHT LIGAMENTSARE WE BOUND TO PROSPERITY OR RUIN. WHEN I LOOK BACK IT SEEMS TO MEAS IF THIS ALMOST MIRACULOUS CHANGE OF INCLINATION AND WILL WAS THEIMMEDIATE SUGGESTION OF THE GUARDIAN ANGEL OF MY LIFETHE LAST EFFORTMADE BY THE SPIRIT OF PRESERVATION TO AVERT THE STORM THAT WAS EVENTHEN HANGING IN THE STARS AND READY TO ENVELOP ME. HER VICTORY WASANNOUNCED BY AN UNUSUAL TRANQUILLITY AND GLADNESS OF SOUL WHICHFOLLOWED THE RELINQUISHING OF MY ANCIENT AND LATTERLY TORMENTINGSTUDIES. IT WAS THUS THAT I WAS TO BE TAUGHT TO ASSOCIATE EVIL WITHTHEIR PROSECUTION HAPPINESS WITH THEIR DISREGARD.IT WAS A STRONG EFFORT OF THE SPIRIT OF GOOD BUT IT WAS INEFFECTUAL.DESTINY WAS TOO POTENT AND HER IMMUTABLE LAWS HAD DECREED MY UTTER ANDTERRIBLE DESTRUCTION.CHAPTER WHEN I HAD ATTAINED THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN MY PARENTS RESOLVED THAT ISHOULD BECOME A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF INGOLSTADT. I HADHITHERTO ATTENDED THE SCHOOLS OF GENEVA BUT MY FATHER THOUGHT ITNECESSARY FOR THE COMPLETION OF MY EDUCATION THAT I SHOULD BE MADEACQUAINTED WITH OTHER CUSTOMS THAN THOSE OF MY NATIVE COUNTRY. MYDEPARTURE WAS THEREFORE FIXED AT AN EARLY DATE BUT BEFORE THE DAYRESOLVED UPON COULD ARRIVE THE FIRST MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFEOCCURREDAN OMEN AS IT WERE OF MY FUTURE MISERY.ELIZABETH HAD CAUGHT THE SCARLET FEVER HER ILLNESS WAS SEVERE AND SHE WASIN THE GREATEST DANGER. DURING HER ILLNESS MANY ARGUMENTS HAD BEEN URGED TOPERSUADE MY MOTHER TO REFRAIN FROM ATTENDING UPON HER. SHE HAD AT FIRSTYIELDED TO OUR ENTREATIES BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THAT THE LIFE OF HERFAVOURITE WAS MENACED SHE COULD NO LONGER CONTROL HER ANXIETY. SHEATTENDED HER SICKBED HER WATCHFUL ATTENTIONS TRIUMPHED OVER THE MALIGNITYOF THE DISTEMPERELIZABETH WAS SAVED BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THISIMPRUDENCE WERE FATAL TO HER PRESERVER. ON THE THIRD DAY MY MOTHERSICKENED HER FEVER WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE MOST ALARMING SYMPTOMS AND THELOOKS OF HER MEDICAL ATTENDANTS PROGNOSTICATED THE WORST EVENT. ON HERDEATHBED THE FORTITUDE AND BENIGNITY OF THIS BEST OF WOMEN DID NOT DESERTHER. SHE JOINED THE HANDS OF ELIZABETH AND MYSELF. MYCHILDREN SHE SAID MY FIRMEST HOPES OF FUTURE HAPPINESS WEREPLACED ON THE PROSPECT OF YOUR UNION. THIS EXPECTATION WILL NOW BE THECONSOLATION OF YOUR FATHER. ELIZABETH MY LOVE YOU MUST SUPPLY MY PLACE TOMY YOUNGER CHILDREN. ALAS I REGRET THAT I AM TAKEN FROM YOU AND HAPPYAND BELOVED AS I HAVE BEEN IS IT NOT HARD TO QUIT YOU ALL BUT THESE ARENOT THOUGHTS BEFITTING ME I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO RESIGN MYSELF CHEERFULLY TODEATH AND WILL INDULGE A HOPE OF MEETING YOU IN ANOTHER WORLD.SHE DIED CALMLY AND HER COUNTENANCE EXPRESSED AFFECTION EVEN IN DEATH.I NEED NOT DESCRIBE THE FEELINGS OF THOSE WHOSE DEAREST TIES ARE RENTBY THAT MOST IRREPARABLE EVIL THE VOID THAT PRESENTS ITSELF TO THESOUL AND THE DESPAIR THAT IS EXHIBITED ON THE COUNTENANCE. IT IS SOLONG BEFORE THE MIND CAN PERSUADE ITSELF THAT SHE WHOM WE SAW EVERY DAYAND WHOSE VERY EXISTENCE APPEARED A PART OF OUR OWN CAN HAVE DEPARTEDFOR EVERTHAT THE BRIGHTNESS OF A BELOVED EYE CAN HAVE BEENEXTINGUISHED AND THE SOUND OF A VOICE SO FAMILIAR AND DEAR TO THE EARCAN BE HUSHED NEVER MORE TO BE HEARD. THESE ARE THE REFLECTIONS OFTHE FIRST DAYS BUT WHEN THE LAPSE OF TIME PROVES THE REALITY OF THEEVIL THEN THE ACTUAL BITTERNESS OF GRIEF COMMENCES. YET FROM WHOM HASNOT THAT RUDE HAND RENT AWAY SOME DEAR CONNECTION AND WHY SHOULD IDESCRIBE A SORROW WHICH ALL HAVE FELT AND MUST FEEL THE TIME ATLENGTH ARRIVES WHEN GRIEF IS RATHER AN INDULGENCE THAN A NECESSITY ANDTHE SMILE THAT PLAYS UPON THE LIPS ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE DEEMED ASACRILEGE IS NOT BANISHED. MY MOTHER WAS DEAD BUT WE HAD STILLDUTIES WHICH WE OUGHT TO PERFORM WE MUST CONTINUE OUR COURSE WITH THEREST AND LEARN TO THINK OURSELVES FORTUNATE WHILST ONE REMAINS WHOM THESPOILER HAS NOT SEIZED.MY DEPARTURE FOR INGOLSTADT WHICH HAD BEEN DEFERRED BY THESE EVENTSWAS NOW AGAIN DETERMINED UPON. I OBTAINED FROM MY FATHER A RESPITE OFSOME WEEKS. IT APPEARED TO ME SACRILEGE SO SOON TO LEAVE THE REPOSEAKIN TO DEATH OF THE HOUSE OF MOURNING AND TO RUSH INTO THE THICK OFLIFE. I WAS NEW TO SORROW BUT IT DID NOT THE LESS ALARM ME. I WASUNWILLING TO QUIT THE SIGHT OF THOSE THAT REMAINED TO ME AND ABOVEALL I DESIRED TO SEE MY SWEET ELIZABETH IN SOME DEGREE CONSOLED.SHE INDEED VEILED HER GRIEF AND STROVE TO ACT THE COMFORTER TO US ALL.SHE LOOKED STEADILY ON LIFE AND ASSUMED ITS DUTIES WITH COURAGE ANDZEAL. SHE DEVOTED HERSELF TO THOSE WHOM SHE HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO CALLHER UNCLE AND COUSINS. NEVER WAS SHE SO ENCHANTING AS AT THIS TIMEWHEN SHE RECALLED THE SUNSHINE OF HER SMILES AND SPENT THEM UPON US.SHE FORGOT EVEN HER OWN REGRET IN HER ENDEAVOURS TO MAKE US FORGET.THE DAY OF MY DEPARTURE AT LENGTH ARRIVED. CLERVAL SPENT THE LASTEVENING WITH US. HE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO PERSUADE HIS FATHER TO PERMITHIM TO ACCOMPANY ME AND TO BECOME MY FELLOW STUDENT BUT IN VAIN. HISFATHER WAS A NARROWMINDED TRADER AND SAW IDLENESS AND RUIN IN THEASPIRATIONS AND AMBITION OF HIS SON. HENRY DEEPLY FELT THE MISFORTUNEOF BEING DEBARRED FROM A LIBERAL EDUCATION. HE SAID LITTLE BUT WHENHE SPOKE I READ IN HIS KINDLING EYE AND IN HIS ANIMATED GLANCE ARESTRAINED BUT FIRM RESOLVE NOT TO BE CHAINED TO THE MISERABLE DETAILSOF COMMERCE.WE SAT LATE. WE COULD NOT TEAR OURSELVES AWAY FROM EACH OTHER NORPERSUADE OURSELVES TO SAY THE WORD FAREWELL IT WAS SAID AND WERETIRED UNDER THE PRETENCE OF SEEKING REPOSE EACH FANCYING THAT THEOTHER WAS DECEIVED BUT WHEN AT MORNINGS DAWN I DESCENDED TO THECARRIAGE WHICH WAS TO CONVEY ME AWAY THEY WERE ALL THEREMY FATHERAGAIN TO BLESS ME CLERVAL TO PRESS MY HAND ONCE MORE MY ELIZABETH TORENEW HER ENTREATIES THAT I WOULD WRITE OFTEN AND TO BESTOW THE LASTFEMININE ATTENTIONS ON HER PLAYMATE AND FRIEND.I THREW MYSELF INTO THE CHAISE THAT WAS TO CONVEY ME AWAY AND INDULGED INTHE MOST MELANCHOLY REFLECTIONS. I WHO HAD EVER BEEN SURROUNDED BYAMIABLE COMPANIONS CONTINUALLY ENGAGED IN ENDEAVOURING TO BESTOW MUTUALPLEASUREI WAS NOW ALONE. IN THE UNIVERSITY WHITHER I WAS GOING IMUST FORM MY OWN FRIENDS AND BE MY OWN PROTECTOR. MY LIFE HAD HITHERTOBEEN REMARKABLY SECLUDED AND DOMESTIC AND THIS HAD GIVEN ME INVINCIBLEREPUGNANCE TO NEW COUNTENANCES. I LOVED MY BROTHERS ELIZABETH ANDCLERVAL THESE WERE OLD FAMILIAR FACES BUT I BELIEVED MYSELFTOTALLY UNFITTED FOR THE COMPANY OF STRANGERS. SUCH WERE MY REFLECTIONS ASI COMMENCED MY JOURNEY BUT AS I PROCEEDED MY SPIRITS AND HOPES ROSE. IARDENTLY DESIRED THE ACQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE. I HAD OFTEN WHEN AT HOMETHOUGHT IT HARD TO REMAIN DURING MY YOUTH COOPED UP IN ONE PLACE AND HADLONGED TO ENTER THE WORLD AND TAKE MY STATION AMONG OTHER HUMAN BEINGS. NOW MY DESIRES WERE COMPLIED WITH AND IT WOULD INDEED HAVE BEEN FOLLY TOREPENT.I HAD SUFFICIENT LEISURE FOR THESE AND MANY OTHER REFLECTIONS DURING MYJOURNEY TO INGOLSTADT WHICH WAS LONG AND FATIGUING. AT LENGTH THEHIGH WHITE STEEPLE OF THE TOWN MET MY EYES. I ALIGHTED AND WASCONDUCTED TO MY SOLITARY APARTMENT TO SPEND THE EVENING AS I PLEASED.THE NEXT MORNING I DELIVERED MY LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION AND PAID A VISIT TOSOME OF THE PRINCIPAL PROFESSORS. CHANCEOR RATHER THE EVILINFLUENCE THE ANGEL OF DESTRUCTION WHICH ASSERTED OMNIPOTENT SWAY OVER MEFROM THE MOMENT I TURNED MY RELUCTANT STEPS FROM MY FATHERSDOORLED ME FIRST TO M. KREMPE PROFESSOR OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. HEWAS AN UNCOUTH MAN BUT DEEPLY IMBUED IN THE SECRETS OF HIS SCIENCE. HEASKED ME SEVERAL QUESTIONS CONCERNING MY PROGRESS IN THE DIFFERENT BRANCHESOF SCIENCE APPERTAINING TO NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. I REPLIED CARELESSLY ANDPARTLY IN CONTEMPT MENTIONED THE NAMES OF MY ALCHEMISTS AS THE PRINCIPALAUTHORS I HAD STUDIED. THE PROFESSOR STARED. HAVE YOU HESAID REALLY SPENT YOUR TIME IN STUDYING SUCH NONSENSEI REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. EVERY MINUTE CONTINUED M. KREMPE WITHWARMTH EVERY INSTANT THAT YOU HAVE WASTED ON THOSE BOOKS IS UTTERLYAND ENTIRELY LOST. YOU HAVE BURDENED YOUR MEMORY WITH EXPLODED SYSTEMSAND USELESS NAMES. GOOD GOD IN WHAT DESERT LAND HAVE YOU LIVEDWHERE NO ONE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO INFORM YOU THAT THESE FANCIES WHICH YOUHAVE SO GREEDILY IMBIBED ARE A THOUSAND YEARS OLD AND AS MUSTY AS THEYARE ANCIENT I LITTLE EXPECTED IN THIS ENLIGHTENED AND SCIENTIFICAGE TO FIND A DISCIPLE OF ALBERTUS MAGNUS AND PARACELSUS. MY DEARSIR YOU MUST BEGIN YOUR STUDIES ENTIRELY ANEW.SO SAYING HE STEPPED ASIDE AND WROTE DOWN A LIST OF SEVERAL BOOKSTREATING OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY WHICH HE DESIRED ME TO PROCURE ANDDISMISSED ME AFTER MENTIONING THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FOLLOWINGWEEK HE INTENDED TO COMMENCE A COURSE OF LECTURES UPON NATURALPHILOSOPHY IN ITS GENERAL RELATIONS AND THAT M. WALDMAN A FELLOWPROFESSOR WOULD LECTURE UPON CHEMISTRY THE ALTERNATE DAYS THAT HEOMITTED.I RETURNED HOME NOT DISAPPOINTED FOR I HAVE SAID THAT I HAD LONGCONSIDERED THOSE AUTHORS USELESS WHOM THE PROFESSOR REPROBATED BUT IRETURNED NOT AT ALL THE MORE INCLINED TO RECUR TO THESE STUDIES IN ANYSHAPE. M. KREMPE WAS A LITTLE SQUAT MAN WITH A GRUFF VOICE AND AREPULSIVE COUNTENANCE THE TEACHER THEREFORE DID NOT PREPOSSESS ME INFAVOUR OF HIS PURSUITS. IN RATHER A TOO PHILOSOPHICAL AND CONNECTED ASTRAIN PERHAPS I HAVE GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONCLUSIONS I HAD COMETO CONCERNING THEM IN MY EARLY YEARS. AS A CHILD I HAD NOT BEENCONTENT WITH THE RESULTS PROMISED BY THE MODERN PROFESSORS OF NATURALSCIENCE. WITH A CONFUSION OF IDEAS ONLY TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY MYEXTREME YOUTH AND MY WANT OF A GUIDE ON SUCH MATTERS I HAD RETROD THESTEPS OF KNOWLEDGE ALONG THE PATHS OF TIME AND EXCHANGED THEDISCOVERIES OF RECENT INQUIRERS FOR THE DREAMS OF FORGOTTEN ALCHEMISTS.BESIDES I HAD A CONTEMPT FOR THE USES OF MODERN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT WHEN THE MASTERS OF THE SCIENCE SOUGHTIMMORTALITY AND POWER SUCH VIEWS ALTHOUGH FUTILE WERE GRAND BUT NOWTHE SCENE WAS CHANGED. THE AMBITION OF THE INQUIRER SEEMED TO LIMITITSELF TO THE ANNIHILATION OF THOSE VISIONS ON WHICH MY INTEREST INSCIENCE WAS CHIEFLY FOUNDED. I WAS REQUIRED TO EXCHANGE CHIMERAS OFBOUNDLESS GRANDEUR FOR REALITIES OF LITTLE WORTH.SUCH WERE MY REFLECTIONS DURING THE FIRST TWO OR THREE DAYS OF MYRESIDENCE AT INGOLSTADT WHICH WERE CHIEFLY SPENT IN BECOMINGACQUAINTED WITH THE LOCALITIES AND THE PRINCIPAL RESIDENTS IN MY NEWABODE. BUT AS THE ENSUING WEEK COMMENCED I THOUGHT OF THE INFORMATIONWHICH M. KREMPE HAD GIVEN ME CONCERNING THE LECTURES. AND ALTHOUGH ICOULD NOT CONSENT TO GO AND HEAR THAT LITTLE CONCEITED FELLOW DELIVERSENTENCES OUT OF A PULPIT I RECOLLECTED WHAT HE HAD SAID OF M.WALDMAN WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN AS HE HAD HITHERTO BEEN OUT OF TOWN.PARTLY FROM CURIOSITY AND PARTLY FROM IDLENESS I WENT INTO THE LECTURINGROOM WHICH M. WALDMAN ENTERED SHORTLY AFTER. THIS PROFESSOR WAS VERYUNLIKE HIS COLLEAGUE. HE APPEARED ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE BUT WITH ANASPECT EXPRESSIVE OF THE GREATEST BENEVOLENCE A FEW GREY HAIRS COVERED HISTEMPLES BUT THOSE AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD WERE NEARLY BLACK. HIS PERSONWAS SHORT BUT REMARKABLY ERECT AND HIS VOICE THE SWEETEST I HAD EVER HEARD.HE BEGAN HIS LECTURE BY A RECAPITULATION OF THE HISTORY OF CHEMISTRY ANDTHE VARIOUS IMPROVEMENTS MADE BY DIFFERENT MEN OF LEARNING PRONOUNCINGWITH FERVOUR THE NAMES OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED DISCOVERERS. HE THEN TOOKA CURSORY VIEW OF THE PRESENT STATE OF THE SCIENCE AND EXPLAINED MANY OFITS ELEMENTARY TERMS. AFTER HAVING MADE A FEW PREPARATORY EXPERIMENTS HECONCLUDED WITH A PANEGYRIC UPON MODERN CHEMISTRY THE TERMS OF WHICH ISHALL NEVER FORGETTHE ANCIENT TEACHERS OF THIS SCIENCE SAID HEPROMISED IMPOSSIBILITIES AND PERFORMED NOTHING. THE MODERN MASTERSPROMISE VERY LITTLE THEY KNOW THAT METALS CANNOT BE TRANSMUTED AND THATTHE ELIXIR OF LIFE IS A CHIMERA BUT THESE PHILOSOPHERS WHOSE HANDS SEEMONLY MADE TO DABBLE IN DIRT AND THEIR EYES TO PORE OVER THE MICROSCOPE ORCRUCIBLE HAVE INDEED PERFORMED MIRACLES. THEY PENETRATE INTO THE RECESSESOF NATURE AND SHOW HOW SHE WORKS IN HER HIDINGPLACES. THEY ASCEND INTO THEHEAVENS THEY HAVE DISCOVERED HOW THE BLOOD CIRCULATES AND THE NATURE OFTHE AIR WE BREATHE. THEY HAVE ACQUIRED NEW AND ALMOST UNLIMITED POWERSTHEY CAN COMMAND THE THUNDERS OF HEAVEN MIMIC THE EARTHQUAKE AND EVENMOCK THE INVISIBLE WORLD WITH ITS OWN SHADOWS.SUCH WERE THE PROFESSORS WORDSRATHER LET ME SAY SUCH THE WORDS OFTHE FATEENOUNCED TO DESTROY ME. AS HE WENT ON I FELT AS IF MY SOULWERE GRAPPLING WITH A PALPABLE ENEMY ONE BY ONE THE VARIOUS KEYS WERETOUCHED WHICH FORMED THE MECHANISM OF MY BEING CHORD AFTER CHORD WASSOUNDED AND SOON MY MIND WAS FILLED WITH ONE THOUGHT ONE CONCEPTIONONE PURPOSE. SO MUCH HAS BEEN DONE EXCLAIMED THE SOUL OFFRANKENSTEINMORE FAR MORE WILL I ACHIEVE TREADING IN THE STEPSALREADY MARKED I WILL PIONEER A NEW WAY EXPLORE UNKNOWN POWERS ANDUNFOLD TO THE WORLD THE DEEPEST MYSTERIES OF CREATION.I CLOSED NOT MY EYES THAT NIGHT. MY INTERNAL BEING WAS IN A STATE OFINSURRECTION AND TURMOIL I FELT THAT ORDER WOULD THENCE ARISE BUT IHAD NO POWER TO PRODUCE IT. BY DEGREES AFTER THE MORNINGS DAWNSLEEP CAME. I AWOKE AND MY YESTERNIGHTS THOUGHTS WERE AS A DREAM.THERE ONLY REMAINED A RESOLUTION TO RETURN TO MY ANCIENT STUDIES AND TODEVOTE MYSELF TO A SCIENCE FOR WHICH I BELIEVED MYSELF TO POSSESS ANATURAL TALENT. ON THE SAME DAY I PAID M. WALDMAN A VISIT. HISMANNERS IN PRIVATE WERE EVEN MORE MILD AND ATTRACTIVE THAN IN PUBLICFOR THERE WAS A CERTAIN DIGNITY IN HIS MIEN DURING HIS LECTURE WHICH INHIS OWN HOUSE WAS REPLACED BY THE GREATEST AFFABILITY AND KINDNESS. IGAVE HIM PRETTY NEARLY THE SAME ACCOUNT OF MY FORMER PURSUITS AS I HADGIVEN TO HIS FELLOW PROFESSOR. HE HEARD WITH ATTENTION THE LITTLENARRATION CONCERNING MY STUDIES AND SMILED AT THE NAMES OF CORNELIUSAGRIPPA AND PARACELSUS BUT WITHOUT THE CONTEMPT THAT M. KREMPE HADEXHIBITED. HE SAID THAT THESE WERE MEN TO WHOSE INDEFATIGABLE ZEALMODERN PHILOSOPHERS WERE INDEBTED FOR MOST OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF THEIRKNOWLEDGE. THEY HAD LEFT TO US AS AN EASIER TASK TO GIVE NEW NAMESAND ARRANGE IN CONNECTED CLASSIFICATIONS THE FACTS WHICH THEY IN AGREAT DEGREE HAD BEEN THE INSTRUMENTS OF BRINGING TO LIGHT. THELABOURS OF MEN OF GENIUS HOWEVER ERRONEOUSLY DIRECTED SCARCELY EVERFAIL IN ULTIMATELY TURNING TO THE SOLID ADVANTAGE OF MANKIND. ILISTENED TO HIS STATEMENT WHICH WAS DELIVERED WITHOUT ANY PRESUMPTIONOR AFFECTATION AND THEN ADDED THAT HIS LECTURE HAD REMOVED MYPREJUDICES AGAINST MODERN CHEMISTS I EXPRESSED MYSELF IN MEASUREDTERMS WITH THE MODESTY AND DEFERENCE DUE FROM A YOUTH TO HISINSTRUCTOR WITHOUT LETTING ESCAPE INEXPERIENCE IN LIFE WOULD HAVEMADE ME ASHAMED ANY OF THE ENTHUSIASM WHICH STIMULATED MY INTENDEDLABOURS. I REQUESTED HIS ADVICE CONCERNING THE BOOKS I OUGHT TOPROCURE.I AM HAPPY SAID M. WALDMAN TO HAVE GAINED ADISCIPLE AND IF YOUR APPLICATION EQUALS YOUR ABILITY I HAVE NO DOUBT OFYOUR SUCCESS. CHEMISTRY IS THAT BRANCH OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IN WHICH THEGREATEST IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE MADE IT IS ON THAT ACCOUNT THATI HAVE MADE IT MY PECULIAR STUDY BUT AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE NOTNEGLECTED THE OTHER BRANCHES OF SCIENCE. A MAN WOULD MAKE BUT A VERY SORRYCHEMIST IF HE ATTENDED TO THAT DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE ALONE. IF YOURWISH IS TO BECOME REALLY A MAN OF SCIENCE AND NOT MERELY A PETTYEXPERIMENTALIST I SHOULD ADVISE YOU TO APPLY TO EVERY BRANCH OF NATURALPHILOSOPHY INCLUDING MATHEMATICS.HE THEN TOOK ME INTO HIS LABORATORY AND EXPLAINED TO ME THE USES OF HISVARIOUS MACHINES INSTRUCTING ME AS TO WHAT I OUGHT TO PROCURE ANDPROMISING ME THE USE OF HIS OWN WHEN I SHOULD HAVE ADVANCED FAR ENOUGH INTHE SCIENCE NOT TO DERANGE THEIR MECHANISM. HE ALSO GAVE ME THE LIST OFBOOKS WHICH I HAD REQUESTED AND I TOOK MY LEAVE.THUS ENDED A DAY MEMORABLE TO ME IT DECIDED MY FUTURE DESTINY.CHAPTER FROM THIS DAY NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AND PARTICULARLY CHEMISTRY IN THEMOST COMPREHENSIVE SENSE OF THE TERM BECAME NEARLY MY SOLE OCCUPATION.I READ WITH ARDOUR THOSE WORKS SO FULL OF GENIUS AND DISCRIMINATIONWHICH MODERN INQUIRERS HAVE WRITTEN ON THESE SUBJECTS. I ATTENDED THELECTURES AND CULTIVATED THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE MEN OF SCIENCE OF THEUNIVERSITY AND I FOUND EVEN IN M. KREMPE A GREAT DEAL OF SOUND SENSEAND REAL INFORMATION COMBINED IT IS TRUE WITH A REPULSIVEPHYSIOGNOMY AND MANNERS BUT NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT THE LESS VALUABLE. INM. WALDMAN I FOUND A TRUE FRIEND. HIS GENTLENESS WAS NEVER TINGED BYDOGMATISM AND HIS INSTRUCTIONS WERE GIVEN WITH AN AIR OF FRANKNESS ANDGOOD NATURE THAT BANISHED EVERY IDEA OF PEDANTRY. IN A THOUSAND WAYSHE SMOOTHED FOR ME THE PATH OF KNOWLEDGE AND MADE THE MOST ABSTRUSEINQUIRIES CLEAR AND FACILE TO MY APPREHENSION. MY APPLICATION WAS ATFIRST FLUCTUATING AND UNCERTAIN IT GAINED STRENGTH AS I PROCEEDED ANDSOON BECAME SO ARDENT AND EAGER THAT THE STARS OFTEN DISAPPEARED IN THELIGHT OF MORNING WHILST I WAS YET ENGAGED IN MY LABORATORY.AS I APPLIED SO CLOSELY IT MAY BE EASILY CONCEIVED THAT MY PROGRESSWAS RAPID. MY ARDOUR WAS INDEED THE ASTONISHMENT OF THE STUDENTS ANDMY PROFICIENCY THAT OF THE MASTERS. PROFESSOR KREMPE OFTEN ASKED MEWITH A SLY SMILE HOW CORNELIUS AGRIPPA WENT ON WHILST M. WALDMANEXPRESSED THE MOST HEARTFELT EXULTATION IN MY PROGRESS. TWO YEARSPASSED IN THIS MANNER DURING WHICH I PAID NO VISIT TO GENEVA BUT WASENGAGED HEART AND SOUL IN THE PURSUIT OF SOME DISCOVERIES WHICH IHOPED TO MAKE. NONE BUT THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THEM CAN CONCEIVEOF THE ENTICEMENTS OF SCIENCE. IN OTHER STUDIES YOU GO AS FAR ASOTHERS HAVE GONE BEFORE YOU AND THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO KNOW BUT INA SCIENTIFIC PURSUIT THERE IS CONTINUAL FOOD FOR DISCOVERY AND WONDER.A MIND OF MODERATE CAPACITY WHICH CLOSELY PURSUES ONE STUDY MUSTINFALLIBLY ARRIVE AT GREAT PROFICIENCY IN THAT STUDY AND I WHOCONTINUALLY SOUGHT THE ATTAINMENT OF ONE OBJECT OF PURSUIT AND WASSOLELY WRAPPED UP IN THIS IMPROVED SO RAPIDLY THAT AT THE END OF TWOYEARS I MADE SOME DISCOVERIES IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF SOME CHEMICALINSTRUMENTS WHICH PROCURED ME GREAT ESTEEM AND ADMIRATION AT THEUNIVERSITY. WHEN I HAD ARRIVED AT THIS POINT AND HAD BECOME AS WELLACQUAINTED WITH THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY ASDEPENDED ON THE LESSONS OF ANY OF THE PROFESSORS AT INGOLSTADT MYRESIDENCE THERE BEING NO LONGER CONDUCIVE TO MY IMPROVEMENTS I THOUGHTOF RETURNING TO MY FRIENDS AND MY NATIVE TOWN WHEN AN INCIDENTHAPPENED THAT PROTRACTED MY STAY.ONE OF THE PHENOMENA WHICH HAD PECULIARLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION WASTHE STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN FRAME AND INDEED ANY ANIMAL ENDUED WITHLIFE. WHENCE I OFTEN ASKED MYSELF DID THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE PROCEEDIT WAS A BOLD QUESTION AND ONE WHICH HAS EVER BEEN CONSIDERED AS AMYSTERY YET WITH HOW MANY THINGS ARE WE UPON THE BRINK OF BECOMINGACQUAINTED IF COWARDICE OR CARELESSNESS DID NOT RESTRAIN OURINQUIRIES. I REVOLVED THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IN MY MIND AND DETERMINEDTHENCEFORTH TO APPLY MYSELF MORE PARTICULARLY TO THOSE BRANCHES OFNATURAL PHILOSOPHY WHICH RELATE TO PHYSIOLOGY. UNLESS I HAD BEENANIMATED BY AN ALMOST SUPERNATURAL ENTHUSIASM MY APPLICATION TO THISSTUDY WOULD HAVE BEEN IRKSOME AND ALMOST INTOLERABLE. TO EXAMINE THECAUSES OF LIFE WE MUST FIRST HAVE RECOURSE TO DEATH. I BECAMEACQUAINTED WITH THE SCIENCE OF ANATOMY BUT THIS WAS NOT SUFFICIENT IMUST ALSO OBSERVE THE NATURAL DECAY AND CORRUPTION OF THE HUMAN BODY.IN MY EDUCATION MY FATHER HAD TAKEN THE GREATEST PRECAUTIONS THAT MYMIND SHOULD BE IMPRESSED WITH NO SUPERNATURAL HORRORS. I DO NOT EVERREMEMBER TO HAVE TREMBLED AT A TALE OF SUPERSTITION OR TO HAVE FEAREDTHE APPARITION OF A SPIRIT. DARKNESS HAD NO EFFECT UPON MY FANCY ANDA CHURCHYARD WAS TO ME MERELY THE RECEPTACLE OF BODIES DEPRIVED OFLIFE WHICH FROM BEING THE SEAT OF BEAUTY AND STRENGTH HAD BECOMEFOOD FOR THE WORM. NOW I WAS LED TO EXAMINE THE CAUSE AND PROGRESS OFTHIS DECAY AND FORCED TO SPEND DAYS AND NIGHTS IN VAULTS ANDCHARNELHOUSES. MY ATTENTION WAS FIXED UPON EVERY OBJECT THE MOSTINSUPPORTABLE TO THE DELICACY OF THE HUMAN FEELINGS. I SAW HOW THEFINE FORM OF MAN WAS DEGRADED AND WASTED I BEHELD THE CORRUPTION OFDEATH SUCCEED TO THE BLOOMING CHEEK OF LIFE I SAW HOW THE WORMINHERITED THE WONDERS OF THE EYE AND BRAIN. I PAUSED EXAMINING ANDANALYSING ALL THE MINUTIAE OF CAUSATION AS EXEMPLIFIED IN THE CHANGEFROM LIFE TO DEATH AND DEATH TO LIFE UNTIL FROM THE MIDST OF THISDARKNESS A SUDDEN LIGHT BROKE IN UPON MEA LIGHT SO BRILLIANT ANDWONDROUS YET SO SIMPLE THAT WHILE I BECAME DIZZY WITH THE IMMENSITYOF THE PROSPECT WHICH IT ILLUSTRATED I WAS SURPRISED THAT AMONG SOMANY MEN OF GENIUS WHO HAD DIRECTED THEIR INQUIRIES TOWARDS THE SAMESCIENCE THAT I ALONE SHOULD BE RESERVED TO DISCOVER SO ASTONISHING ASECRET.REMEMBER I AM NOT RECORDING THE VISION OF A MADMAN. THE SUN DOES NOTMORE CERTAINLY SHINE IN THE HEAVENS THAN THAT WHICH I NOW AFFIRM ISTRUE. SOME MIRACLE MIGHT HAVE PRODUCED IT YET THE STAGES OF THEDISCOVERY WERE DISTINCT AND PROBABLE. AFTER DAYS AND NIGHTS OFINCREDIBLE LABOUR AND FATIGUE I SUCCEEDED IN DISCOVERING THE CAUSE OFGENERATION AND LIFE NAY MORE I BECAME MYSELF CAPABLE OF BESTOWINGANIMATION UPON LIFELESS MATTER.THE ASTONISHMENT WHICH I HAD AT FIRST EXPERIENCED ON THIS DISCOVERYSOON GAVE PLACE TO DELIGHT AND RAPTURE. AFTER SO MUCH TIME SPENT INPAINFUL LABOUR TO ARRIVE AT ONCE AT THE SUMMIT OF MY DESIRES WAS THEMOST GRATIFYING CONSUMMATION OF MY TOILS. BUT THIS DISCOVERY WAS SOGREAT AND OVERWHELMING THAT ALL THE STEPS BY WHICH I HAD BEENPROGRESSIVELY LED TO IT WERE OBLITERATED AND I BEHELD ONLY THE RESULT.WHAT HAD BEEN THE STUDY AND DESIRE OF THE WISEST MEN SINCE THE CREATIONOF THE WORLD WAS NOW WITHIN MY GRASP. NOT THAT LIKE A MAGIC SCENE ITALL OPENED UPON ME AT ONCE THE INFORMATION I HAD OBTAINED WAS OF ANATURE RATHER TO DIRECT MY ENDEAVOURS SO SOON AS I SHOULD POINT THEMTOWARDS THE OBJECT OF MY SEARCH THAN TO EXHIBIT THAT OBJECT ALREADYACCOMPLISHED. I WAS LIKE THE ARABIAN WHO HAD BEEN BURIED WITH THE DEADAND FOUND A PASSAGE TO LIFE AIDED ONLY BY ONE GLIMMERING AND SEEMINGLYINEFFECTUAL LIGHT.I SEE BY YOUR EAGERNESS AND THE WONDER AND HOPE WHICH YOUR EYESEXPRESS MY FRIEND THAT YOU EXPECT TO BE INFORMED OF THE SECRET WITHWHICH I AM ACQUAINTED THAT CANNOT BE LISTEN PATIENTLY UNTIL THE ENDOF MY STORY AND YOU WILL EASILY PERCEIVE WHY I AM RESERVED UPON THATSUBJECT. I WILL NOT LEAD YOU ON UNGUARDED AND ARDENT AS I THEN WASTO YOUR DESTRUCTION AND INFALLIBLE MISERY. LEARN FROM ME IF NOT BY MYPRECEPTS AT LEAST BY MY EXAMPLE HOW DANGEROUS IS THE ACQUIREMENT OFKNOWLEDGE AND HOW MUCH HAPPIER THAT MAN IS WHO BELIEVES HIS NATIVE TOWNTO BE THE WORLD THAN HE WHO ASPIRES TO BECOME GREATER THAN HIS NATUREWILL ALLOW.WHEN I FOUND SO ASTONISHING A POWER PLACED WITHIN MY HANDS I HESITATEDA LONG TIME CONCERNING THE MANNER IN WHICH I SHOULD EMPLOY IT.ALTHOUGH I POSSESSED THE CAPACITY OF BESTOWING ANIMATION YET TOPREPARE A FRAME FOR THE RECEPTION OF IT WITH ALL ITS INTRICACIES OFFIBRES MUSCLES AND VEINS STILL REMAINED A WORK OF INCONCEIVABLEDIFFICULTY AND LABOUR. I DOUBTED AT FIRST WHETHER I SHOULD ATTEMPT THECREATION OF A BEING LIKE MYSELF OR ONE OF SIMPLER ORGANIZATION BUT MYIMAGINATION WAS TOO MUCH EXALTED BY MY FIRST SUCCESS TO PERMIT ME TODOUBT OF MY ABILITY TO GIVE LIFE TO AN ANIMAL AS COMPLEX AND WONDERFULAS MAN. THE MATERIALS AT PRESENT WITHIN MY COMMAND HARDLY APPEAREDADEQUATE TO SO ARDUOUS AN UNDERTAKING BUT I DOUBTED NOT THAT I SHOULDULTIMATELY SUCCEED. I PREPARED MYSELF FOR A MULTITUDE OF REVERSES MYOPERATIONS MIGHT BE INCESSANTLY BAFFLED AND AT LAST MY WORK BEIMPERFECT YET WHEN I CONSIDERED THE IMPROVEMENT WHICH EVERY DAY TAKESPLACE IN SCIENCE AND MECHANICS I WAS ENCOURAGED TO HOPE MY PRESENTATTEMPTS WOULD AT LEAST LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF FUTURE SUCCESS. NORCOULD I CONSIDER THE MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF MY PLAN AS ANYARGUMENT OF ITS IMPRACTICABILITY. IT WAS WITH THESE FEELINGS THAT IBEGAN THE CREATION OF A HUMAN BEING. AS THE MINUTENESS OF THE PARTSFORMED A GREAT HINDRANCE TO MY SPEED I RESOLVED CONTRARY TO MY FIRSTINTENTION TO MAKE THE BEING OF A GIGANTIC STATURE THAT IS TO SAYABOUT EIGHT FEET IN HEIGHT AND PROPORTIONABLY LARGE. AFTER HAVINGFORMED THIS DETERMINATION AND HAVING SPENT SOME MONTHS IN SUCCESSFULLYCOLLECTING AND ARRANGING MY MATERIALS I BEGAN.NO ONE CAN CONCEIVE THE VARIETY OF FEELINGS WHICH BORE ME ONWARDS LIKEA HURRICANE IN THE FIRST ENTHUSIASM OF SUCCESS. LIFE AND DEATHAPPEARED TO ME IDEAL BOUNDS WHICH I SHOULD FIRST BREAK THROUGH ANDPOUR A TORRENT OF LIGHT INTO OUR DARK WORLD. A NEW SPECIES WOULD BLESSME AS ITS CREATOR AND SOURCE MANY HAPPY AND EXCELLENT NATURES WOULDOWE THEIR BEING TO ME. NO FATHER COULD CLAIM THE GRATITUDE OF HISCHILD SO COMPLETELY AS I SHOULD DESERVE THEIRS. PURSUING THESEREFLECTIONS I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD BESTOW ANIMATION UPON LIFELESSMATTER I MIGHT IN PROCESS OF TIME ALTHOUGH I NOW FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLERENEW LIFE WHERE DEATH HAD APPARENTLY DEVOTED THE BODY TO CORRUPTION.THESE THOUGHTS SUPPORTED MY SPIRITS WHILE I PURSUED MY UNDERTAKINGWITH UNREMITTING ARDOUR. MY CHEEK HAD GROWN PALE WITH STUDY AND MYPERSON HAD BECOME EMACIATED WITH CONFINEMENT. SOMETIMES ON THE VERYBRINK OF CERTAINTY I FAILED YET STILL I CLUNG TO THE HOPE WHICH THENEXT DAY OR THE NEXT HOUR MIGHT REALISE. ONE SECRET WHICH I ALONEPOSSESSED WAS THE HOPE TO WHICH I HAD DEDICATED MYSELF AND THE MOONGAZED ON MY MIDNIGHT LABOURS WHILE WITH UNRELAXED AND BREATHLESSEAGERNESS I PURSUED NATURE TO HER HIDINGPLACES. WHO SHALL CONCEIVETHE HORRORS OF MY SECRET TOIL AS I DABBLED AMONG THE UNHALLOWED DAMPSOF THE GRAVE OR TORTURED THE LIVING ANIMAL TO ANIMATE THE LIFELESSCLAY MY LIMBS NOW TREMBLE AND MY EYES SWIM WITH THE REMEMBRANCE BUTTHEN A RESISTLESS AND ALMOST FRANTIC IMPULSE URGED ME FORWARD I SEEMEDTO HAVE LOST ALL SOUL OR SENSATION BUT FOR THIS ONE PURSUIT. IT WASINDEED BUT A PASSING TRANCE THAT ONLY MADE ME FEEL WITH RENEWEDACUTENESS SO SOON AS THE UNNATURAL STIMULUS CEASING TO OPERATE I HADRETURNED TO MY OLD HABITS. I COLLECTED BONES FROM CHARNELHOUSES ANDDISTURBED WITH PROFANE FINGERS THE TREMENDOUS SECRETS OF THE HUMANFRAME. IN A SOLITARY CHAMBER OR RATHER CELL AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSEAND SEPARATED FROM ALL THE OTHER APARTMENTS BY A GALLERY AND STAIRCASEI KEPT MY WORKSHOP OF FILTHY CREATION MY EYEBALLS WERE STARTING FROMTHEIR SOCKETS IN ATTENDING TO THE DETAILS OF MY EMPLOYMENT. THEDISSECTING ROOM AND THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE FURNISHED MANY OF MY MATERIALSAND OFTEN DID MY HUMAN NATURE TURN WITH LOATHING FROM MY OCCUPATIONWHILST STILL URGED ON BY AN EAGERNESS WHICH PERPETUALLY INCREASED IBROUGHT MY WORK NEAR TO A CONCLUSION.THE SUMMER MONTHS PASSED WHILE I WAS THUS ENGAGED HEART AND SOUL INONE PURSUIT. IT WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL SEASON NEVER DID THE FIELDSBESTOW A MORE PLENTIFUL HARVEST OR THE VINES YIELD A MORE LUXURIANTVINTAGE BUT MY EYES WERE INSENSIBLE TO THE CHARMS OF NATURE. AND THESAME FEELINGS WHICH MADE ME NEGLECT THE SCENES AROUND ME CAUSED ME ALSOTO FORGET THOSE FRIENDS WHO WERE SO MANY MILES ABSENT AND WHOM I HADNOT SEEN FOR SO LONG A TIME. I KNEW MY SILENCE DISQUIETED THEM AND IWELL REMEMBERED THE WORDS OF MY FATHER I KNOW THAT WHILE YOU AREPLEASED WITH YOURSELF YOU WILL THINK OF US WITH AFFECTION AND WE SHALLHEAR REGULARLY FROM YOU. YOU MUST PARDON ME IF I REGARD ANYINTERRUPTION IN YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AS A PROOF THAT YOUR OTHER DUTIESARE EQUALLY NEGLECTED.I KNEW WELL THEREFORE WHAT WOULD BE MY FATHERS FEELINGS BUT I COULDNOT TEAR MY THOUGHTS FROM MY EMPLOYMENT LOATHSOME IN ITSELF BUT WHICHHAD TAKEN AN IRRESISTIBLE HOLD OF MY IMAGINATION. I WISHED AS ITWERE TO PROCRASTINATE ALL THAT RELATED TO MY FEELINGS OF AFFECTIONUNTIL THE GREAT OBJECT WHICH SWALLOWED UP EVERY HABIT OF MY NATURESHOULD BE COMPLETED.I THEN THOUGHT THAT MY FATHER WOULD BE UNJUST IF HE ASCRIBED MY NEGLECTTO VICE OR FAULTINESS ON MY PART BUT I AM NOW CONVINCED THAT HE WASJUSTIFIED IN CONCEIVING THAT I SHOULD NOT BE ALTOGETHER FREE FROMBLAME. A HUMAN BEING IN PERFECTION OUGHT ALWAYS TO PRESERVE A CALM ANDPEACEFUL MIND AND NEVER TO ALLOW PASSION OR A TRANSITORY DESIRE TODISTURB HIS TRANQUILLITY. I DO NOT THINK THAT THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGEIS AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE. IF THE STUDY TO WHICH YOU APPLY YOURSELFHAS A TENDENCY TO WEAKEN YOUR AFFECTIONS AND TO DESTROY YOUR TASTE FORTHOSE SIMPLE PLEASURES IN WHICH NO ALLOY CAN POSSIBLY MIX THEN THATSTUDY IS CERTAINLY UNLAWFUL THAT IS TO SAY NOT BEFITTING THE HUMANMIND. IF THIS RULE WERE ALWAYS OBSERVED IF NO MAN ALLOWED ANY PURSUITWHATSOEVER TO INTERFERE WITH THE TRANQUILLITY OF HIS DOMESTICAFFECTIONS GREECE HAD NOT BEEN ENSLAVED CSAR WOULD HAVE SPARED HISCOUNTRY AMERICA WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED MORE GRADUALLY AND THEEMPIRES OF MEXICO AND PERU HAD NOT BEEN DESTROYED.BUT I FORGET THAT I AM MORALIZING IN THE MOST INTERESTING PART OF MYTALE AND YOUR LOOKS REMIND ME TO PROCEED.MY FATHER MADE NO REPROACH IN HIS LETTERS AND ONLY TOOK NOTICE OF MYSILENCE BY INQUIRING INTO MY OCCUPATIONS MORE PARTICULARLY THAN BEFORE.WINTER SPRING AND SUMMER PASSED AWAY DURING MY LABOURS BUT I DID NOTWATCH THE BLOSSOM OR THE EXPANDING LEAVESSIGHTS WHICH BEFORE ALWAYSYIELDED ME SUPREME DELIGHTSO DEEPLY WAS I ENGROSSED IN MYOCCUPATION. THE LEAVES OF THAT YEAR HAD WITHERED BEFORE MY WORK DREW NEARTO A CLOSE AND NOW EVERY DAY SHOWED ME MORE PLAINLY HOW WELL I HADSUCCEEDED. BUT MY ENTHUSIASM WAS CHECKED BY MY ANXIETY AND I APPEAREDRATHER LIKE ONE DOOMED BY SLAVERY TO TOIL IN THE MINES OR ANY OTHERUNWHOLESOME TRADE THAN AN ARTIST OCCUPIED BY HIS FAVOURITE EMPLOYMENT.EVERY NIGHT I WAS OPPRESSED BY A SLOW FEVER AND I BECAME NERVOUS TO A MOSTPAINFUL DEGREE THE FALL OF A LEAF STARTLED ME AND I SHUNNED MY FELLOWCREATURES AS IF I HAD BEEN GUILTY OF A CRIME. SOMETIMES I GREW ALARMED ATTHE WRECK I PERCEIVED THAT I HAD BECOME THE ENERGY OF MY PURPOSE ALONESUSTAINED ME MY LABOURS WOULD SOON END AND I BELIEVED THAT EXERCISE ANDAMUSEMENT WOULD THEN DRIVE AWAY INCIPIENT DISEASE AND I PROMISED MYSELFBOTH OF THESE WHEN MY CREATION SHOULD BE COMPLETE.CHAPTER IT WAS ON A DREARY NIGHT OF NOVEMBER THAT I BEHELD THE ACCOMPLISHMENTOF MY TOILS. WITH AN ANXIETY THAT ALMOST AMOUNTED TO AGONY ICOLLECTED THE INSTRUMENTS OF LIFE AROUND ME THAT I MIGHT INFUSE ASPARK OF BEING INTO THE LIFELESS THING THAT LAY AT MY FEET. IT WASALREADY ONE IN THE MORNING THE RAIN PATTERED DISMALLY AGAINST THEPANES AND MY CANDLE WAS NEARLY BURNT OUT WHEN BY THE GLIMMER OF THEHALFEXTINGUISHED LIGHT I SAW THE DULL YELLOW EYE OF THE CREATUREOPEN IT BREATHED HARD AND A CONVULSIVE MOTION AGITATED ITS LIMBS.HOW CAN I DESCRIBE MY EMOTIONS AT THIS CATASTROPHE OR HOW DELINEATETHE WRETCH WHOM WITH SUCH INFINITE PAINS AND CARE I HAD ENDEAVOURED TOFORM HIS LIMBS WERE IN PROPORTION AND I HAD SELECTED HIS FEATURES ASBEAUTIFUL. BEAUTIFUL GREAT GOD HIS YELLOW SKIN SCARCELY COVEREDTHE WORK OF MUSCLES AND ARTERIES BENEATH HIS HAIR WAS OF A LUSTROUSBLACK AND FLOWING HIS TEETH OF A PEARLY WHITENESS BUT THESELUXURIANCES ONLY FORMED A MORE HORRID CONTRAST WITH HIS WATERY EYESTHAT SEEMED ALMOST OF THE SAME COLOUR AS THE DUNWHITE SOCKETS IN WHICHTHEY WERE SET HIS SHRIVELLED COMPLEXION AND STRAIGHT BLACK LIPS.THE DIFFERENT ACCIDENTS OF LIFE ARE NOT SO CHANGEABLE AS THE FEELINGSOF HUMAN NATURE. I HAD WORKED HARD FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS FOR THE SOLEPURPOSE OF INFUSING LIFE INTO AN INANIMATE BODY. FOR THIS I HADDEPRIVED MYSELF OF REST AND HEALTH. I HAD DESIRED IT WITH AN ARDOURTHAT FAR EXCEEDED MODERATION BUT NOW THAT I HAD FINISHED THE BEAUTYOF THE DREAM VANISHED AND BREATHLESS HORROR AND DISGUST FILLED MYHEART. UNABLE TO ENDURE THE ASPECT OF THE BEING I HAD CREATED IRUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM AND CONTINUED A LONG TIME TRAVERSING MYBEDCHAMBER UNABLE TO COMPOSE MY MIND TO SLEEP. AT LENGTH LASSITUDESUCCEEDED TO THE TUMULT I HAD BEFORE ENDURED AND I THREW MYSELF ON THEBED IN MY CLOTHES ENDEAVOURING TO SEEK A FEW MOMENTS OF FORGETFULNESS.BUT IT WAS IN VAIN I SLEPT INDEED BUT I WAS DISTURBED BY THE WILDESTDREAMS. I THOUGHT I SAW ELIZABETH IN THE BLOOM OF HEALTH WALKING INTHE STREETS OF INGOLSTADT. DELIGHTED AND SURPRISED I EMBRACED HERBUT AS I IMPRINTED THE FIRST KISS ON HER LIPS THEY BECAME LIVID WITHTHE HUE OF DEATH HER FEATURES APPEARED TO CHANGE AND I THOUGHT THAT IHELD THE CORPSE OF MY DEAD MOTHER IN MY ARMS A SHROUD ENVELOPED HERFORM AND I SAW THE GRAVEWORMS CRAWLING IN THE FOLDS OF THE FLANNEL.I STARTED FROM MY SLEEP WITH HORROR A COLD DEW COVERED MY FOREHEAD MYTEETH CHATTERED AND EVERY LIMB BECAME CONVULSED WHEN BY THE DIM ANDYELLOW LIGHT OF THE MOON AS IT FORCED ITS WAY THROUGH THE WINDOWSHUTTERS I BEHELD THE WRETCHTHE MISERABLE MONSTER WHOM I HADCREATED. HE HELD UP THE CURTAIN OF THE BED AND HIS EYES IF EYES THEYMAY BE CALLED WERE FIXED ON ME. HIS JAWS OPENED AND HE MUTTERED SOMEINARTICULATE SOUNDS WHILE A GRIN WRINKLED HIS CHEEKS. HE MIGHT HAVESPOKEN BUT I DID NOT HEAR ONE HAND WAS STRETCHED OUT SEEMINGLY TODETAIN ME BUT I ESCAPED AND RUSHED DOWNSTAIRS. I TOOK REFUGE IN THECOURTYARD BELONGING TO THE HOUSE WHICH I INHABITED WHERE I REMAINEDDURING THE REST OF THE NIGHT WALKING UP AND DOWN IN THE GREATESTAGITATION LISTENING ATTENTIVELY CATCHING AND FEARING EACH SOUND AS IFIT WERE TO ANNOUNCE THE APPROACH OF THE DEMONIACAL CORPSE TO WHICH IHAD SO MISERABLY GIVEN LIFE.OH NO MORTAL COULD SUPPORT THE HORROR OF THAT COUNTENANCE. A MUMMYAGAIN ENDUED WITH ANIMATION COULD NOT BE SO HIDEOUS AS THAT WRETCH. IHAD GAZED ON HIM WHILE UNFINISHED HE WAS UGLY THEN BUT WHEN THOSEMUSCLES AND JOINTS WERE RENDERED CAPABLE OF MOTION IT BECAME A THINGSUCH AS EVEN DANTE COULD NOT HAVE CONCEIVED.I PASSED THE NIGHT WRETCHEDLY. SOMETIMES MY PULSE BEAT SO QUICKLY ANDHARDLY THAT I FELT THE PALPITATION OF EVERY ARTERY AT OTHERS I NEARLYSANK TO THE GROUND THROUGH LANGUOR AND EXTREME WEAKNESS. MINGLED WITHTHIS HORROR I FELT THE BITTERNESS OF DISAPPOINTMENT DREAMS THAT HADBEEN MY FOOD AND PLEASANT REST FOR SO LONG A SPACE WERE NOW BECOME AHELL TO ME AND THE CHANGE WAS SO RAPID THE OVERTHROW SO COMPLETEMORNING DISMAL AND WET AT LENGTH DAWNED AND DISCOVERED TO MYSLEEPLESS AND ACHING EYES THE CHURCH OF INGOLSTADT ITS WHITE STEEPLEAND CLOCK WHICH INDICATED THE SIXTH HOUR. THE PORTER OPENED THE GATESOF THE COURT WHICH HAD THAT NIGHT BEEN MY ASYLUM AND I ISSUED INTOTHE STREETS PACING THEM WITH QUICK STEPS AS IF I SOUGHT TO AVOID THEWRETCH WHOM I FEARED EVERY TURNING OF THE STREET WOULD PRESENT TO MYVIEW. I DID NOT DARE RETURN TO THE APARTMENT WHICH I INHABITED BUTFELT IMPELLED TO HURRY ON ALTHOUGH DRENCHED BY THE RAIN WHICH POUREDFROM A BLACK AND COMFORTLESS SKY.I CONTINUED WALKING IN THIS MANNER FOR SOME TIME ENDEAVOURING BYBODILY EXERCISE TO EASE THE LOAD THAT WEIGHED UPON MY MIND. ITRAVERSED THE STREETS WITHOUT ANY CLEAR CONCEPTION OF WHERE I WAS ORWHAT I WAS DOING. MY HEART PALPITATED IN THE SICKNESS OF FEAR AND IHURRIED ON WITH IRREGULAR STEPS NOT DARING TO LOOK ABOUT ME  LIKE ONE WHO ON A LONELY ROAD DOTH WALK IN FEAR AND DREAD AND HAVING ONCE TURNED ROUND WALKS ON AND TURNS NO MORE HIS HEAD BECAUSE HE KNOWS A FRIGHTFUL FIEND DOTH CLOSE BEHIND HIM TREAD.  COLERIDGES ANCIENT MARINER.CONTINUING THUS I CAME AT LENGTH OPPOSITE TO THE INN AT WHICH THE VARIOUSDILIGENCES AND CARRIAGES USUALLY STOPPED. HERE I PAUSED I KNEW NOT WHYBUT I REMAINED SOME MINUTES WITH MY EYES FIXED ON A COACH THAT WAS COMINGTOWARDS ME FROM THE OTHER END OF THE STREET. AS IT DREW NEARER I OBSERVEDTHAT IT WAS THE SWISS DILIGENCE IT STOPPED JUST WHERE I WAS STANDING ANDON THE DOOR BEING OPENED I PERCEIVED HENRY CLERVAL WHO ON SEEING MEINSTANTLY SPRUNG OUT. MY DEAR FRANKENSTEIN EXCLAIMED HEHOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU HOW FORTUNATE THAT YOU SHOULD BE HERE ATTHE VERY MOMENT OF MY ALIGHTINGNOTHING COULD EQUAL MY DELIGHT ON SEEING CLERVAL HIS PRESENCE BROUGHT BACKTO MY THOUGHTS MY FATHER ELIZABETH AND ALL THOSE SCENES OF HOME SO DEARTO MY RECOLLECTION. I GRASPED HIS HAND AND IN A MOMENT FORGOT MY HORRORAND MISFORTUNE I FELT SUDDENLY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING MANY MONTHSCALM AND SERENE JOY. I WELCOMED MY FRIEND THEREFORE IN THE MOST CORDIALMANNER AND WE WALKED TOWARDS MY COLLEGE. CLERVAL CONTINUED TALKING FORSOME TIME ABOUT OUR MUTUAL FRIENDS AND HIS OWN GOOD FORTUNE IN BEINGPERMITTED TO COME TO INGOLSTADT. YOU MAY EASILY BELIEVE SAIDHE HOW GREAT WAS THE DIFFICULTY TO PERSUADE MY FATHER THAT ALLNECESSARY KNOWLEDGE WAS NOT COMPRISED IN THE NOBLE ART OF BOOKKEEPINGAND INDEED I BELIEVE I LEFT HIM INCREDULOUS TO THE LAST FOR HIS CONSTANTANSWER TO MY UNWEARIED ENTREATIES WAS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE DUTCHSCHOOLMASTER IN THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD I HAVE TEN THOUSAND FLORINSA YEAR WITHOUT GREEK I EAT HEARTILY WITHOUT GREEK. BUT HISAFFECTION FOR ME AT LENGTH OVERCAME HIS DISLIKE OF LEARNING AND HE HASPERMITTED ME TO UNDERTAKE A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY TO THE LAND OFKNOWLEDGE.IT GIVES ME THE GREATEST DELIGHT TO SEE YOU BUT TELL ME HOW YOU LEFTMY FATHER BROTHERS AND ELIZABETH.VERY WELL AND VERY HAPPY ONLY A LITTLE UNEASY THAT THEY HEAR FROMYOU SO SELDOM. BY THE BY I MEAN TO LECTURE YOU A LITTLE UPON THEIRACCOUNT MYSELF. BUT MY DEAR FRANKENSTEIN CONTINUED HE STOPPINGSHORT AND GAZING FULL IN MY FACE I DID NOT BEFORE REMARK HOW VERY ILLYOU APPEAR SO THIN AND PALE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HAD BEEN WATCHING FORSEVERAL NIGHTS.YOU HAVE GUESSED RIGHT I HAVE LATELY BEEN SO DEEPLY ENGAGED IN ONEOCCUPATION THAT I HAVE NOT ALLOWED MYSELF SUFFICIENT REST AS YOU SEEBUT I HOPE I SINCERELY HOPE THAT ALL THESE EMPLOYMENTS ARE NOW AT ANEND AND THAT I AM AT LENGTH FREE.I TREMBLED EXCESSIVELY I COULD NOT ENDURE TO THINK OF AND FAR LESS TOALLUDE TO THE OCCURRENCES OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT. I WALKED WITH AQUICK PACE AND WE SOON ARRIVED AT MY COLLEGE. I THEN REFLECTED ANDTHE THOUGHT MADE ME SHIVER THAT THE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LEFT IN MYAPARTMENT MIGHT STILL BE THERE ALIVE AND WALKING ABOUT. I DREADED TOBEHOLD THIS MONSTER BUT I FEARED STILL MORE THAT HENRY SHOULD SEE HIM.ENTREATING HIM THEREFORE TO REMAIN A FEW MINUTES AT THE BOTTOM OF THESTAIRS I DARTED UP TOWARDS MY OWN ROOM. MY HAND WAS ALREADY ON THELOCK OF THE DOOR BEFORE I RECOLLECTED MYSELF. I THEN PAUSED AND ACOLD SHIVERING CAME OVER ME. I THREW THE DOOR FORCIBLY OPEN ASCHILDREN ARE ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN THEY EXPECT A SPECTRE TO STAND INWAITING FOR THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT NOTHING APPEARED. I STEPPEDFEARFULLY IN THE APARTMENT WAS EMPTY AND MY BEDROOM WAS ALSO FREEDFROM ITS HIDEOUS GUEST. I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT SO GREAT A GOODFORTUNE COULD HAVE BEFALLEN ME BUT WHEN I BECAME ASSURED THAT MY ENEMYHAD INDEED FLED I CLAPPED MY HANDS FOR JOY AND RAN DOWN TO CLERVAL.WE ASCENDED INTO MY ROOM AND THE SERVANT PRESENTLY BROUGHT BREAKFASTBUT I WAS UNABLE TO CONTAIN MYSELF. IT WAS NOT JOY ONLY THAT POSSESSEDME I FELT MY FLESH TINGLE WITH EXCESS OF SENSITIVENESS AND MY PULSEBEAT RAPIDLY. I WAS UNABLE TO REMAIN FOR A SINGLE INSTANT IN THE SAMEPLACE I JUMPED OVER THE CHAIRS CLAPPED MY HANDS AND LAUGHED ALOUD.CLERVAL AT FIRST ATTRIBUTED MY UNUSUAL SPIRITS TO JOY ON HIS ARRIVALBUT WHEN HE OBSERVED ME MORE ATTENTIVELY HE SAW A WILDNESS IN MY EYESFOR WHICH HE COULD NOT ACCOUNT AND MY LOUD UNRESTRAINED HEARTLESSLAUGHTER FRIGHTENED AND ASTONISHED HIM.MY DEAR VICTOR CRIED HE WHAT FOR GODS SAKEIS THE MATTER DO NOT LAUGH IN THAT MANNER. HOW ILL YOU ARE WHAT IS THECAUSE OF ALL THISDO NOT ASK ME CRIED I PUTTING MY HANDS BEFORE MY EYES FOR ITHOUGHT I SAW THE DREADED SPECTRE GLIDE INTO THE ROOM HE CANTELL. OH SAVE ME SAVE ME I IMAGINED THAT THE MONSTER SEIZED MEI STRUGGLED FURIOUSLY AND FELL DOWN IN A FIT.POOR CLERVAL WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN HIS FEELINGS A MEETING WHICH HEANTICIPATED WITH SUCH JOY SO STRANGELY TURNED TO BITTERNESS. BUT IWAS NOT THE WITNESS OF HIS GRIEF FOR I WAS LIFELESS AND DID NOTRECOVER MY SENSES FOR A LONG LONG TIME.THIS WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF A NERVOUS FEVER WHICH CONFINED ME FORSEVERAL MONTHS. DURING ALL THAT TIME HENRY WAS MY ONLY NURSE. IAFTERWARDS LEARNED THAT KNOWING MY FATHERS ADVANCED AGE AND UNFITNESSFOR SO LONG A JOURNEY AND HOW WRETCHED MY SICKNESS WOULD MAKEELIZABETH HE SPARED THEM THIS GRIEF BY CONCEALING THE EXTENT OF MYDISORDER. HE KNEW THAT I COULD NOT HAVE A MORE KIND AND ATTENTIVENURSE THAN HIMSELF AND FIRM IN THE HOPE HE FELT OF MY RECOVERY HEDID NOT DOUBT THAT INSTEAD OF DOING HARM HE PERFORMED THE KINDESTACTION THAT HE COULD TOWARDS THEM.BUT I WAS IN REALITY VERY ILL AND SURELY NOTHING BUT THE UNBOUNDED ANDUNREMITTING ATTENTIONS OF MY FRIEND COULD HAVE RESTORED ME TO LIFE.THE FORM OF THE MONSTER ON WHOM I HAD BESTOWED EXISTENCE WAS FOR EVERBEFORE MY EYES AND I RAVED INCESSANTLY CONCERNING HIM. DOUBTLESS MYWORDS SURPRISED HENRY HE AT FIRST BELIEVED THEM TO BE THE WANDERINGSOF MY DISTURBED IMAGINATION BUT THE PERTINACITY WITH WHICH ICONTINUALLY RECURRED TO THE SAME SUBJECT PERSUADED HIM THAT MY DISORDERINDEED OWED ITS ORIGIN TO SOME UNCOMMON AND TERRIBLE EVENT.BY VERY SLOW DEGREES AND WITH FREQUENT RELAPSES THAT ALARMED ANDGRIEVED MY FRIEND I RECOVERED. I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I BECAMECAPABLE OF OBSERVING OUTWARD OBJECTS WITH ANY KIND OF PLEASURE IPERCEIVED THAT THE FALLEN LEAVES HAD DISAPPEARED AND THAT THE YOUNGBUDS WERE SHOOTING FORTH FROM THE TREES THAT SHADED MY WINDOW. IT WASA DIVINE SPRING AND THE SEASON CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO MYCONVALESCENCE. I FELT ALSO SENTIMENTS OF JOY AND AFFECTION REVIVE INMY BOSOM MY GLOOM DISAPPEARED AND IN A SHORT TIME I BECAME ASCHEERFUL AS BEFORE I WAS ATTACKED BY THE FATAL PASSION.DEAREST CLERVAL EXCLAIMED I HOW KIND HOW VERY GOODYOU ARE TO ME. THIS WHOLE WINTER INSTEAD OF BEING SPENT IN STUDY AS YOUPROMISED YOURSELF HAS BEEN CONSUMED IN MY SICK ROOM. HOW SHALL I EVERREPAY YOU I FEEL THE GREATEST REMORSE FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF WHICH IHAVE BEEN THE OCCASION BUT YOU WILL FORGIVE ME.YOU WILL REPAY ME ENTIRELY IF YOU DO NOT DISCOMPOSE YOURSELF BUT GETWELL AS FAST AS YOU CAN AND SINCE YOU APPEAR IN SUCH GOOD SPIRITS IMAY SPEAK TO YOU ON ONE SUBJECT MAY I NOTI TREMBLED. ONE SUBJECT WHAT COULD IT BE COULD HE ALLUDE TO AN OBJECT ONWHOM I DARED NOT EVEN THINKCOMPOSE YOURSELF SAID CLERVAL WHO OBSERVED MY CHANGE OFCOLOUR I WILL NOT MENTION IT IF IT AGITATES YOU BUT YOUR FATHERAND COUSIN WOULD BE VERY HAPPY IF THEY RECEIVED A LETTER FROM YOU IN YOUROWN HANDWRITING. THEY HARDLY KNOW HOW ILL YOU HAVE BEEN AND ARE UNEASY ATYOUR LONG SILENCE.IS THAT ALL MY DEAR HENRY HOW COULD YOU SUPPOSE THAT MY FIRSTTHOUGHT WOULD NOT FLY TOWARDS THOSE DEAR DEAR FRIENDS WHOM I LOVE ANDWHO ARE SO DESERVING OF MY LOVEIF THIS IS YOUR PRESENT TEMPER MY FRIEND YOU WILL PERHAPS BE GLADTO SEE A LETTER THAT HAS BEEN LYING HERE SOME DAYS FOR YOU IT IS FROMYOUR COUSIN I BELIEVE.CHAPTER CLERVAL THEN PUT THE FOLLOWING LETTER INTO MY HANDS. IT WAS FROM MYOWN ELIZABETHMY DEAREST COUSINYOU HAVE BEEN ILL VERY ILL AND EVEN THE CONSTANT LETTERS OF DEARKIND HENRY ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO REASSURE ME ON YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU AREFORBIDDEN TO WRITETO HOLD A PEN YET ONE WORD FROM YOU DEAR VICTORIS NECESSARY TO CALM OUR APPREHENSIONS. FOR A LONG TIME I HAVE THOUGHTTHAT EACH POST WOULD BRING THIS LINE AND MY PERSUASIONS HAVERESTRAINED MY UNCLE FROM UNDERTAKING A JOURNEY TO INGOLSTADT. I HAVEPREVENTED HIS ENCOUNTERING THE INCONVENIENCES AND PERHAPS DANGERS OF SOLONG A JOURNEY YET HOW OFTEN HAVE I REGRETTED NOT BEING ABLE TOPERFORM IT MYSELF I FIGURE TO MYSELF THAT THE TASK OF ATTENDING ONYOUR SICKBED HAS DEVOLVED ON SOME MERCENARY OLD NURSE WHO COULD NEVERGUESS YOUR WISHES NOR MINISTER TO THEM WITH THE CARE AND AFFECTION OFYOUR POOR COUSIN. YET THAT IS OVER NOW CLERVAL WRITES THAT INDEEDYOU ARE GETTING BETTER. I EAGERLY HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONFIRM THISINTELLIGENCE SOON IN YOUR OWN HANDWRITING.GET WELLAND RETURN TO US. YOU WILL FIND A HAPPY CHEERFUL HOME ANDFRIENDS WHO LOVE YOU DEARLY. YOUR FATHERS HEALTH IS VIGOROUS AND HEASKS BUT TO SEE YOU BUT TO BE ASSURED THAT YOU ARE WELL AND NOT ACARE WILL EVER CLOUD HIS BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE. HOW PLEASED YOU WOULDBE TO REMARK THE IMPROVEMENT OF OUR ERNEST HE IS NOW SIXTEEN AND FULLOF ACTIVITY AND SPIRIT. HE IS DESIROUS TO BE A TRUE SWISS AND TO ENTERINTO FOREIGN SERVICE BUT WE CANNOT PART WITH HIM AT LEAST UNTIL HISELDER BROTHER RETURNS TO US. MY UNCLE IS NOT PLEASED WITH THE IDEA OFA MILITARY CAREER IN A DISTANT COUNTRY BUT ERNEST NEVER HAD YOURPOWERS OF APPLICATION. HE LOOKS UPON STUDY AS AN ODIOUS FETTER HISTIME IS SPENT IN THE OPEN AIR CLIMBING THE HILLS OR ROWING ON THELAKE. I FEAR THAT HE WILL BECOME AN IDLER UNLESS WE YIELD THE POINTAND PERMIT HIM TO ENTER ON THE PROFESSION WHICH HE HAS SELECTED.LITTLE ALTERATION EXCEPT THE GROWTH OF OUR DEAR CHILDREN HAS TAKENPLACE SINCE YOU LEFT US. THE BLUE LAKE AND SNOWCLAD MOUNTAINSTHEYNEVER CHANGE AND I THINK OUR PLACID HOME AND OUR CONTENTED HEARTS AREREGULATED BY THE SAME IMMUTABLE LAWS. MY TRIFLING OCCUPATIONS TAKE UPMY TIME AND AMUSE ME AND I AM REWARDED FOR ANY EXERTIONS BY SEEINGNONE BUT HAPPY KIND FACES AROUND ME. SINCE YOU LEFT US BUT ONECHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE IN OUR LITTLE HOUSEHOLD. DO YOU REMEMBER ONWHAT OCCASION JUSTINE MORITZ ENTERED OUR FAMILY PROBABLY YOU DO NOTI WILL RELATE HER HISTORY THEREFORE IN A FEW WORDS. MADAME MORITZHER MOTHER WAS A WIDOW WITH FOUR CHILDREN OF WHOM JUSTINE WAS THETHIRD. THIS GIRL HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE FAVOURITE OF HER FATHER BUTTHROUGH A STRANGE PERVERSITY HER MOTHER COULD NOT ENDURE HER ANDAFTER THE DEATH OF M. MORITZ TREATED HER VERY ILL. MY AUNT OBSERVEDTHIS AND WHEN JUSTINE WAS TWELVE YEARS OF AGE PREVAILED ON HER MOTHERTO ALLOW HER TO LIVE AT OUR HOUSE. THE REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS OF OURCOUNTRY HAVE PRODUCED SIMPLER AND HAPPIER MANNERS THAN THOSE WHICHPREVAIL IN THE GREAT MONARCHIES THAT SURROUND IT. HENCE THERE IS LESSDISTINCTION BETWEEN THE SEVERAL CLASSES OF ITS INHABITANTS AND THELOWER ORDERS BEING NEITHER SO POOR NOR SO DESPISED THEIR MANNERS AREMORE REFINED AND MORAL. A SERVANT IN GENEVA DOES NOT MEAN THE SAMETHING AS A SERVANT IN FRANCE AND ENGLAND. JUSTINE THUS RECEIVED INOUR FAMILY LEARNED THE DUTIES OF A SERVANT A CONDITION WHICH IN OURFORTUNATE COUNTRY DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IDEA OF IGNORANCE AND ASACRIFICE OF THE DIGNITY OF A HUMAN BEING.JUSTINE YOU MAY REMEMBER WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE OF YOURS AND IRECOLLECT YOU ONCE REMARKED THAT IF YOU WERE IN AN ILL HUMOUR ONEGLANCE FROM JUSTINE COULD DISSIPATE IT FOR THE SAME REASON THATARIOSTO GIVES CONCERNING THE BEAUTY OF ANGELICASHE LOOKED SOFRANKHEARTED AND HAPPY. MY AUNT CONCEIVED A GREAT ATTACHMENT FOR HERBY WHICH SHE WAS INDUCED TO GIVE HER AN EDUCATION SUPERIOR TO THATWHICH SHE HAD AT FIRST INTENDED. THIS BENEFIT WAS FULLY REPAIDJUSTINE WAS THE MOST GRATEFUL LITTLE CREATURE IN THE WORLD I DO NOTMEAN THAT SHE MADE ANY PROFESSIONS I NEVER HEARD ONE PASS HER LIPS BUTYOU COULD SEE BY HER EYES THAT SHE ALMOST ADORED HER PROTECTRESS.ALTHOUGH HER DISPOSITION WAS GAY AND IN MANY RESPECTS INCONSIDERATEYET SHE PAID THE GREATEST ATTENTION TO EVERY GESTURE OF MY AUNT. SHETHOUGHT HER THE MODEL OF ALL EXCELLENCE AND ENDEAVOURED TO IMITATE HERPHRASEOLOGY AND MANNERS SO THAT EVEN NOW SHE OFTEN REMINDS ME OF HER.WHEN MY DEAREST AUNT DIED EVERY ONE WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN THEIR OWNGRIEF TO NOTICE POOR JUSTINE WHO HAD ATTENDED HER DURING HER ILLNESSWITH THE MOST ANXIOUS AFFECTION. POOR JUSTINE WAS VERY ILL BUT OTHERTRIALS WERE RESERVED FOR HER.ONE BY ONE HER BROTHERS AND SISTER DIED AND HER MOTHER WITH THEEXCEPTION OF HER NEGLECTED DAUGHTER WAS LEFT CHILDLESS. THECONSCIENCE OF THE WOMAN WAS TROUBLED SHE BEGAN TO THINK THAT THEDEATHS OF HER FAVOURITES WAS A JUDGEMENT FROM HEAVEN TO CHASTISE HERPARTIALITY. SHE WAS A ROMAN CATHOLIC AND I BELIEVE HER CONFESSORCONFIRMED THE IDEA WHICH SHE HAD CONCEIVED. ACCORDINGLY A FEW MONTHSAFTER YOUR DEPARTURE FOR INGOLSTADT JUSTINE WAS CALLED HOME BY HERREPENTANT MOTHER. POOR GIRL SHE WEPT WHEN SHE QUITTED OUR HOUSE SHEWAS MUCH ALTERED SINCE THE DEATH OF MY AUNT GRIEF HAD GIVEN SOFTNESSAND A WINNING MILDNESS TO HER MANNERS WHICH HAD BEFORE BEEN REMARKABLEFOR VIVACITY. NOR WAS HER RESIDENCE AT HER MOTHERS HOUSE OF A NATURETO RESTORE HER GAIETY. THE POOR WOMAN WAS VERY VACILLATING IN HERREPENTANCE. SHE SOMETIMES BEGGED JUSTINE TO FORGIVE HER UNKINDNESSBUT MUCH OFTENER ACCUSED HER OF HAVING CAUSED THE DEATHS OF HERBROTHERS AND SISTER. PERPETUAL FRETTING AT LENGTH THREW MADAME MORITZINTO A DECLINE WHICH AT FIRST INCREASED HER IRRITABILITY BUT SHE ISNOW AT PEACE FOR EVER. SHE DIED ON THE FIRST APPROACH OF COLD WEATHERAT THE BEGINNING OF THIS LAST WINTER. JUSTINE HAS JUST RETURNED TO USAND I ASSURE YOU I LOVE HER TENDERLY. SHE IS VERY CLEVER AND GENTLEAND EXTREMELY PRETTY AS I MENTIONED BEFORE HER MIEN AND HEREXPRESSION CONTINUALLY REMIND ME OF MY DEAR AUNT.I MUST SAY ALSO A FEW WORDS TO YOU MY DEAR COUSIN OF LITTLE DARLINGWILLIAM. I WISH YOU COULD SEE HIM HE IS VERY TALL OF HIS AGE WITHSWEET LAUGHING BLUE EYES DARK EYELASHES AND CURLING HAIR. WHEN HESMILES TWO LITTLE DIMPLES APPEAR ON EACH CHEEK WHICH ARE ROSY WITHHEALTH. HE HAS ALREADY HAD ONE OR TWO LITTLE WIVES BUT LOUISA BIRONIS HIS FAVOURITE A PRETTY LITTLE GIRL OF FIVE YEARS OF AGE.NOW DEAR VICTOR I DARE SAY YOU WISH TO BE INDULGED IN A LITTLEGOSSIP CONCERNING THE GOOD PEOPLE OF GENEVA. THE PRETTY MISS MANSFIELDHAS ALREADY RECEIVED THE CONGRATULATORY VISITS ON HER APPROACHINGMARRIAGE WITH A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN JOHN MELBOURNE ESQ. HER UGLYSISTER MANON MARRIED M. DUVILLARD THE RICH BANKER LAST AUTUMN. YOURFAVOURITE SCHOOLFELLOW LOUIS MANOIR HAS SUFFERED SEVERAL MISFORTUNESSINCE THE DEPARTURE OF CLERVAL FROM GENEVA. BUT HE HAS ALREADYRECOVERED HIS SPIRITS AND IS REPORTED TO BE ON THE POINT OF MARRYING ALIVELY PRETTY FRENCHWOMAN MADAME TAVERNIER. SHE IS A WIDOW AND MUCHOLDER THAN MANOIR BUT SHE IS VERY MUCH ADMIRED AND A FAVOURITE WITHEVERYBODY.I HAVE WRITTEN MYSELF INTO BETTER SPIRITS DEAR COUSIN BUT MY ANXIETYRETURNS UPON ME AS I CONCLUDE. WRITE DEAREST VICTORONE LINEONEWORD WILL BE A BLESSING TO US. TEN THOUSAND THANKS TO HENRY FOR HISKINDNESS HIS AFFECTION AND HIS MANY LETTERS WE ARE SINCERELYGRATEFUL. ADIEU MY COUSIN TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND I ENTREATYOU WRITEELIZABETH LAVENZA.GENEVA MARCH TH .DEAR DEAR ELIZABETH I EXCLAIMED WHEN I HAD READ HERLETTER I WILL WRITE INSTANTLY AND RELIEVE THEM FROM THE ANXIETYTHEY MUST FEEL. I WROTE AND THIS EXERTION GREATLY FATIGUED ME BUTMY CONVALESCENCE HAD COMMENCED AND PROCEEDED REGULARLY. IN ANOTHERFORTNIGHT I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE MY CHAMBER.ONE OF MY FIRST DUTIES ON MY RECOVERY WAS TO INTRODUCE CLERVAL TO THESEVERAL PROFESSORS OF THE UNIVERSITY. IN DOING THIS I UNDERWENT AKIND OF ROUGH USAGE ILL BEFITTING THE WOUNDS THAT MY MIND HADSUSTAINED. EVER SINCE THE FATAL NIGHT THE END OF MY LABOURS AND THEBEGINNING OF MY MISFORTUNES I HAD CONCEIVED A VIOLENT ANTIPATHY EVENTO THE NAME OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. WHEN I WAS OTHERWISE QUITE RESTOREDTO HEALTH THE SIGHT OF A CHEMICAL INSTRUMENT WOULD RENEW ALL THE AGONYOF MY NERVOUS SYMPTOMS. HENRY SAW THIS AND HAD REMOVED ALL MYAPPARATUS FROM MY VIEW. HE HAD ALSO CHANGED MY APARTMENT FOR HEPERCEIVED THAT I HAD ACQUIRED A DISLIKE FOR THE ROOM WHICH HADPREVIOUSLY BEEN MY LABORATORY. BUT THESE CARES OF CLERVAL WERE MADE OFNO AVAIL WHEN I VISITED THE PROFESSORS. M. WALDMAN INFLICTED TORTUREWHEN HE PRAISED WITH KINDNESS AND WARMTH THE ASTONISHING PROGRESS IHAD MADE IN THE SCIENCES. HE SOON PERCEIVED THAT I DISLIKED THESUBJECT BUT NOT GUESSING THE REAL CAUSE HE ATTRIBUTED MY FEELINGS TOMODESTY AND CHANGED THE SUBJECT FROM MY IMPROVEMENT TO THE SCIENCEITSELF WITH A DESIRE AS I EVIDENTLY SAW OF DRAWING ME OUT. WHATCOULD I DO HE MEANT TO PLEASE AND HE TORMENTED ME. I FELT AS IF HEHAD PLACED CAREFULLY ONE BY ONE IN MY VIEW THOSE INSTRUMENTS WHICHWERE TO BE AFTERWARDS USED IN PUTTING ME TO A SLOW AND CRUEL DEATH. IWRITHED UNDER HIS WORDS YET DARED NOT EXHIBIT THE PAIN I FELT.CLERVAL WHOSE EYES AND FEELINGS WERE ALWAYS QUICK IN DISCERNING THESENSATIONS OF OTHERS DECLINED THE SUBJECT ALLEGING IN EXCUSE HISTOTAL IGNORANCE AND THE CONVERSATION TOOK A MORE GENERAL TURN. ITHANKED MY FRIEND FROM MY HEART BUT I DID NOT SPEAK. I SAW PLAINLYTHAT HE WAS SURPRISED BUT HE NEVER ATTEMPTED TO DRAW MY SECRET FROMME AND ALTHOUGH I LOVED HIM WITH A MIXTURE OF AFFECTION AND REVERENCETHAT KNEW NO BOUNDS YET I COULD NEVER PERSUADE MYSELF TO CONFIDE INHIM THAT EVENT WHICH WAS SO OFTEN PRESENT TO MY RECOLLECTION BUT WHICHI FEARED THE DETAIL TO ANOTHER WOULD ONLY IMPRESS MORE DEEPLY.M. KREMPE WAS NOT EQUALLY DOCILE AND IN MY CONDITION AT THAT TIME OFALMOST INSUPPORTABLE SENSITIVENESS HIS HARSH BLUNT ENCOMIUMS GAVE ME EVENMORE PAIN THAN THE BENEVOLENT APPROBATION OF M. WALDMAN. DNTHE FELLOW CRIED HE WHY M. CLERVAL I ASSURE YOU HE HASOUTSTRIPT US ALL. AY STARE IF YOU PLEASE BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS TRUE. AYOUNGSTER WHO BUT A FEW YEARS AGO BELIEVED IN CORNELIUS AGRIPPA AS FIRMLYAS IN THE GOSPEL HAS NOW SET HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF THE UNIVERSITY AND IFHE IS NOT SOON PULLED DOWN WE SHALL ALL BE OUT OF COUNTENANCE.AYAY CONTINUED HE OBSERVING MY FACE EXPRESSIVE OF SUFFERINGM. FRANKENSTEIN IS MODEST AN EXCELLENT QUALITY IN A YOUNG MAN.YOUNG MEN SHOULD BE DIFFIDENT OF THEMSELVES YOU KNOW M. CLERVAL I WASMYSELF WHEN YOUNG BUT THAT WEARS OUT IN A VERY SHORT TIME.M. KREMPE HAD NOW COMMENCED AN EULOGY ON HIMSELF WHICH HAPPILY TURNEDTHE CONVERSATION FROM A SUBJECT THAT WAS SO ANNOYING TO ME.CLERVAL HAD NEVER SYMPATHISED IN MY TASTES FOR NATURAL SCIENCE AND HISLITERARY PURSUITS DIFFERED WHOLLY FROM THOSE WHICH HAD OCCUPIED ME. HECAME TO THE UNIVERSITY WITH THE DESIGN OF MAKING HIMSELF COMPLETEMASTER OF THE ORIENTAL LANGUAGES AND THUS HE SHOULD OPEN A FIELD FORTHE PLAN OF LIFE HE HAD MARKED OUT FOR HIMSELF. RESOLVED TO PURSUE NOINGLORIOUS CAREER HE TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD THE EAST AS AFFORDINGSCOPE FOR HIS SPIRIT OF ENTERPRISE. THE PERSIAN ARABIC AND SANSKRITLANGUAGES ENGAGED HIS ATTENTION AND I WAS EASILY INDUCED TO ENTER ONTHE SAME STUDIES. IDLENESS HAD EVER BEEN IRKSOME TO ME AND NOW THAT IWISHED TO FLY FROM REFLECTION AND HATED MY FORMER STUDIES I FELTGREAT RELIEF IN BEING THE FELLOWPUPIL WITH MY FRIEND AND FOUND NOTONLY INSTRUCTION BUT CONSOLATION IN THE WORKS OF THE ORIENTALISTS. IDID NOT LIKE HIM ATTEMPT A CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR DIALECTS FORI DID NOT CONTEMPLATE MAKING ANY OTHER USE OF THEM THAN TEMPORARYAMUSEMENT. I READ MERELY TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MEANING AND THEY WELLREPAID MY LABOURS. THEIR MELANCHOLY IS SOOTHING AND THEIR JOYELEVATING TO A DEGREE I NEVER EXPERIENCED IN STUDYING THE AUTHORS OFANY OTHER COUNTRY. WHEN YOU READ THEIR WRITINGS LIFE APPEARS TOCONSIST IN A WARM SUN AND A GARDEN OF ROSESIN THE SMILES AND FROWNSOF A FAIR ENEMY AND THE FIRE THAT CONSUMES YOUR OWN HEART. HOWDIFFERENT FROM THE MANLY AND HEROICAL POETRY OF GREECE AND ROMESUMMER PASSED AWAY IN THESE OCCUPATIONS AND MY RETURN TO GENEVA WASFIXED FOR THE LATTER END OF AUTUMN BUT BEING DELAYED BY SEVERALACCIDENTS WINTER AND SNOW ARRIVED THE ROADS WERE DEEMED IMPASSABLEAND MY JOURNEY WAS RETARDED UNTIL THE ENSUING SPRING. I FELT THISDELAY VERY BITTERLY FOR I LONGED TO SEE MY NATIVE TOWN AND MY BELOVEDFRIENDS. MY RETURN HAD ONLY BEEN DELAYED SO LONG FROM ANUNWILLINGNESS TO LEAVE CLERVAL IN A STRANGE PLACE BEFORE HE HAD BECOMEACQUAINTED WITH ANY OF ITS INHABITANTS. THE WINTER HOWEVER WAS SPENTCHEERFULLY AND ALTHOUGH THE SPRING WAS UNCOMMONLY LATE WHEN IT CAMEITS BEAUTY COMPENSATED FOR ITS DILATORINESS.THE MONTH OF MAY HAD ALREADY COMMENCED AND I EXPECTED THE LETTER DAILYWHICH WAS TO FIX THE DATE OF MY DEPARTURE WHEN HENRY PROPOSED APEDESTRIAN TOUR IN THE ENVIRONS OF INGOLSTADT THAT I MIGHT BID APERSONAL FAREWELL TO THE COUNTRY I HAD SO LONG INHABITED. I ACCEDEDWITH PLEASURE TO THIS PROPOSITION I WAS FOND OF EXERCISE AND CLERVALHAD ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVOURITE COMPANION IN THE RAMBLE OF THIS NATURETHAT I HAD TAKEN AMONG THE SCENES OF MY NATIVE COUNTRY.WE PASSED A FORTNIGHT IN THESE PERAMBULATIONS MY HEALTH AND SPIRITSHAD LONG BEEN RESTORED AND THEY GAINED ADDITIONAL STRENGTH FROM THESALUBRIOUS AIR I BREATHED THE NATURAL INCIDENTS OF OUR PROGRESS ANDTHE CONVERSATION OF MY FRIEND. STUDY HAD BEFORE SECLUDED ME FROM THEINTERCOURSE OF MY FELLOWCREATURES AND RENDERED ME UNSOCIAL BUTCLERVAL CALLED FORTH THE BETTER FEELINGS OF MY HEART HE AGAIN TAUGHTME TO LOVE THE ASPECT OF NATURE AND THE CHEERFUL FACES OF CHILDREN.EXCELLENT FRIEND HOW SINCERELY YOU DID LOVE ME AND ENDEAVOUR TOELEVATE MY MIND UNTIL IT WAS ON A LEVEL WITH YOUR OWN. A SELFISHPURSUIT HAD CRAMPED AND NARROWED ME UNTIL YOUR GENTLENESS ANDAFFECTION WARMED AND OPENED MY SENSES I BECAME THE SAME HAPPY CREATUREWHO A FEW YEARS AGO LOVED AND BELOVED BY ALL HAD NO SORROW OR CARE.WHEN HAPPY INANIMATE NATURE HAD THE POWER OF BESTOWING ON ME THE MOSTDELIGHTFUL SENSATIONS. A SERENE SKY AND VERDANT FIELDS FILLED ME WITHECSTASY. THE PRESENT SEASON WAS INDEED DIVINE THE FLOWERS OF SPRINGBLOOMED IN THE HEDGES WHILE THOSE OF SUMMER WERE ALREADY IN BUD. IWAS UNDISTURBED BY THOUGHTS WHICH DURING THE PRECEDING YEAR HAD PRESSEDUPON ME NOTWITHSTANDING MY ENDEAVOURS TO THROW THEM OFF WITH ANINVINCIBLE BURDEN.HENRY REJOICED IN MY GAIETY AND SINCERELY SYMPATHISED IN MY FEELINGS HEEXERTED HIMSELF TO AMUSE ME WHILE HE EXPRESSED THE SENSATIONS THAT FILLEDHIS SOUL. THE RESOURCES OF HIS MIND ON THIS OCCASION WERE TRULYASTONISHING HIS CONVERSATION WAS FULL OF IMAGINATION AND VERY OFTEN INIMITATION OF THE PERSIAN AND ARABIC WRITERS HE INVENTED TALES OF WONDERFULFANCY AND PASSION. AT OTHER TIMES HE REPEATED MY FAVOURITE POEMS OR DREWME OUT INTO ARGUMENTS WHICH HE SUPPORTED WITH GREAT INGENUITY.WE RETURNED TO OUR COLLEGE ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON THE PEASANTS WEREDANCING AND EVERY ONE WE MET APPEARED GAY AND HAPPY. MY OWN SPIRITS WEREHIGH AND I BOUNDED ALONG WITH FEELINGS OF UNBRIDLED JOY AND HILARITY.CHAPTER ON MY RETURN I FOUND THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM MY FATHERMY DEAR VICTORYOU HAVE PROBABLY WAITED IMPATIENTLY FOR A LETTER TO FIX THE DATE OFYOUR RETURN TO US AND I WAS AT FIRST TEMPTED TO WRITE ONLY A FEWLINES MERELY MENTIONING THE DAY ON WHICH I SHOULD EXPECT YOU. BUTTHAT WOULD BE A CRUEL KINDNESS AND I DARE NOT DO IT. WHAT WOULD BEYOUR SURPRISE MY SON WHEN YOU EXPECTED A HAPPY AND GLAD WELCOME TOBEHOLD ON THE CONTRARY TEARS AND WRETCHEDNESS AND HOW VICTOR CANI RELATE OUR MISFORTUNE ABSENCE CANNOT HAVE RENDERED YOU CALLOUS TOOUR JOYS AND GRIEFS AND HOW SHALL I INFLICT PAIN ON MY LONG ABSENTSON I WISH TO PREPARE YOU FOR THE WOEFUL NEWS BUT I KNOW IT ISIMPOSSIBLE EVEN NOW YOUR EYE SKIMS OVER THE PAGE TO SEEK THE WORDSWHICH ARE TO CONVEY TO YOU THE HORRIBLE TIDINGS.WILLIAM IS DEADTHAT SWEET CHILD WHOSE SMILES DELIGHTED AND WARMEDMY HEART WHO WAS SO GENTLE YET SO GAY VICTOR HE IS MURDEREDI WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO CONSOLE YOU BUT WILL SIMPLY RELATE THECIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TRANSACTION.LAST THURSDAY MAY TH I MY NIECE AND YOUR TWO BROTHERS WENT TOWALK IN PLAINPALAIS. THE EVENING WAS WARM AND SERENE AND WE PROLONGEDOUR WALK FARTHER THAN USUAL. IT WAS ALREADY DUSK BEFORE WE THOUGHT OFRETURNING AND THEN WE DISCOVERED THAT WILLIAM AND ERNEST WHO HAD GONEON BEFORE WERE NOT TO BE FOUND. WE ACCORDINGLY RESTED ON A SEAT UNTILTHEY SHOULD RETURN. PRESENTLY ERNEST CAME AND ENQUIRED IF WE HAD SEENHIS BROTHER HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN PLAYING WITH HIM THAT WILLIAMHAD RUN AWAY TO HIDE HIMSELF AND THAT HE VAINLY SOUGHT FOR HIM ANDAFTERWARDS WAITED FOR A LONG TIME BUT THAT HE DID NOT RETURN.THIS ACCOUNT RATHER ALARMED US AND WE CONTINUED TO SEARCH FOR HIMUNTIL NIGHT FELL WHEN ELIZABETH CONJECTURED THAT HE MIGHT HAVERETURNED TO THE HOUSE. HE WAS NOT THERE. WE RETURNED AGAIN WITHTORCHES FOR I COULD NOT REST WHEN I THOUGHT THAT MY SWEET BOY HADLOST HIMSELF AND WAS EXPOSED TO ALL THE DAMPS AND DEWS OF NIGHTELIZABETH ALSO SUFFERED EXTREME ANGUISH. ABOUT FIVE IN THE MORNING IDISCOVERED MY LOVELY BOY WHOM THE NIGHT BEFORE I HAD SEEN BLOOMING ANDACTIVE IN HEALTH STRETCHED ON THE GRASS LIVID AND MOTIONLESS THEPRINT OF THE MURDERS FINGER WAS ON HIS NECK.HE WAS CONVEYED HOME AND THE ANGUISH THAT WAS VISIBLE IN MYCOUNTENANCE BETRAYED THE SECRET TO ELIZABETH. SHE WAS VERY EARNEST TOSEE THE CORPSE. AT FIRST I ATTEMPTED TO PREVENT HER BUT SHE PERSISTEDAND ENTERING THE ROOM WHERE IT LAY HASTILY EXAMINED THE NECK OF THEVICTIM AND CLASPING HER HANDS EXCLAIMED O GOD I HAVE MURDERED MYDARLING CHILDSHE FAINTED AND WAS RESTORED WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY. WHEN SHE AGAINLIVED IT WAS ONLY TO WEEP AND SIGH. SHE TOLD ME THAT THAT SAMEEVENING WILLIAM HAD TEASED HER TO LET HIM WEAR A VERY VALUABLEMINIATURE THAT SHE POSSESSED OF YOUR MOTHER. THIS PICTURE IS GONE ANDWAS DOUBTLESS THE TEMPTATION WHICH URGED THE MURDERER TO THE DEED. WEHAVE NO TRACE OF HIM AT PRESENT ALTHOUGH OUR EXERTIONS TO DISCOVER HIMARE UNREMITTED BUT THEY WILL NOT RESTORE MY BELOVED WILLIAMCOME DEAREST VICTOR YOU ALONE CAN CONSOLE ELIZABETH.

ENTER THE HOUSE OF MOURNING MYFRIEND BUT WITH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION FOR THOSE WHO LOVE YOU AND NOTWITH HATRED FOR YOUR ENEMIES.YOUR AFFECTIONATE AND AFFLICTED FATHERALPHONSE FRANKENSTEIN.GENEVA MAY TH .CLERVAL WHO HAD WATCHED MY COUNTENANCE AS I READ THIS LETTER WASSURPRISED TO OBSERVE THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEEDED THE JOY I AT FIRSTEXPRESSED ON RECEIVING NEW FROM MY FRIENDS. I THREW THE LETTER ON THETABLE AND COVERED MY FACE WITH MY HANDS.MY DEAR FRANKENSTEIN EXCLAIMED HENRY WHEN HE PERCEIVED MEWEEP WITH BITTERNESS ARE YOU ALWAYS TO BE UNHAPPY MY DEAR FRIENDWHAT HAS HAPPENEDI MOTIONED HIM TO TAKE UP THE LETTER WHILE I WALKED UP AND DOWN THEROOM IN THE EXTREMEST AGITATION. TEARS ALSO GUSHED FROM THE EYES OFCLERVAL AS HE READ THE ACCOUNT OF MY MISFORTUNE.I CAN OFFER YOU NO CONSOLATION MY FRIEND SAID HEYOUR DISASTER IS IRREPARABLE. WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DOTO GO INSTANTLY TO GENEVA COME WITH ME HENRY TO ORDER THE HORSES.DURING OUR WALK CLERVAL ENDEAVOURED TO SAY A FEW WORDS OF CONSOLATIONHE COULD ONLY EXPRESS HIS HEARTFELT SYMPATHY. POOR WILLIAM SAID HEDEAR LOVELY CHILD HE NOW SLEEPS WITH HIS ANGEL MOTHER WHO THAT HADSEEN HIM BRIGHT AND JOYOUS IN HIS YOUNG BEAUTY BUT MUST WEEP OVER HISUNTIMELY LOSS TO DIE SO MISERABLY TO FEEL THE MURDERERS GRASP HOWMUCH MORE A MURDERED THAT COULD DESTROY RADIANT INNOCENCE POOR LITTLEFELLOW ONE ONLY CONSOLATION HAVE WE HIS FRIENDS MOURN AND WEEP BUTHE IS AT REST. THE PANG IS OVER HIS SUFFERINGS ARE AT AN END FOR EVER.A SOD COVERS HIS GENTLE FORM AND HE KNOWS NO PAIN. HE CAN NO LONGERBE A SUBJECT FOR PITY WE MUST RESERVE THAT FOR HIS MISERABLESURVIVORS.CLERVAL SPOKE THUS AS WE HURRIED THROUGH THE STREETS THE WORDSIMPRESSED THEMSELVES ON MY MIND AND I REMEMBERED THEM AFTERWARDS INSOLITUDE. BUT NOW AS SOON AS THE HORSES ARRIVED I HURRIED INTO ACABRIOLET AND BADE FAREWELL TO MY FRIEND.MY JOURNEY WAS VERY MELANCHOLY. AT FIRST I WISHED TO HURRY ON FOR I LONGEDTO CONSOLE AND SYMPATHISE WITH MY LOVED AND SORROWING FRIENDS BUT WHEN IDREW NEAR MY NATIVE TOWN I SLACKENED MY PROGRESS. I COULD HARDLY SUSTAINTHE MULTITUDE OF FEELINGS THAT CROWDED INTO MY MIND. I PASSED THROUGHSCENES FAMILIAR TO MY YOUTH BUT WHICH I HAD NOT SEEN FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS.HOW ALTERED EVERY THING MIGHT BE DURING THAT TIME ONE SUDDEN ANDDESOLATING CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE BUT A THOUSAND LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCESMIGHT HAVE BY DEGREES WORKED OTHER ALTERATIONS WHICH ALTHOUGH THEY WEREDONE MORE TRANQUILLY MIGHT NOT BE THE LESS DECISIVE. FEAR OVERCAME ME IDARED NO ADVANCE DREADING A THOUSAND NAMELESS EVILS THAT MADE ME TREMBLEALTHOUGH I WAS UNABLE TO DEFINE THEM.I REMAINED TWO DAYS AT LAUSANNE IN THIS PAINFUL STATE OF MIND. ICONTEMPLATED THE LAKE THE WATERS WERE PLACID ALL AROUND WAS CALM AND THESNOWY MOUNTAINS THE PALACES OF NATURE WERE NOT CHANGED. BYDEGREES THE CALM AND HEAVENLY SCENE RESTORED ME AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEYTOWARDS GENEVA.THE ROAD RAN BY THE SIDE OF THE LAKE WHICH BECAME NARROWER AS IAPPROACHED MY NATIVE TOWN. I DISCOVERED MORE DISTINCTLY THE BLACKSIDES OF JURA AND THE BRIGHT SUMMIT OF MONT BLANC. I WEPT LIKE ACHILD. DEAR MOUNTAINS MY OWN BEAUTIFUL LAKE HOW DO YOU WELCOME YOURWANDERER YOUR SUMMITS ARE CLEAR THE SKY AND LAKE ARE BLUE ANDPLACID. IS THIS TO PROGNOSTICATE PEACE OR TO MOCK AT MY UNHAPPINESSI FEAR MY FRIEND THAT I SHALL RENDER MYSELF TEDIOUS BY DWELLING ONTHESE PRELIMINARY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY WERE DAYS OF COMPARATIVEHAPPINESS AND I THINK OF THEM WITH PLEASURE. MY COUNTRY MY BELOVEDCOUNTRY WHO BUT A NATIVE CAN TELL THE DELIGHT I TOOK IN AGAINBEHOLDING THY STREAMS THY MOUNTAINS AND MORE THAN ALL THY LOVELYLAKEYET AS I DREW NEARER HOME GRIEF AND FEAR AGAIN OVERCAME ME. NIGHT ALSOCLOSED AROUND AND WHEN I COULD HARDLY SEE THE DARK MOUNTAINS I FELT STILLMORE GLOOMILY. THE PICTURE APPEARED A VAST AND DIM SCENE OF EVIL AND IFORESAW OBSCURELY THAT I WAS DESTINED TO BECOME THE MOST WRETCHED OF HUMANBEINGS. ALAS I PROPHESIED TRULY AND FAILED ONLY IN ONE SINGLECIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN ALL THE MISERY I IMAGINED AND DREADED I DID NOTCONCEIVE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF THE ANGUISH I WAS DESTINED TO ENDURE.IT WAS COMPLETELY DARK WHEN I ARRIVED IN THE ENVIRONS OF GENEVA THE GATESOF THE TOWN WERE ALREADY SHUT AND I WAS OBLIGED TO PASS THE NIGHT ATSECHERON A VILLAGE AT THE DISTANCE OF HALF A LEAGUE FROM THE CITY. THE SKYWAS SERENE AND AS I WAS UNABLE TO REST I RESOLVED TO VISIT THE SPOTWHERE MY POOR WILLIAM HAD BEEN MURDERED. AS I COULD NOT PASS THROUGH THETOWN I WAS OBLIGED TO CROSS THE LAKE IN A BOAT TO ARRIVE AT PLAINPALAIS.DURING THIS SHORT VOYAGE I SAW THE LIGHTNING PLAYING ON THE SUMMIT OF MONTBLANC IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FIGURES. THE STORM APPEARED TO APPROACHRAPIDLY AND ON LANDING I ASCENDED A LOW HILL THAT I MIGHT OBSERVE ITSPROGRESS. IT ADVANCED THE HEAVENS WERE CLOUDED AND I SOON FELT THE RAINCOMING SLOWLY IN LARGE DROPS BUT ITS VIOLENCE QUICKLY INCREASED.I QUITTED MY SEAT AND WALKED ON ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS AND STORMINCREASED EVERY MINUTE AND THE THUNDER BURST WITH A TERRIFIC CRASHOVER MY HEAD. IT WAS ECHOED FROM SALVE THE JURAS AND THE ALPS OFSAVOY VIVID FLASHES OF LIGHTNING DAZZLED MY EYES ILLUMINATING THELAKE MAKING IT APPEAR LIKE A VAST SHEET OF FIRE THEN FOR AN INSTANTEVERY THING SEEMED OF A PITCHY DARKNESS UNTIL THE EYE RECOVERED ITSELFFROM THE PRECEDING FLASH. THE STORM AS IS OFTEN THE CASE INSWITZERLAND APPEARED AT ONCE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE HEAVENS. THEMOST VIOLENT STORM HUNG EXACTLY NORTH OF THE TOWN OVER THE PART OF THELAKE WHICH LIES BETWEEN THE PROMONTORY OF BELRIVE AND THE VILLAGE OFCOPT. ANOTHER STORM ENLIGHTENED JURA WITH FAINT FLASHES AND ANOTHERDARKENED AND SOMETIMES DISCLOSED THE MLE A PEAKED MOUNTAIN TO THEEAST OF THE LAKE.WHILE I WATCHED THE TEMPEST SO BEAUTIFUL YET TERRIFIC I WANDERED ON WITHA HASTY STEP. THIS NOBLE WAR IN THE SKY ELEVATED MY SPIRITS I CLASPED MYHANDS AND EXCLAIMED ALOUD WILLIAM DEAR ANGEL THIS IS THYFUNERAL THIS THY DIRGE AS I SAID THESE WORDS I PERCEIVED IN THEGLOOM A FIGURE WHICH STOLE FROM BEHIND A CLUMP OF TREES NEAR ME I STOODFIXED GAZING INTENTLY I COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN. A FLASH OF LIGHTNINGILLUMINATED THE OBJECT AND DISCOVERED ITS SHAPE PLAINLY TO ME ITSGIGANTIC STATURE AND THE DEFORMITY OF ITS ASPECT MORE HIDEOUS THAN BELONGSTO HUMANITY INSTANTLY INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS THE WRETCH THE FILTHYDMON TO WHOM I HAD GIVEN LIFE. WHAT DID HE THERE COULD HE BE ISHUDDERED AT THE CONCEPTION THE MURDERER OF MY BROTHER NO SOONER DID THATIDEA CROSS MY IMAGINATION THAN I BECAME CONVINCED OF ITS TRUTH MY TEETHCHATTERED AND I WAS FORCED TO LEAN AGAINST A TREE FOR SUPPORT. THE FIGUREPASSED ME QUICKLY AND I LOST IT IN THE GLOOM. NOTHING IN HUMAN SHAPE COULDHAVE DESTROYED THE FAIR CHILD. HE WAS THE MURDERER I COULD NOTDOUBT IT. THE MERE PRESENCE OF THE IDEA WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF THEFACT. I THOUGHT OF PURSUING THE DEVIL BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VAIN FORANOTHER FLASH DISCOVERED HIM TO ME HANGING AMONG THE ROCKS OF THE NEARLYPERPENDICULAR ASCENT OF MONT SALVE A HILL THAT BOUNDS PLAINPALAIS ON THESOUTH. HE SOON REACHED THE SUMMIT AND DISAPPEARED.I REMAINED MOTIONLESS. THE THUNDER CEASED BUT THE RAIN STILLCONTINUED AND THE SCENE WAS ENVELOPED IN AN IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS. IREVOLVED IN MY MIND THE EVENTS WHICH I HAD UNTIL NOW SOUGHT TO FORGETTHE WHOLE TRAIN OF MY PROGRESS TOWARD THE CREATION THE APPEARANCE OFTHE WORKS OF MY OWN HANDS AT MY BEDSIDE ITS DEPARTURE. TWO YEARS HADNOW NEARLY ELAPSED SINCE THE NIGHT ON WHICH HE FIRST RECEIVED LIFE ANDWAS THIS HIS FIRST CRIME ALAS I HAD TURNED LOOSE INTO THE WORLD ADEPRAVED WRETCH WHOSE DELIGHT WAS IN CARNAGE AND MISERY HAD HE NOTMURDERED MY BROTHERNO ONE CAN CONCEIVE THE ANGUISH I SUFFERED DURING THE REMAINDER OF THENIGHT WHICH I SPENT COLD AND WET IN THE OPEN AIR. BUT I DID NOTFEEL THE INCONVENIENCE OF THE WEATHER MY IMAGINATION WAS BUSY INSCENES OF EVIL AND DESPAIR. I CONSIDERED THE BEING WHOM I HAD CASTAMONG MANKIND AND ENDOWED WITH THE WILL AND POWER TO EFFECT PURPOSESOF HORROR SUCH AS THE DEED WHICH HE HAD NOW DONE NEARLY IN THE LIGHTOF MY OWN VAMPIRE MY OWN SPIRIT LET LOOSE FROM THE GRAVE AND FORCEDTO DESTROY ALL THAT WAS DEAR TO ME.DAY DAWNED AND I DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARDS THE TOWN. THE GATES WEREOPEN AND I HASTENED TO MY FATHERS HOUSE. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TODISCOVER WHAT I KNEW OF THE MURDERER AND CAUSE INSTANT PURSUIT TO BEMADE. BUT I PAUSED WHEN I REFLECTED ON THE STORY THAT I HAD TO TELL. ABEING WHOM I MYSELF HAD FORMED AND ENDUED WITH LIFE HAD MET ME ATMIDNIGHT AMONG THE PRECIPICES OF AN INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAIN. IREMEMBERED ALSO THE NERVOUS FEVER WITH WHICH I HAD BEEN SEIZED JUST ATTHE TIME THAT I DATED MY CREATION AND WHICH WOULD GIVE AN AIR OFDELIRIUM TO A TALE OTHERWISE SO UTTERLY IMPROBABLE. I WELL KNEW THATIF ANY OTHER HAD COMMUNICATED SUCH A RELATION TO ME I SHOULD HAVELOOKED UPON IT AS THE RAVINGS OF INSANITY. BESIDES THE STRANGE NATUREOF THE ANIMAL WOULD ELUDE ALL PURSUIT EVEN IF I WERE SO FAR CREDITEDAS TO PERSUADE MY RELATIVES TO COMMENCE IT. AND THEN OF WHAT USE WOULDBE PURSUIT WHO COULD ARREST A CREATURE CAPABLE OF SCALING THEOVERHANGING SIDES OF MONT SALVE THESE REFLECTIONS DETERMINED ME ANDI RESOLVED TO REMAIN SILENT.IT WAS ABOUT FIVE IN THE MORNING WHEN I ENTERED MY FATHERS HOUSE. ITOLD THE SERVANTS NOT TO DISTURB THE FAMILY AND WENT INTO THE LIBRARYTO ATTEND THEIR USUAL HOUR OF RISING.SIX YEARS HAD ELAPSED PASSED IN A DREAM BUT FOR ONE INDELIBLE TRACE AND ISTOOD IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE I HAD LAST EMBRACED MY FATHER BEFORE MYDEPARTURE FOR INGOLSTADT. BELOVED AND VENERABLE PARENT HE STILL REMAINEDTO ME. I GAZED ON THE PICTURE OF MY MOTHER WHICH STOOD OVER THEMANTELPIECE. IT WAS AN HISTORICAL SUBJECT PAINTED AT MY FATHERSDESIRE AND REPRESENTED CAROLINE BEAUFORT IN AN AGONY OF DESPAIR KNEELINGBY THE COFFIN OF HER DEAD FATHER. HER GARB WAS RUSTIC AND HER CHEEK PALEBUT THERE WAS AN AIR OF DIGNITY AND BEAUTY THAT HARDLY PERMITTED THESENTIMENT OF PITY. BELOW THIS PICTURE WAS A MINIATURE OF WILLIAM AND MYTEARS FLOWED WHEN I LOOKED UPON IT. WHILE I WAS THUS ENGAGED ERNESTENTERED HE HAD HEARD ME ARRIVE AND HASTENED TO WELCOME MEWELCOME MY DEAREST VICTOR SAID HE. AH I WISH YOUHAD COME THREE MONTHS AGO AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND US ALL JOYOUS ANDDELIGHTED. YOU COME TO US NOW TO SHARE A MISERY WHICH NOTHING CANALLEVIATE YET YOUR PRESENCE WILL I HOPE REVIVE OUR FATHER WHO SEEMSSINKING UNDER HIS MISFORTUNE AND YOUR PERSUASIONS WILL INDUCE POORELIZABETH TO CEASE HER VAIN AND TORMENTING SELFACCUSATIONS.POORWILLIAM HE WAS OUR DARLING AND OUR PRIDETEARS UNRESTRAINED FELL FROM MY BROTHERS EYES A SENSE OF MORTALAGONY CREPT OVER MY FRAME. BEFORE I HAD ONLY IMAGINED THEWRETCHEDNESS OF MY DESOLATED HOME THE REALITY CAME ON ME AS A NEW ANDA NOT LESS TERRIBLE DISASTER. I TRIED TO CALM ERNEST I ENQUIRED MOREMINUTELY CONCERNING MY FATHER AND HERE I NAMED MY COUSIN.SHE MOST OF ALL SAID ERNEST REQUIRES CONSOLATION SHE ACCUSEDHERSELF OF HAVING CAUSED THE DEATH OF MY BROTHER AND THAT MADE HERVERY WRETCHED. BUT SINCE THE MURDERER HAS BEEN DISCOVEREDTHE MURDERER DISCOVERED GOOD GOD HOW CAN THAT BE WHO COULD ATTEMPTTO PURSUE HIM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE ONE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO OVERTAKE THEWINDS OR CONFINE A MOUNTAINSTREAM WITH A STRAW. I SAW HIM TOO HEWAS FREE LAST NIGHTI DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN REPLIED MY BROTHER IN ACCENTS OFWONDER BUT TO US THE DISCOVERY WE HAVE MADE COMPLETES OUR MISERY. NOONE WOULD BELIEVE IT AT FIRST AND EVEN NOW ELIZABETH WILL NOT BECONVINCED NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE EVIDENCE. INDEED WHO WOULD CREDITTHAT JUSTINE MORITZ WHO WAS SO AMIABLE AND FOND OF ALL THE FAMILYCOULD SUDDENLY BECOME SO CAPABLE OF SO FRIGHTFUL SO APPALLING A CRIMEJUSTINE MORITZ POOR POOR GIRL IS SHE THE ACCUSED BUT IT ISWRONGFULLY EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT NO ONE BELIEVES IT SURELY ERNESTNO ONE DID AT FIRST BUT SEVERAL CIRCUMSTANCES CAME OUT THAT HAVEALMOST FORCED CONVICTION UPON US AND HER OWN BEHAVIOUR HAS BEEN SOCONFUSED AS TO ADD TO THE EVIDENCE OF FACTS A WEIGHT THAT I FEARLEAVES NO HOPE FOR DOUBT. BUT SHE WILL BE TRIED TODAY AND YOU WILLTHEN HEAR ALL.HE THEN RELATED THAT THE MORNING ON WHICH THE MURDER OF POOR WILLIAMHAD BEEN DISCOVERED JUSTINE HAD BEEN TAKEN ILL AND CONFINED TO HERBED FOR SEVERAL DAYS. DURING THIS INTERVAL ONE OF THE SERVANTSHAPPENING TO EXAMINE THE APPAREL SHE HAD WORN ON THE NIGHT OF THEMURDER HAD DISCOVERED IN HER POCKET THE PICTURE OF MY MOTHER WHICHHAD BEEN JUDGED TO BE THE TEMPTATION OF THE MURDERER. THE SERVANTINSTANTLY SHOWED IT TO ONE OF THE OTHERS WHO WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TOANY OF THE FAMILY WENT TO A MAGISTRATE AND UPON THEIR DEPOSITIONJUSTINE WAS APPREHENDED. ON BEING CHARGED WITH THE FACT THE POOR GIRLCONFIRMED THE SUSPICION IN A GREAT MEASURE BY HER EXTREME CONFUSION OFMANNER.THIS WAS A STRANGE TALE BUT IT DID NOT SHAKE MY FAITH AND I REPLIEDEARNESTLY YOU ARE ALL MISTAKEN I KNOW THE MURDERER. JUSTINE POORGOOD JUSTINE IS INNOCENT.AT THAT INSTANT MY FATHER ENTERED. I SAW UNHAPPINESS DEEPLY IMPRESSEDON HIS COUNTENANCE BUT HE ENDEAVOURED TO WELCOME ME CHEERFULLY ANDAFTER WE HAD EXCHANGED OUR MOURNFUL GREETING WOULD HAVE INTRODUCEDSOME OTHER TOPIC THAN THAT OF OUR DISASTER HAD NOT ERNEST EXCLAIMEDGOOD GOD PAPA VICTOR SAYS THAT HE KNOWS WHO WAS THE MURDERER OFPOOR WILLIAM.WE DO ALSO UNFORTUNATELY REPLIED MY FATHER FOR INDEED I HADRATHER HAVE BEEN FOR EVER IGNORANT THAN HAVE DISCOVERED SO MUCHDEPRAVITY AND UNGRATITUDE IN ONE I VALUED SO HIGHLY.MY DEAR FATHER YOU ARE MISTAKEN JUSTINE IS INNOCENT.IF SHE IS GOD FORBID THAT SHE SHOULD SUFFER AS GUILTY. SHE IS TO BETRIED TODAY AND I HOPE I SINCERELY HOPE THAT SHE WILL BE ACQUITTED.THIS SPEECH CALMED ME. I WAS FIRMLY CONVINCED IN MY OWN MIND THATJUSTINE AND INDEED EVERY HUMAN BEING WAS GUILTLESS OF THIS MURDER. IHAD NO FEAR THEREFORE THAT ANY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE COULD BEBROUGHT FORWARD STRONG ENOUGH TO CONVICT HER. MY TALE WAS NOT ONE TOANNOUNCE PUBLICLY ITS ASTOUNDING HORROR WOULD BE LOOKED UPON ASMADNESS BY THE VULGAR. DID ANY ONE INDEED EXIST EXCEPT I THECREATOR WHO WOULD BELIEVE UNLESS HIS SENSES CONVINCED HIM IN THEEXISTENCE OF THE LIVING MONUMENT OF PRESUMPTION AND RASH IGNORANCEWHICH I HAD LET LOOSE UPON THE WORLDWE WERE SOON JOINED BY ELIZABETH. TIME HAD ALTERED HER SINCE I LASTBEHELD HER IT HAD ENDOWED HER WITH LOVELINESS SURPASSING THE BEAUTY OFHER CHILDISH YEARS. THERE WAS THE SAME CANDOUR THE SAME VIVACITY BUTIT WAS ALLIED TO AN EXPRESSION MORE FULL OF SENSIBILITY AND INTELLECT.SHE WELCOMED ME WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION. YOUR ARRIVAL MY DEARCOUSIN SAID SHE FILLS ME WITH HOPE. YOU PERHAPS WILL FIND SOMEMEANS TO JUSTIFY MY POOR GUILTLESS JUSTINE. ALAS WHO IS SAFE IF SHEBE CONVICTED OF CRIME I RELY ON HER INNOCENCE AS CERTAINLY AS I DOUPON MY OWN. OUR MISFORTUNE IS DOUBLY HARD TO US WE HAVE NOT ONLYLOST THAT LOVELY DARLING BOY BUT THIS POOR GIRL WHOM I SINCERELYLOVE IS TO BE TORN AWAY BY EVEN A WORSE FATE. IF SHE IS CONDEMNED INEVER SHALL KNOW JOY MORE. BUT SHE WILL NOT I AM SURE SHE WILL NOTAND THEN I SHALL BE HAPPY AGAIN EVEN AFTER THE SAD DEATH OF MY LITTLEWILLIAM.SHE IS INNOCENT MY ELIZABETH SAID I AND THAT SHALLBE PROVED FEAR NOTHING BUT LET YOUR SPIRITS BE CHEERED BY THE ASSURANCEOF HER ACQUITTAL.HOW KIND AND GENEROUS YOU ARE EVERY ONE ELSE BELIEVES IN HER GUILTAND THAT MADE ME WRETCHED FOR I KNEW THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND TOSEE EVERY ONE ELSE PREJUDICED IN SO DEADLY A MANNER RENDERED MEHOPELESS AND DESPAIRING. SHE WEPT.DEAREST NIECE SAID MY FATHER DRY YOUR TEARS. IF SHEIS AS YOU BELIEVE INNOCENT RELY ON THE JUSTICE OF OUR LAWS AND THEACTIVITY WITH WHICH I SHALL PREVENT THE SLIGHTEST SHADOW OFPARTIALITY.CHAPTER WE PASSED A FEW SAD HOURS UNTIL ELEVEN OCLOCK WHEN THE TRIAL WAS TOCOMMENCE. MY FATHER AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY BEING OBLIGED TO ATTENDAS WITNESSES I ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE COURT. DURING THE WHOLE OFTHIS WRETCHED MOCKERY OF JUSTICE I SUFFERED LIVING TORTURE. IT WAS TOBE DECIDED WHETHER THE RESULT OF MY CURIOSITY AND LAWLESS DEVICES WOULDCAUSE THE DEATH OF TWO OF MY FELLOW BEINGS ONE A SMILING BABE FULL OFINNOCENCE AND JOY THE OTHER FAR MORE DREADFULLY MURDERED WITH EVERYAGGRAVATION OF INFAMY THAT COULD MAKE THE MURDER MEMORABLE IN HORROR.JUSTINE ALSO WAS A GIRL OF MERIT AND POSSESSED QUALITIES WHICH PROMISEDTO RENDER HER LIFE HAPPY NOW ALL WAS TO BE OBLITERATED IN ANIGNOMINIOUS GRAVE AND I THE CAUSE A THOUSAND TIMES RATHER WOULD IHAVE CONFESSED MYSELF GUILTY OF THE CRIME ASCRIBED TO JUSTINE BUT IWAS ABSENT WHEN IT WAS COMMITTED AND SUCH A DECLARATION WOULD HAVEBEEN CONSIDERED AS THE RAVINGS OF A MADMAN AND WOULD NOT HAVEEXCULPATED HER WHO SUFFERED THROUGH ME.THE APPEARANCE OF JUSTINE WAS CALM. SHE WAS DRESSED IN MOURNING ANDHER COUNTENANCE ALWAYS ENGAGING WAS RENDERED BY THE SOLEMNITY OF HERFEELINGS EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL. YET SHE APPEARED CONFIDENT ININNOCENCE AND DID NOT TREMBLE ALTHOUGH GAZED ON AND EXECRATED BYTHOUSANDS FOR ALL THE KINDNESS WHICH HER BEAUTY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVEEXCITED WAS OBLITERATED IN THE MINDS OF THE SPECTATORS BY THEIMAGINATION OF THE ENORMITY SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE COMMITTED. SHEWAS TRANQUIL YET HER TRANQUILLITY WAS EVIDENTLY CONSTRAINED AND ASHER CONFUSION HAD BEFORE BEEN ADDUCED AS A PROOF OF HER GUILT SHEWORKED UP HER MIND TO AN APPEARANCE OF COURAGE. WHEN SHE ENTERED THECOURT SHE THREW HER EYES ROUND IT AND QUICKLY DISCOVERED WHERE WE WERESEATED. A TEAR SEEMED TO DIM HER EYE WHEN SHE SAW US BUT SHE QUICKLYRECOVERED HERSELF AND A LOOK OF SORROWFUL AFFECTION SEEMED TO ATTESTHER UTTER GUILTLESSNESS.THE TRIAL BEGAN AND AFTER THE ADVOCATE AGAINST HER HAD STATED THECHARGE SEVERAL WITNESSES WERE CALLED. SEVERAL STRANGE FACTS COMBINEDAGAINST HER WHICH MIGHT HAVE STAGGERED ANYONE WHO HAD NOT SUCH PROOFOF HER INNOCENCE AS I HAD. SHE HAD BEEN OUT THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT ONWHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AND TOWARDS MORNING HAD BEENPERCEIVED BY A MARKETWOMAN NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE BODY OF THEMURDERED CHILD HAD BEEN AFTERWARDS FOUND. THE WOMAN ASKED HER WHAT SHEDID THERE BUT SHE LOOKED VERY STRANGELY AND ONLY RETURNED A CONFUSEDAND UNINTELLIGIBLE ANSWER. SHE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE ABOUT EIGHTOCLOCK AND WHEN ONE INQUIRED WHERE SHE HAD PASSED THE NIGHT SHEREPLIED THAT SHE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THE CHILD AND DEMANDED EARNESTLYIF ANYTHING HAD BEEN HEARD CONCERNING HIM. WHEN SHOWN THE BODY SHEFELL INTO VIOLENT HYSTERICS AND KEPT HER BED FOR SEVERAL DAYS. THEPICTURE WAS THEN PRODUCED WHICH THE SERVANT HAD FOUND IN HER POCKETAND WHEN ELIZABETH IN A FALTERING VOICE PROVED THAT IT WAS THE SAMEWHICH AN HOUR BEFORE THE CHILD HAD BEEN MISSED SHE HAD PLACED ROUNDHIS NECK A MURMUR OF HORROR AND INDIGNATION FILLED THE COURT.JUSTINE WAS CALLED ON FOR HER DEFENCE. AS THE TRIAL HAD PROCEEDED HERCOUNTENANCE HAD ALTERED. SURPRISE HORROR AND MISERY WERE STRONGLYEXPRESSED. SOMETIMES SHE STRUGGLED WITH HER TEARS BUT WHEN SHE WASDESIRED TO PLEAD SHE COLLECTED HER POWERS AND SPOKE IN AN AUDIBLEALTHOUGH VARIABLE VOICE.GOD KNOWS SHE SAID HOW ENTIRELY I AM INNOCENT. BUT IDO NOT PRETEND THAT MY PROTESTATIONS SHOULD ACQUIT ME I REST MY INNOCENCEON A PLAIN AND SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF THE FACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDUCEDAGAINST ME AND I HOPE THE CHARACTER I HAVE ALWAYS BORNE WILL INCLINE MYJUDGES TO A FAVOURABLE INTERPRETATION WHERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCE APPEARSDOUBTFUL OR SUSPICIOUS.SHE THEN RELATED THAT BY THE PERMISSION OF ELIZABETH SHE HAD PASSEDTHE EVENING OF THE NIGHT ON WHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AT THEHOUSE OF AN AUNT AT CHNE A VILLAGE SITUATED AT ABOUT A LEAGUE FROMGENEVA. ON HER RETURN AT ABOUT NINE OCLOCK SHE MET A MAN WHO ASKEDHER IF SHE HAD SEEN ANYTHING OF THE CHILD WHO WAS LOST. SHE WASALARMED BY THIS ACCOUNT AND PASSED SEVERAL HOURS IN LOOKING FOR HIMWHEN THE GATES OF GENEVA WERE SHUT AND SHE WAS FORCED TO REMAINSEVERAL HOURS OF THE NIGHT IN A BARN BELONGING TO A COTTAGE BEINGUNWILLING TO CALL UP THE INHABITANTS TO WHOM SHE WAS WELL KNOWN. MOSTOF THE NIGHT SHE SPENT HERE WATCHING TOWARDS MORNING SHE BELIEVED THATSHE SLEPT FOR A FEW MINUTES SOME STEPS DISTURBED HER AND SHE AWOKE.IT WAS DAWN AND SHE QUITTED HER ASYLUM THAT SHE MIGHT AGAIN ENDEAVOURTO FIND MY BROTHER. IF SHE HAD GONE NEAR THE SPOT WHERE HIS BODY LAYIT WAS WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE. THAT SHE HAD BEEN BEWILDERED WHENQUESTIONED BY THE MARKETWOMAN WAS NOT SURPRISING SINCE SHE HAD PASSEDA SLEEPLESS NIGHT AND THE FATE OF POOR WILLIAM WAS YET UNCERTAIN.CONCERNING THE PICTURE SHE COULD GIVE NO ACCOUNT.I KNOW CONTINUED THE UNHAPPY VICTIM HOW HEAVILY ANDFATALLY THIS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE WEIGHS AGAINST ME BUT I HAVE NO POWER OFEXPLAINING IT AND WHEN I HAVE EXPRESSED MY UTTER IGNORANCE I AM ONLY LEFTTO CONJECTURE CONCERNING THE PROBABILITIES BY WHICH IT MIGHT HAVE BEENPLACED IN MY POCKET. BUT HERE ALSO I AM CHECKED. I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NOENEMY ON EARTH AND NONE SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN SO WICKED AS TO DESTROY MEWANTONLY. DID THE MURDERER PLACE IT THERE I KNOW OF NO OPPORTUNITYAFFORDED HIM FOR SO DOING OR IF I HAD WHY SHOULD HE HAVE STOLEN THEJEWEL TO PART WITH IT AGAIN SO SOONI COMMIT MY CAUSE TO THE JUSTICE OF MY JUDGES YET I SEE NO ROOM FORHOPE. I BEG PERMISSION TO HAVE A FEW WITNESSES EXAMINED CONCERNING MYCHARACTER AND IF THEIR TESTIMONY SHALL NOT OVERWEIGH MY SUPPOSEDGUILT I MUST BE CONDEMNED ALTHOUGH I WOULD PLEDGE MY SALVATION ON MYINNOCENCE.SEVERAL WITNESSES WERE CALLED WHO HAD KNOWN HER FOR MANY YEARS ANDTHEY SPOKE WELL OF HER BUT FEAR AND HATRED OF THE CRIME OF WHICH THEYSUPPOSED HER GUILTY RENDERED THEM TIMOROUS AND UNWILLING TO COMEFORWARD. ELIZABETH SAW EVEN THIS LAST RESOURCE HER EXCELLENTDISPOSITIONS AND IRREPROACHABLE CONDUCT ABOUT TO FAIL THE ACCUSEDWHEN ALTHOUGH VIOLENTLY AGITATED SHE DESIRED PERMISSION TO ADDRESSTHE COURT.I AM SAID SHE THE COUSIN OF THE UNHAPPY CHILD WHOWAS MURDERED OR RATHER HIS SISTER FOR I WAS EDUCATED BY AND HAVE LIVEDWITH HIS PARENTS EVER SINCE AND EVEN LONG BEFORE HIS BIRTH. IT MAYTHEREFORE BE JUDGED INDECENT IN ME TO COME FORWARD ON THIS OCCASION BUTWHEN I SEE A FELLOW CREATURE ABOUT TO PERISH THROUGH THE COWARDICE OF HERPRETENDED FRIENDS I WISH TO BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK THAT I MAY SAY WHAT IKNOW OF HER CHARACTER. I AM WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ACCUSED. I HAVE LIVEDIN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HER AT ONE TIME FOR FIVE AND AT ANOTHER FOR NEARLYTWO YEARS. DURING ALL THAT PERIOD SHE APPEARED TO ME THE MOST AMIABLE ANDBENEVOLENT OF HUMAN CREATURES. SHE NURSED MADAME FRANKENSTEIN MY AUNT INHER LAST ILLNESS WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION AND CARE AND AFTERWARDSATTENDED HER OWN MOTHER DURING A TEDIOUS ILLNESS IN A MANNER THAT EXCITEDTHE ADMIRATION OF ALL WHO KNEW HER AFTER WHICH SHE AGAIN LIVED IN MYUNCLES HOUSE WHERE SHE WAS BELOVED BY ALL THE FAMILY. SHE WASWARMLY ATTACHED TO THE CHILD WHO IS NOW DEAD AND ACTED TOWARDS HIM LIKE AMOST AFFECTIONATE MOTHER. FOR MY OWN PART I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THATNOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE EVIDENCE PRODUCED AGAINST HER I BELIEVE AND RELYON HER PERFECT INNOCENCE. SHE HAD NO TEMPTATION FOR SUCH AN ACTION AS TOTHE BAUBLE ON WHICH THE CHIEF PROOF RESTS IF SHE HAD EARNESTLY DESIRED ITI SHOULD HAVE WILLINGLY GIVEN IT TO HER SO MUCH DO I ESTEEM AND VALUEHER.A MURMUR OF APPROBATION FOLLOWED ELIZABETHS SIMPLE AND POWERFULAPPEAL BUT IT WAS EXCITED BY HER GENEROUS INTERFERENCE AND NOT INFAVOUR OF POOR JUSTINE ON WHOM THE PUBLIC INDIGNATION WAS TURNED WITHRENEWED VIOLENCE CHARGING HER WITH THE BLACKEST INGRATITUDE. SHEHERSELF WEPT AS ELIZABETH SPOKE BUT SHE DID NOT ANSWER. MY OWNAGITATION AND ANGUISH WAS EXTREME DURING THE WHOLE TRIAL. I BELIEVEDIN HER INNOCENCE I KNEW IT. COULD THE DMON WHO HAD I DID NOT FOR AMINUTE DOUBT MURDERED MY BROTHER ALSO IN HIS HELLISH SPORT HAVEBETRAYED THE INNOCENT TO DEATH AND IGNOMINY I COULD NOT SUSTAIN THEHORROR OF MY SITUATION AND WHEN I PERCEIVED THAT THE POPULAR VOICE ANDTHE COUNTENANCES OF THE JUDGES HAD ALREADY CONDEMNED MY UNHAPPY VICTIMI RUSHED OUT OF THE COURT IN AGONY. THE TORTURES OF THE ACCUSED DIDNOT EQUAL MINE SHE WAS SUSTAINED BY INNOCENCE BUT THE FANGS OFREMORSE TORE MY BOSOM AND WOULD NOT FORGO THEIR HOLD.I PASSED A NIGHT OF UNMINGLED WRETCHEDNESS. IN THE MORNING I WENT TOTHE COURT MY LIPS AND THROAT WERE PARCHED. I DARED NOT ASK THE FATALQUESTION BUT I WAS KNOWN AND THE OFFICER GUESSED THE CAUSE OF MYVISIT. THE BALLOTS HAD BEEN THROWN THEY WERE ALL BLACK AND JUSTINEWAS CONDEMNED.I CANNOT PRETEND TO DESCRIBE WHAT I THEN FELT. I HAD BEFOREEXPERIENCED SENSATIONS OF HORROR AND I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO BESTOW UPONTHEM ADEQUATE EXPRESSIONS BUT WORDS CANNOT CONVEY AN IDEA OF THEHEARTSICKENING DESPAIR THAT I THEN ENDURED. THE PERSON TO WHOM IADDRESSED MYSELF ADDED THAT JUSTINE HAD ALREADY CONFESSED HER GUILT.THAT EVIDENCE HE OBSERVED WAS HARDLY REQUIRED IN SO GLARING ACASE BUT I AM GLAD OF IT AND INDEED NONE OF OUR JUDGES LIKE TOCONDEMN A CRIMINAL UPON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE BE IT EVER SODECISIVE.THIS WAS STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED INTELLIGENCE WHAT COULD IT MEAN HADMY EYES DECEIVED ME AND WAS I REALLY AS MAD AS THE WHOLE WORLD WOULDBELIEVE ME TO BE IF I DISCLOSED THE OBJECT OF MY SUSPICIONS IHASTENED TO RETURN HOME AND ELIZABETH EAGERLY DEMANDED THE RESULT.MY COUSIN REPLIED I IT IS DECIDED AS YOU MAY HAVE EXPECTED ALLJUDGES HAD RATHER THAT TEN INNOCENT SHOULD SUFFER THAN THAT ONE GUILTYSHOULD ESCAPE. BUT SHE HAS CONFESSED.THIS WAS A DIRE BLOW TO POOR ELIZABETH WHO HAD RELIED WITH FIRMNESS UPONJUSTINES INNOCENCE. ALAS SAID SHE. HOW SHALL IEVER AGAIN BELIEVE IN HUMAN GOODNESS JUSTINE WHOM I LOVED AND ESTEEMED ASMY SISTER HOW COULD SHE PUT ON THOSE SMILES OF INNOCENCE ONLY TO BETRAYHER MILD EYES SEEMED INCAPABLE OF ANY SEVERITY OR GUILE AND YET SHE HASCOMMITTED A MURDER.SOON AFTER WE HEARD THAT THE POOR VICTIM HAD EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SEE MYCOUSIN. MY FATHER WISHED HER NOT TO GO BUT SAID THAT HE LEFT IT TO HER OWNJUDGMENT AND FEELINGS TO DECIDE. YES SAID ELIZABETHI WILL GO ALTHOUGH SHE IS GUILTY AND YOU VICTOR SHALL ACCOMPANYME I CANNOT GO ALONE. THE IDEA OF THIS VISIT WAS TORTURE TO ME YETI COULD NOT REFUSE.WE ENTERED THE GLOOMY PRISON CHAMBER AND BEHELD JUSTINE SITTING ON SOMESTRAW AT THE FARTHER END HER HANDS WERE MANACLED AND HER HEAD RESTED ONHER KNEES. SHE ROSE ON SEEING US ENTER AND WHEN WE WERE LEFT ALONE WITHHER SHE THREW HERSELF AT THE FEET OF ELIZABETH WEEPING BITTERLY. MYCOUSIN WEPT ALSO.OH JUSTINE SAID SHE. WHY DID YOU ROB ME OF MY LAST CONSOLATIONI RELIED ON YOUR INNOCENCE AND ALTHOUGH I WAS THEN VERY WRETCHED IWAS NOT SO MISERABLE AS I AM NOW.AND DO YOU ALSO BELIEVE THAT I AM SO VERY VERY WICKED DO YOU ALSOJOIN WITH MY ENEMIES TO CRUSH ME TO CONDEMN ME AS A MURDERER HERVOICE WAS SUFFOCATED WITH SOBS.RISE MY POOR GIRL SAID ELIZABETH WHY DO YOU KNEELIF YOU ARE INNOCENT I AM NOT ONE OF YOUR ENEMIES I BELIEVED YOUGUILTLESS NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY EVIDENCE UNTIL I HEARD THAT YOU HADYOURSELF DECLARED YOUR GUILT. THAT REPORT YOU SAY IS FALSE AND BEASSURED DEAR JUSTINE THAT NOTHING CAN SHAKE MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU FOR AMOMENT BUT YOUR OWN CONFESSION.I DID CONFESS BUT I CONFESSED A LIE. I CONFESSED THAT I MIGHTOBTAIN ABSOLUTION BUT NOW THAT FALSEHOOD LIES HEAVIER AT MY HEART THANALL MY OTHER SINS. THE GOD OF HEAVEN FORGIVE ME EVER SINCE I WASCONDEMNED MY CONFESSOR HAS BESIEGED ME HE THREATENED AND MENACEDUNTIL I ALMOST BEGAN TO THINK THAT I WAS THE MONSTER THAT HE SAID IWAS. HE THREATENED EXCOMMUNICATION AND HELL FIRE IN MY LAST MOMENTS IFI CONTINUED OBDURATE. DEAR LADY I HAD NONE TO SUPPORT ME ALL LOOKEDON ME AS A WRETCH DOOMED TO IGNOMINY AND PERDITION. WHAT COULD I DOIN AN EVIL HOUR I SUBSCRIBED TO A LIE AND NOW ONLY AM I TRULYMISERABLE.SHE PAUSED WEEPING AND THEN CONTINUED I THOUGHT WITH HORROR MYSWEET LADY THAT YOU SHOULD BELIEVE YOUR JUSTINE WHOM YOUR BLESSEDAUNT HAD SO HIGHLY HONOURED AND WHOM YOU LOVED WAS A CREATURE CAPABLEOF A CRIME WHICH NONE BUT THE DEVIL HIMSELF COULD HAVE PERPETRATED.DEAR WILLIAM DEAREST BLESSED CHILD I SOON SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN INHEAVEN WHERE WE SHALL ALL BE HAPPY AND THAT CONSOLES ME GOING AS IAM TO SUFFER IGNOMINY AND DEATH.OH JUSTINE FORGIVE ME FOR HAVING FOR ONE MOMENT DISTRUSTED YOU.WHY DID YOU CONFESS BUT DO NOT MOURN DEAR GIRL. DO NOT FEAR. IWILL PROCLAIM I WILL PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE. I WILL MELT THE STONYHEARTS OF YOUR ENEMIES BY MY TEARS AND PRAYERS. YOU SHALL NOT DIEYOU MY PLAYFELLOW MY COMPANION MY SISTER PERISH ON THE SCAFFOLDNO NO I NEVER COULD SURVIVE SO HORRIBLE A MISFORTUNE.JUSTINE SHOOK HER HEAD MOURNFULLY. I DO NOT FEAR TO DIE SHE SAIDTHAT PANG IS PAST. GOD RAISES MY WEAKNESS AND GIVES ME COURAGE TOENDURE THE WORST. I LEAVE A SAD AND BITTER WORLD AND IF YOU REMEMBERME AND THINK OF ME AS OF ONE UNJUSTLY CONDEMNED I AM RESIGNED TO THEFATE AWAITING ME. LEARN FROM ME DEAR LADY TO SUBMIT IN PATIENCE TOTHE WILL OF HEAVENDURING THIS CONVERSATION I HAD RETIRED TO A CORNER OF THE PRISON ROOMWHERE I COULD CONCEAL THE HORRID ANGUISH THAT POSSESSED ME. DESPAIRWHO DARED TALK OF THAT THE POOR VICTIM WHO ON THE MORROW WAS TO PASSTHE AWFUL BOUNDARY BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FELT NOT AS I DID SUCHDEEP AND BITTER AGONY. I GNASHED MY TEETH AND GROUND THEM TOGETHERUTTERING A GROAN THAT CAME FROM MY INMOST SOUL. JUSTINE STARTED. WHENSHE SAW WHO IT WAS SHE APPROACHED ME AND SAID DEAR SIR YOU ARE VERYKIND TO VISIT ME YOU I HOPE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I AM GUILTYI COULD NOT ANSWER. NO JUSTINE SAID ELIZABETH HE IS MORECONVINCED OF YOUR INNOCENCE THAN I WAS FOR EVEN WHEN HE HEARD THAT YOUHAD CONFESSED HE DID NOT CREDIT IT.I TRULY THANK HIM. IN THESE LAST MOMENTS I FEEL THE SINCERESTGRATITUDE TOWARDS THOSE WHO THINK OF ME WITH KINDNESS. HOW SWEET ISTHE AFFECTION OF OTHERS TO SUCH A WRETCH AS I AM IT REMOVES MORE THANHALF MY MISFORTUNE AND I FEEL AS IF I COULD DIE IN PEACE NOW THAT MYINNOCENCE IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY YOU DEAR LADY AND YOUR COUSIN.THUS THE POOR SUFFERER TRIED TO COMFORT OTHERS AND HERSELF. SHE INDEEDGAINED THE RESIGNATION SHE DESIRED. BUT I THE TRUE MURDERER FELT THENEVERDYING WORM ALIVE IN MY BOSOM WHICH ALLOWED OF NO HOPE ORCONSOLATION. ELIZABETH ALSO WEPT AND WAS UNHAPPY BUT HERS ALSO WASTHE MISERY OF INNOCENCE WHICH LIKE A CLOUD THAT PASSES OVER THE FAIRMOON FOR A WHILE HIDES BUT CANNOT TARNISH ITS BRIGHTNESS. ANGUISH ANDDESPAIR HAD PENETRATED INTO THE CORE OF MY HEART I BORE A HELL WITHINME WHICH NOTHING COULD EXTINGUISH. WE STAYED SEVERAL HOURS WITHJUSTINE AND IT WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT ELIZABETH COULD TEARHERSELF AWAY. I WISH CRIED SHE THAT I WERE TO DIE WITH YOU ICANNOT LIVE IN THIS WORLD OF MISERY.JUSTINE ASSUMED AN AIR OF CHEERFULNESS WHILE SHE WITH DIFFICULTYREPRESSED HER BITTER TEARS. SHE EMBRACED ELIZABETH AND SAID IN A VOICEOF HALFSUPPRESSED EMOTION FAREWELL SWEET LADY DEAREST ELIZABETHMY BELOVED AND ONLY FRIEND MAY HEAVEN IN ITS BOUNTY BLESS ANDPRESERVE YOU MAY THIS BE THE LAST MISFORTUNE THAT YOU WILL EVERSUFFER LIVE AND BE HAPPY AND MAKE OTHERS SO.AND ON THE MORROW JUSTINE DIED. ELIZABETHS HEARTRENDING ELOQUENCEFAILED TO MOVE THE JUDGES FROM THEIR SETTLED CONVICTION IN THECRIMINALITY OF THE SAINTLY SUFFERER. MY PASSIONATE AND INDIGNANTAPPEALS WERE LOST UPON THEM. AND WHEN I RECEIVED THEIR COLD ANSWERSAND HEARD THE HARSH UNFEELING REASONING OF THESE MEN MY PURPOSEDAVOWAL DIED AWAY ON MY LIPS. THUS I MIGHT PROCLAIM MYSELF A MADMANBUT NOT REVOKE THE SENTENCE PASSED UPON MY WRETCHED VICTIM. SHEPERISHED ON THE SCAFFOLD AS A MURDERESSFROM THE TORTURES OF MY OWN HEART I TURNED TO CONTEMPLATE THE DEEP ANDVOICELESS GRIEF OF MY ELIZABETH.

JUSTINE DIED SHE RESTED AND I WAS ALIVE. THE BLOOD FLOWEDFREELY IN MY VEINS BUT A WEIGHT OF DESPAIR AND REMORSE PRESSED ON MYHEART WHICH NOTHING COULD REMOVE. SLEEP FLED FROM MY EYES I WANDEREDLIKE AN EVIL SPIRIT FOR I HAD COMMITTED DEEDS OF MISCHIEF BEYONDDESCRIPTION HORRIBLE AND MORE MUCH MORE I PERSUADED MYSELF WAS YETBEHIND. YET MY HEART OVERFLOWED WITH KINDNESS AND THE LOVE OF VIRTUE.I HAD BEGUN LIFE WITH BENEVOLENT INTENTIONS AND THIRSTED FOR THE MOMENTWHEN I SHOULD PUT THEM IN PRACTICE AND MAKE MYSELF USEFUL TO MY FELLOWBEINGS. NOW ALL WAS BLASTED INSTEAD OF THAT SERENITY OF CONSCIENCEWHICH ALLOWED ME TO LOOK BACK UPON THE PAST WITH SELFSATISFACTION ANDFROM THENCE TO GATHER PROMISE OF NEW HOPES I WAS SEIZED BY REMORSE ANDTHE SENSE OF GUILT WHICH HURRIED ME AWAY TO A HELL OF INTENSE TORTURESSUCH AS NO LANGUAGE CAN DESCRIBE.THIS STATE OF MIND PREYED UPON MY HEALTH WHICH HAD PERHAPS NEVERENTIRELY RECOVERED FROM THE FIRST SHOCK IT HAD SUSTAINED.

NOW I COULD ONLY ANSWER MY FATHER WITH A LOOK OFDESPAIR AND ENDEAVOUR TO HIDE MYSELF FROM HIS VIEW.ABOUT THIS TIME WE RETIRED TO OUR HOUSE AT BELRIVE. THIS CHANGE WASPARTICULARLY AGREEABLE TO ME. THE SHUTTING OF THE GATES REGULARLY ATTEN OCLOCK AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF REMAINING ON THE LAKE AFTER THATHOUR HAD RENDERED OUR RESIDENCE WITHIN THE WALLS OF GENEVA VERY IRKSOMETO ME. I WAS NOW FREE. OFTEN AFTER THE REST OF THE FAMILY HADRETIRED FOR THE NIGHT I TOOK THE BOAT AND PASSED MANY HOURS UPON THEWATER. SOMETIMES WITH MY SAILS SET I WAS CARRIED BY THE WIND ANDSOMETIMES AFTER ROWING INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE I LEFT THE BOAT TOPURSUE ITS OWN COURSE AND GAVE WAY TO MY OWN MISERABLE REFLECTIONS. IWAS OFTEN TEMPTED WHEN ALL WAS AT PEACE AROUND ME AND I THE ONLYUNQUIET THING THAT WANDERED RESTLESS IN A SCENE SO BEAUTIFUL ANDHEAVENLYIF I EXCEPT SOME BAT OR THE FROGS WHOSE HARSH ANDINTERRUPTED CROAKING WAS HEARD ONLY WHEN I APPROACHED THE SHOREOFTENI SAY I WAS TEMPTED TO PLUNGE INTO THE SILENT LAKE THAT THE WATERSMIGHT CLOSE OVER ME AND MY CALAMITIES FOR EVER. BUT I WAS RESTRAINEDWHEN I THOUGHT OF THE HEROIC AND SUFFERING ELIZABETH WHOM I TENDERLYLOVED AND WHOSE EXISTENCE WAS BOUND UP IN MINE. I THOUGHT ALSO OF MYFATHER AND SURVIVING BROTHER SHOULD I BY MY BASE DESERTION LEAVE THEMEXPOSED AND UNPROTECTED TO THE MALICE OF THE FIEND WHOM I HAD LET LOOSEAMONG THEMAT THESE MOMENTS I WEPT BITTERLY AND WISHED THAT PEACE WOULD REVISIT MYMIND ONLY THAT I MIGHT AFFORD THEM CONSOLATION AND HAPPINESS. BUT THATCOULD NOT BE. REMORSE EXTINGUISHED EVERY HOPE. I HAD BEEN THE AUTHOR OFUNALTERABLE EVILS AND I LIVED IN DAILY FEAR LEST THE MONSTER WHOM I HADCREATED SHOULD PERPETRATE SOME NEW WICKEDNESS. I HAD AN OBSCURE FEELINGTHAT ALL WAS NOT OVER AND THAT HE WOULD STILL COMMIT SOME SIGNAL CRIMEWHICH BY ITS ENORMITY SHOULD ALMOST EFFACE THE RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST.THERE WAS ALWAYS SCOPE FOR FEAR SO LONG AS ANYTHING I LOVED REMAINEDBEHIND. MY ABHORRENCE OF THIS FIEND CANNOT BE CONCEIVED. WHEN I THOUGHT OFHIM I GNASHED MY TEETH MY EYES BECAME INFLAMED AND I ARDENTLY WISHED TOEXTINGUISH THAT LIFE WHICH I HAD SO THOUGHTLESSLY BESTOWED. WHEN IREFLECTED ON HIS CRIMES AND MALICE MY HATRED AND REVENGE BURST ALL BOUNDSOF MODERATION. I WOULD HAVE MADE A PILGRIMAGE TO THE HIGHEST PEAK OF THEANDES COULD I WHEN THERE HAVE PRECIPITATED HIM TO THEIR BASE. I WISHEDTO SEE HIM AGAIN THAT I MIGHT WREAK THE UTMOST EXTENT OF ABHORRENCE ON HISHEAD AND AVENGE THE DEATHS OF WILLIAM AND JUSTINE.OUR HOUSE WAS THE HOUSE OF MOURNING. MY FATHERS HEALTH WAS DEEPLYSHAKEN BY THE HORROR OF THE RECENT EVENTS. ELIZABETH WAS SAD ANDDESPONDING SHE NO LONGER TOOK DELIGHT IN HER ORDINARY OCCUPATIONS ALLPLEASURE SEEMED TO HER SACRILEGE TOWARD THE DEAD ETERNAL WOE AND TEARS SHETHEN THOUGHT WAS THE JUST TRIBUTE SHE SHOULD PAY TO INNOCENCE SO BLASTEDAND DESTROYED. SHE WAS NO LONGER THAT HAPPY CREATURE WHO IN EARLIER YOUTHWANDERED WITH ME ON THE BANKS OF THE LAKE AND TALKED WITH ECSTASY OF OURFUTURE PROSPECTS. THE FIRST OF THOSE SORROWS WHICH ARE SENT TO WEAN US FROMTHE EARTH HAD VISITED HER AND ITS DIMMING INFLUENCE QUENCHED HER DEARESTSMILES.WHEN I REFLECT MY DEAR COUSIN SAID SHE ON THE MISERABLE DEATH OFJUSTINE MORITZ I NO LONGER SEE THE WORLD AND ITS WORKS AS THEY BEFOREAPPEARED TO ME. BEFORE I LOOKED UPON THE ACCOUNTS OF VICE ANDINJUSTICE THAT I READ IN BOOKS OR HEARD FROM OTHERS AS TALES OF ANCIENTDAYS OR IMAGINARY EVILS AT LEAST THEY WERE REMOTE AND MORE FAMILIAR TOREASON THAN TO THE IMAGINATION BUT NOW MISERY HAS COME HOME AND MENAPPEAR TO ME AS MONSTERS THIRSTING FOR EACH OTHERS BLOOD. YET I AMCERTAINLY UNJUST. EVERYBODY BELIEVED THAT POOR GIRL TO BE GUILTY ANDIF SHE COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME FOR WHICH SHE SUFFERED ASSUREDLYSHE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MOST DEPRAVED OF HUMAN CREATURES. FOR THE SAKEOF A FEW JEWELS TO HAVE MURDERED THE SON OF HER BENEFACTOR AND FRIENDA CHILD WHOM SHE HAD NURSED FROM ITS BIRTH AND APPEARED TO LOVE AS IFIT HAD BEEN HER OWN I COULD NOT CONSENT TO THE DEATH OF ANY HUMANBEING BUT CERTAINLY I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT SUCH A CREATURE UNFIT TOREMAIN IN THE SOCIETY OF MEN. BUT SHE WAS INNOCENT. I KNOW I FEELSHE WAS INNOCENT YOU ARE OF THE SAME OPINION AND THAT CONFIRMS ME.ALAS VICTOR WHEN FALSEHOOD CAN LOOK SO LIKE THE TRUTH WHO CANASSURE THEMSELVES OF CERTAIN HAPPINESS I FEEL AS IF I WERE WALKING ONTHE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE TOWARDS WHICH THOUSANDS ARE CROWDING ANDENDEAVOURING TO PLUNGE ME INTO THE ABYSS. WILLIAM AND JUSTINE WEREASSASSINATED AND THE MURDERER ESCAPES HE WALKS ABOUT THE WORLD FREEAND PERHAPS RESPECTED. BUT EVEN IF I WERE CONDEMNED TO SUFFER ON THESCAFFOLD FOR THE SAME CRIMES I WOULD NOT CHANGE PLACES WITH SUCH AWRETCH.I LISTENED TO THIS DISCOURSE WITH THE EXTREMEST AGONY. I NOT IN DEEDBUT IN EFFECT WAS THE TRUE MURDERER. ELIZABETH READ MY ANGUISH IN MYCOUNTENANCE AND KINDLY TAKING MY HAND SAID MY DEAREST FRIEND YOUMUST CALM YOURSELF. THESE EVENTS HAVE AFFECTED ME GOD KNOWS HOWDEEPLY BUT I AM NOT SO WRETCHED AS YOU ARE. THERE IS AN EXPRESSION OFDESPAIR AND SOMETIMES OF REVENGE IN YOUR COUNTENANCE THAT MAKES METREMBLE. DEAR VICTOR BANISH THESE DARK PASSIONS. REMEMBER THEFRIENDS AROUND YOU WHO CENTRE ALL THEIR HOPES IN YOU. HAVE WE LOSTTHE POWER OF RENDERING YOU HAPPY AH WHILE WE LOVE WHILE WE ARETRUE TO EACH OTHER HERE IN THIS LAND OF PEACE AND BEAUTY YOUR NATIVECOUNTRY WE MAY REAP EVERY TRANQUIL BLESSINGWHAT CAN DISTURB OURPEACEAND COULD NOT SUCH WORDS FROM HER WHOM I FONDLY PRIZED BEFORE EVERYOTHER GIFT OF FORTUNE SUFFICE TO CHASE AWAY THE FIEND THAT LURKED IN MYHEART EVEN AS SHE SPOKE I DREW NEAR TO HER AS IF IN TERROR LEST ATTHAT VERY MOMENT THE DESTROYER HAD BEEN NEAR TO ROB ME OF HER.THUS NOT THE TENDERNESS OF FRIENDSHIP NOR THE BEAUTY OF EARTH NOR OFHEAVEN COULD REDEEM MY SOUL FROM WOE THE VERY ACCENTS OF LOVE WEREINEFFECTUAL. I WAS ENCOMPASSED BY A CLOUD WHICH NO BENEFICIALINFLUENCE COULD PENETRATE. THE WOUNDED DEER DRAGGING ITS FAINTINGLIMBS TO SOME UNTRODDEN BRAKE THERE TO GAZE UPON THE ARROW WHICH HADPIERCED IT AND TO DIE WAS BUT A TYPE OF ME.SOMETIMES I COULD COPE WITH THE SULLEN DESPAIR THAT OVERWHELMED ME BUTSOMETIMES THE WHIRLWIND PASSIONS OF MY SOUL DROVE ME TO SEEK BY BODILYEXERCISE AND BY CHANGE OF PLACE SOME RELIEF FROM MY INTOLERABLESENSATIONS. IT WAS DURING AN ACCESS OF THIS KIND THAT I SUDDENLY LEFTMY HOME AND BENDING MY STEPS TOWARDS THE NEAR ALPINE VALLEYS SOUGHTIN THE MAGNIFICENCE THE ETERNITY OF SUCH SCENES TO FORGET MYSELF ANDMY EPHEMERAL BECAUSE HUMAN SORROWS. MY WANDERINGS WERE DIRECTEDTOWARDS THE VALLEY OF CHAMOUNIX. I HAD VISITED IT FREQUENTLY DURING MYBOYHOOD. SIX YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE THEN I WAS A WRECK BUT NOUGHTHAD CHANGED IN THOSE SAVAGE AND ENDURING SCENES.I PERFORMED THE FIRST PART OF MY JOURNEY ON HORSEBACK. I AFTERWARDSHIRED A MULE AS THE MORE SUREFOOTED AND LEAST LIABLE TO RECEIVEINJURY ON THESE RUGGED ROADS. THE WEATHER WAS FINE IT WAS ABOUT THEMIDDLE OF THE MONTH OF AUGUST NEARLY TWO MONTHS AFTER THE DEATH OFJUSTINE THAT MISERABLE EPOCH FROM WHICH I DATED ALL MY WOE. THEWEIGHT UPON MY SPIRIT WAS SENSIBLY LIGHTENED AS I PLUNGED YET DEEPER INTHE RAVINE OF ARVE. THE IMMENSE MOUNTAINS AND PRECIPICES THAT OVERHUNGME ON EVERY SIDE THE SOUND OF THE RIVER RAGING AMONG THE ROCKS ANDTHE DASHING OF THE WATERFALLS AROUND SPOKE OF A POWER MIGHTY ASOMNIPOTENCEAND I CEASED TO FEAR OR TO BEND BEFORE ANY BEING LESSALMIGHTY THAN THAT WHICH HAD CREATED AND RULED THE ELEMENTS HEREDISPLAYED IN THEIR MOST TERRIFIC GUISE. STILL AS I ASCENDED HIGHERTHE VALLEY ASSUMED A MORE MAGNIFICENT AND ASTONISHING CHARACTER.RUINED CASTLES HANGING ON THE PRECIPICES OF PINY MOUNTAINS THEIMPETUOUS ARVE AND COTTAGES EVERY HERE AND THERE PEEPING FORTH FROMAMONG THE TREES FORMED A SCENE OF SINGULAR BEAUTY. BUT IT WASAUGMENTED AND RENDERED SUBLIME BY THE MIGHTY ALPS WHOSE WHITE ANDSHINING PYRAMIDS AND DOMES TOWERED ABOVE ALL AS BELONGING TO ANOTHEREARTH THE HABITATIONS OF ANOTHER RACE OF BEINGS.I PASSED THE BRIDGE OF PLISSIER WHERE THE RAVINE WHICH THE RIVERFORMS OPENED BEFORE ME AND I BEGAN TO ASCEND THE MOUNTAIN THATOVERHANGS IT. SOON AFTER I ENTERED THE VALLEY OF CHAMOUNIX. THISVALLEY IS MORE WONDERFUL AND SUBLIME BUT NOT SO BEAUTIFUL ANDPICTURESQUE AS THAT OF SERVOX THROUGH WHICH I HAD JUST PASSED. THEHIGH AND SNOWY MOUNTAINS WERE ITS IMMEDIATE BOUNDARIES BUT I SAW NOMORE RUINED CASTLES AND FERTILE FIELDS. IMMENSE GLACIERS APPROACHEDTHE ROAD I HEARD THE RUMBLING THUNDER OF THE FALLING AVALANCHE ANDMARKED THE SMOKE OF ITS PASSAGE. MONT BLANC THE SUPREME ANDMAGNIFICENT MONT BLANC RAISED ITSELF FROM THE SURROUNDING AIGUILLESAND ITS TREMENDOUS DME OVERLOOKED THE VALLEY.A TINGLING LONGLOST SENSE OF PLEASURE OFTEN CAME ACROSS ME DURING THISJOURNEY. SOME TURN IN THE ROAD SOME NEW OBJECT SUDDENLY PERCEIVED ANDRECOGNISED REMINDED ME OF DAYS GONE BY AND WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THELIGHTHEARTED GAIETY OF BOYHOOD. THE VERY WINDS WHISPERED IN SOOTHINGACCENTS AND MATERNAL NATURE BADE ME WEEP NO MORE. THEN AGAIN THEKINDLY INFLUENCE CEASED TO ACTI FOUND MYSELF FETTERED AGAIN TO GRIEFAND INDULGING IN ALL THE MISERY OF REFLECTION. THEN I SPURRED ON MYANIMAL STRIVING SO TO FORGET THE WORLD MY FEARS AND MORE THAN ALLMYSELFOR IN A MORE DESPERATE FASHION I ALIGHTED AND THREW MYSELF ONTHE GRASS WEIGHED DOWN BY HORROR AND DESPAIR.AT LENGTH I ARRIVED AT THE VILLAGE OF CHAMOUNIX. EXHAUSTION SUCCEEDEDTO THE EXTREME FATIGUE BOTH OF BODY AND OF MIND WHICH I HAD ENDURED.FOR A SHORT SPACE OF TIME I REMAINED AT THE WINDOW WATCHING THE PALLIDLIGHTNINGS THAT PLAYED ABOVE MONT BLANC AND LISTENING TO THE RUSHING OFTHE ARVE WHICH PURSUED ITS NOISY WAY BENEATH. THE SAME LULLING SOUNDSACTED AS A LULLABY TO MY TOO KEEN SENSATIONS WHEN I PLACED MY HEADUPON MY PILLOW SLEEP CREPT OVER ME I FELT IT AS IT CAME AND BLESSEDTHE GIVER OF OBLIVION.CHAPTER I SPENT THE FOLLOWING DAY ROAMING THROUGH THE VALLEY. I STOOD BESIDETHE SOURCES OF THE ARVEIRON WHICH TAKE THEIR RISE IN A GLACIER THATWITH SLOW PACE IS ADVANCING DOWN FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE HILLS TOBARRICADE THE VALLEY. THE ABRUPT SIDES OF VAST MOUNTAINS WERE BEFOREME THE ICY WALL OF THE GLACIER OVERHUNG ME A FEW SHATTERED PINES WERESCATTERED AROUND AND THE SOLEMN SILENCE OF THIS GLORIOUSPRESENCECHAMBER OF IMPERIAL NATURE WAS BROKEN ONLY BY THE BRAWLINGWAVES OR THE FALL OF SOME VAST FRAGMENT THE THUNDER SOUND OF THEAVALANCHE OR THE CRACKING REVERBERATED ALONG THE MOUNTAINS OF THEACCUMULATED ICE WHICH THROUGH THE SILENT WORKING OF IMMUTABLE LAWSWAS EVER AND ANON RENT AND TORN AS IF IT HAD BEEN BUT A PLAYTHING INTHEIR HANDS. THESE SUBLIME AND MAGNIFICENT SCENES AFFORDED ME THEGREATEST CONSOLATION THAT I WAS CAPABLE OF RECEIVING. THEY ELEVATED MEFROM ALL LITTLENESS OF FEELING AND ALTHOUGH THEY DID NOT REMOVE MYGRIEF THEY SUBDUED AND TRANQUILLISED IT. IN SOME DEGREE ALSO THEYDIVERTED MY MIND FROM THE THOUGHTS OVER WHICH IT HAD BROODED FOR THELAST MONTH. I RETIRED TO REST AT NIGHT MY SLUMBERS AS IT WEREWAITED ON AND MINISTERED TO BY THE ASSEMBLANCE OF GRAND SHAPES WHICH IHAD CONTEMPLATED DURING THE DAY. THEY CONGREGATED ROUND ME THEUNSTAINED SNOWY MOUNTAINTOP THE GLITTERING PINNACLE THE PINE WOODSAND RAGGED BARE RAVINE THE EAGLE SOARING AMIDST THE CLOUDSTHEY ALLGATHERED ROUND ME AND BADE ME BE AT PEACE.WHERE HAD THEY FLED WHEN THE NEXT MORNING I AWOKE ALL OFSOULINSPIRITING FLED WITH SLEEP AND DARK MELANCHOLY CLOUDED EVERYTHOUGHT. THE RAIN WAS POURING IN TORRENTS AND THICK MISTS HID THESUMMITS OF THE MOUNTAINS SO THAT I EVEN SAW NOT THE FACES OF THOSEMIGHTY FRIENDS. STILL I WOULD PENETRATE THEIR MISTY VEIL AND SEEK THEMIN THEIR CLOUDY RETREATS. WHAT WERE RAIN AND STORM TO ME MY MULE WASBROUGHT TO THE DOOR AND I RESOLVED TO ASCEND TO THE SUMMIT OFMONTANVERT. I REMEMBERED THE EFFECT THAT THE VIEW OF THE TREMENDOUSAND EVERMOVING GLACIER HAD PRODUCED UPON MY MIND WHEN I FIRST SAW IT.IT HAD THEN FILLED ME WITH A SUBLIME ECSTASY THAT GAVE WINGS TO THESOUL AND ALLOWED IT TO SOAR FROM THE OBSCURE WORLD TO LIGHT AND JOY.THE SIGHT OF THE AWFUL AND MAJESTIC IN NATURE HAD INDEED ALWAYS THEEFFECT OF SOLEMNISING MY MIND AND CAUSING ME TO FORGET THE PASSINGCARES OF LIFE. I DETERMINED TO GO WITHOUT A GUIDE FOR I WAS WELLACQUAINTED WITH THE PATH AND THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER WOULD DESTROY THESOLITARY GRANDEUR OF THE SCENE.THE ASCENT IS PRECIPITOUS BUT THE PATH IS CUT INTO CONTINUAL AND SHORTWINDINGS WHICH ENABLE YOU TO SURMOUNT THE PERPENDICULARITY OF THEMOUNTAIN. IT IS A SCENE TERRIFICALLY DESOLATE. IN A THOUSAND SPOTSTHE TRACES OF THE WINTER AVALANCHE MAY BE PERCEIVED WHERE TREES LIEBROKEN AND STREWED ON THE GROUND SOME ENTIRELY DESTROYED OTHERS BENTLEANING UPON THE JUTTING ROCKS OF THE MOUNTAIN OR TRANSVERSELY UPONOTHER TREES. THE PATH AS YOU ASCEND HIGHER IS INTERSECTED BY RAVINESOF SNOW DOWN WHICH STONES CONTINUALLY ROLL FROM ABOVE ONE OF THEM ISPARTICULARLY DANGEROUS AS THE SLIGHTEST SOUND SUCH AS EVEN SPEAKINGIN A LOUD VOICE PRODUCES A CONCUSSION OF AIR SUFFICIENT TO DRAWDESTRUCTION UPON THE HEAD OF THE SPEAKER. THE PINES ARE NOT TALL ORLUXURIANT BUT THEY ARE SOMBRE AND ADD AN AIR OF SEVERITY TO THE SCENE.I LOOKED ON THE VALLEY BENEATH VAST MISTS WERE RISING FROM THE RIVERSWHICH RAN THROUGH IT AND CURLING IN THICK WREATHS AROUND THE OPPOSITEMOUNTAINS WHOSE SUMMITS WERE HID IN THE UNIFORM CLOUDS WHILE RAINPOURED FROM THE DARK SKY AND ADDED TO THE MELANCHOLY IMPRESSION IRECEIVED FROM THE OBJECTS AROUND ME. ALAS WHY DOES MAN BOAST OFSENSIBILITIES SUPERIOR TO THOSE APPARENT IN THE BRUTE IT ONLY RENDERSTHEM MORE NECESSARY BEINGS. IF OUR IMPULSES WERE CONFINED TO HUNGERTHIRST AND DESIRE WE MIGHT BE NEARLY FREE BUT NOW WE ARE MOVED BYEVERY WIND THAT BLOWS AND A CHANCE WORD OR SCENE THAT THAT WORD MAYCONVEY TO US.  WE REST A DREAM HAS POWER TO POISON SLEEP.     WE RISE ONE WANDRING THOUGHT POLLUTES THE DAY.  WE FEEL CONCEIVE OR REASON LAUGH OR WEEP     EMBRACE FOND WOE OR CAST OUR CARES AWAY  IT IS THE SAME FOR BE IT JOY OR SORROW     THE PATH OF ITS DEPARTURE STILL IS FREE.  MANS YESTERDAY MAY NEER BE LIKE HIS MORROW     NOUGHT MAY ENDURE BUT MUTABILITYIT WAS NEARLY NOON WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE TOP OF THE ASCENT. FOR SOMETIME I SAT UPON THE ROCK THAT OVERLOOKS THE SEA OF ICE. A MIST COVEREDBOTH THAT AND THE SURROUNDING MOUNTAINS. PRESENTLY A BREEZE DISSIPATEDTHE CLOUD AND I DESCENDED UPON THE GLACIER. THE SURFACE IS VERYUNEVEN RISING LIKE THE WAVES OF A TROUBLED SEA DESCENDING LOW ANDINTERSPERSED BY RIFTS THAT SINK DEEP. THE FIELD OF ICE IS ALMOST ALEAGUE IN WIDTH BUT I SPENT NEARLY TWO HOURS IN CROSSING IT. THEOPPOSITE MOUNTAIN IS A BARE PERPENDICULAR ROCK. FROM THE SIDE WHERE INOW STOOD MONTANVERT WAS EXACTLY OPPOSITE AT THE DISTANCE OF A LEAGUEAND ABOVE IT ROSE MONT BLANC IN AWFUL MAJESTY. I REMAINED IN A RECESSOF THE ROCK GAZING ON THIS WONDERFUL AND STUPENDOUS SCENE. THE SEAOR RATHER THE VAST RIVER OF ICE WOUND AMONG ITS DEPENDENT MOUNTAINSWHOSE AERIAL SUMMITS HUNG OVER ITS RECESSES. THEIR ICY AND GLITTERINGPEAKS SHONE IN THE SUNLIGHT OVER THE CLOUDS. MY HEART WHICH WASBEFORE SORROWFUL NOW SWELLED WITH SOMETHING LIKE JOY I EXCLAIMEDWANDERING SPIRITS IF INDEED YE WANDER AND DO NOT REST IN YOUR NARROWBEDS ALLOW ME THIS FAINT HAPPINESS OR TAKE ME AS YOUR COMPANIONAWAY FROM THE JOYS OF LIFE.AS I SAID THIS I SUDDENLY BEHELD THE FIGURE OF A MAN AT SOME DISTANCEADVANCING TOWARDS ME WITH SUPERHUMAN SPEED. HE BOUNDED OVER THECREVICES IN THE ICE AMONG WHICH I HAD WALKED WITH CAUTION HISSTATURE ALSO AS HE APPROACHED SEEMED TO EXCEED THAT OF MAN. I WASTROUBLED A MIST CAME OVER MY EYES AND I FELT A FAINTNESS SEIZE MEBUT I WAS QUICKLY RESTORED BY THE COLD GALE OF THE MOUNTAINS. IPERCEIVED AS THE SHAPE CAME NEARER SIGHT TREMENDOUS AND ABHORREDTHAT IT WAS THE WRETCH WHOM I HAD CREATED. I TREMBLED WITH RAGE ANDHORROR RESOLVING TO WAIT HIS APPROACH AND THEN CLOSE WITH HIM INMORTAL COMBAT. HE APPROACHED HIS COUNTENANCE BESPOKE BITTER ANGUISHCOMBINED WITH DISDAIN AND MALIGNITY WHILE ITS UNEARTHLY UGLINESSRENDERED IT ALMOST TOO HORRIBLE FOR HUMAN EYES. BUT I SCARCELYOBSERVED THIS RAGE AND HATRED HAD AT FIRST DEPRIVED ME OF UTTERANCEAND I RECOVERED ONLY TO OVERWHELM HIM WITH WORDS EXPRESSIVE OF FURIOUSDETESTATION AND CONTEMPT.DEVIL I EXCLAIMED DO YOU DARE APPROACH ME AND DONOT YOU FEAR THE FIERCE VENGEANCE OF MY ARM WREAKED ON YOUR MISERABLE HEADBEGONE VILE INSECT OR RATHER STAY THAT I MAY TRAMPLE YOU TO DUST ANDOH THAT I COULD WITH THE EXTINCTION OF YOUR MISERABLE EXISTENCE RESTORETHOSE VICTIMS WHOM YOU HAVE SO DIABOLICALLY MURDEREDI EXPECTED THIS RECEPTION SAID THE DMON. ALL MEN HATE THEWRETCHED HOW THEN MUST I BE HATED WHO AM MISERABLE BEYOND ALLLIVING THINGS YET YOU MY CREATOR DETEST AND SPURN ME THY CREATURETO WHOM THOU ART BOUND BY TIES ONLY DISSOLUBLE BY THE ANNIHILATION OFONE OF US. YOU PURPOSE TO KILL ME. HOW DARE YOU SPORT THUS WITH LIFEDO YOUR DUTY TOWARDS ME AND I WILL DO MINE TOWARDS YOU AND THE REST OFMANKIND. IF YOU WILL COMPLY WITH MY CONDITIONS I WILL LEAVE THEM ANDYOU AT PEACE BUT IF YOU REFUSE I WILL GLUT THE MAW OF DEATH UNTIL ITBE SATIATED WITH THE BLOOD OF YOUR REMAINING FRIENDS.ABHORRED MONSTER FIEND THAT THOU ART THE TORTURES OF HELL ARE TOOMILD A VENGEANCE FOR THY CRIMES. WRETCHED DEVIL YOU REPROACH ME WITHYOUR CREATION COME ON THEN THAT I MAY EXTINGUISH THE SPARK WHICH ISO NEGLIGENTLY BESTOWED.MY RAGE WAS WITHOUT BOUNDS I SPRANG ON HIM IMPELLED BY ALL THEFEELINGS WHICH CAN ARM ONE BEING AGAINST THE EXISTENCE OF ANOTHER.HE EASILY ELUDED ME AND SAIDBE CALM I ENTREAT YOU TO HEAR ME BEFORE YOU GIVE VENT TO YOUR HATREDON MY DEVOTED HEAD. HAVE I NOT SUFFERED ENOUGH THAT YOU SEEK TOINCREASE MY MISERY LIFE ALTHOUGH IT MAY ONLY BE AN ACCUMULATION OFANGUISH IS DEAR TO ME AND I WILL DEFEND IT. REMEMBER THOU HAST MADEME MORE POWERFUL THAN THYSELF MY HEIGHT IS SUPERIOR TO THINE MYJOINTS MORE SUPPLE. BUT I WILL NOT BE TEMPTED TO SET MYSELF INOPPOSITION TO THEE. I AM THY CREATURE AND I WILL BE EVEN MILD ANDDOCILE TO MY NATURAL LORD AND KING IF THOU WILT ALSO PERFORM THY PARTTHE WHICH THOU OWEST ME. OH FRANKENSTEIN BE NOT EQUITABLE TO EVERYOTHER AND TRAMPLE UPON ME ALONE TO WHOM THY JUSTICE AND EVEN THYCLEMENCY AND AFFECTION IS MOST DUE. REMEMBER THAT I AM THY CREATUREI OUGHT TO BE THY ADAM BUT I AM RATHER THE FALLEN ANGEL WHOM THOUDRIVEST FROM JOY FOR NO MISDEED. EVERYWHERE I SEE BLISS FROM WHICH IALONE AM IRREVOCABLY EXCLUDED. I WAS BENEVOLENT AND GOOD MISERY MADEME A FIEND. MAKE ME HAPPY AND I SHALL AGAIN BE VIRTUOUS.BEGONE I WILL NOT HEAR YOU. THERE CAN BE NO COMMUNITY BETWEEN YOUAND ME WE ARE ENEMIES. BEGONE OR LET US TRY OUR STRENGTH IN A FIGHTIN WHICH ONE MUST FALL.HOW CAN I MOVE THEE WILL NO ENTREATIES CAUSE THEE TO TURN AFAVOURABLE EYE UPON THY CREATURE WHO IMPLORES THY GOODNESS ANDCOMPASSION BELIEVE ME FRANKENSTEIN I WAS BENEVOLENT MY SOUL GLOWEDWITH LOVE AND HUMANITY BUT AM I NOT ALONE MISERABLY ALONE YOU MYCREATOR ABHOR ME WHAT HOPE CAN I GATHER FROM YOUR FELLOW CREATURESWHO OWE ME NOTHING THEY SPURN AND HATE ME. THE DESERT MOUNTAINS ANDDREARY GLACIERS ARE MY REFUGE. I HAVE WANDERED HERE MANY DAYS THECAVES OF ICE WHICH I ONLY DO NOT FEAR ARE A DWELLING TO ME AND THEONLY ONE WHICH MAN DOES NOT GRUDGE. THESE BLEAK SKIES I HAIL FOR THEYARE KINDER TO ME THAN YOUR FELLOW BEINGS. IF THE MULTITUDE OF MANKINDKNEW OF MY EXISTENCE THEY WOULD DO AS YOU DO AND ARM THEMSELVES FORMY DESTRUCTION. SHALL I NOT THEN HATE THEM WHO ABHOR ME I WILL KEEPNO TERMS WITH MY ENEMIES. I AM MISERABLE AND THEY SHALL SHARE MYWRETCHEDNESS. YET IT IS IN YOUR POWER TO RECOMPENSE ME AND DELIVERTHEM FROM AN EVIL WHICH IT ONLY REMAINS FOR YOU TO MAKE SO GREAT THATNOT ONLY YOU AND YOUR FAMILY BUT THOUSANDS OF OTHERS SHALL BESWALLOWED UP IN THE WHIRLWINDS OF ITS RAGE. LET YOUR COMPASSION BEMOVED AND DO NOT DISDAIN ME. LISTEN TO MY TALE WHEN YOU HAVE HEARDTHAT ABANDON OR COMMISERATE ME AS YOU SHALL JUDGE THAT I DESERVE.BUT HEAR ME. THE GUILTY ARE ALLOWED BY HUMAN LAWS BLOODY AS THEYARE TO SPEAK IN THEIR OWN DEFENCE BEFORE THEY ARE CONDEMNED. LISTENTO ME FRANKENSTEIN. YOU ACCUSE ME OF MURDER AND YET YOU WOULD WITHA SATISFIED CONSCIENCE DESTROY YOUR OWN CREATURE. OH PRAISE THEETERNAL JUSTICE OF MAN YET I ASK YOU NOT TO SPARE ME LISTEN TO MEAND THEN IF YOU CAN AND IF YOU WILL DESTROY THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS.WHY DO YOU CALL TO MY REMEMBRANCE I REJOINED CIRCUMSTANCES OFWHICH I SHUDDER TO REFLECT THAT I HAVE BEEN THE MISERABLE ORIGIN ANDAUTHOR CURSED BE THE DAY ABHORRED DEVIL IN WHICH YOU FIRST SAWLIGHT CURSED ALTHOUGH I CURSE MYSELF BE THE HANDS THAT FORMED YOUYOU HAVE MADE ME WRETCHED BEYOND EXPRESSION. YOU HAVE LEFT ME NO POWERTO CONSIDER WHETHER I AM JUST TO YOU OR NOT. BEGONE RELIEVE ME FROMTHE SIGHT OF YOUR DETESTED FORM.THUS I RELIEVE THEE MY CREATOR HE SAID AND PLACED HIS HATED HANDSBEFORE MY EYES WHICH I FLUNG FROM ME WITH VIOLENCE THUS I TAKE FROMTHEE A SIGHT WHICH YOU ABHOR. STILL THOU CANST LISTEN TO ME AND GRANTME THY COMPASSION. BY THE VIRTUES THAT I ONCE POSSESSED I DEMAND THISFROM YOU. HEAR MY TALE IT IS LONG AND STRANGE AND THE TEMPERATURE OFTHIS PLACE IS NOT FITTING TO YOUR FINE SENSATIONS COME TO THE HUT UPONTHE MOUNTAIN. THE SUN IS YET HIGH IN THE HEAVENS BEFORE IT DESCENDSTO HIDE ITSELF BEHIND YOUR SNOWY PRECIPICES AND ILLUMINATE ANOTHERWORLD YOU WILL HAVE HEARD MY STORY AND CAN DECIDE. ON YOU IT RESTSWHETHER I QUIT FOR EVER THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AND LEAD A HARMLESSLIFE OR BECOME THE SCOURGE OF YOUR FELLOW CREATURES AND THE AUTHOR OFYOUR OWN SPEEDY RUIN.AS HE SAID THIS HE LED THE WAY ACROSS THE ICE I FOLLOWED. MY HEARTWAS FULL AND I DID NOT ANSWER HIM BUT AS I PROCEEDED I WEIGHED THEVARIOUS ARGUMENTS THAT HE HAD USED AND DETERMINED AT LEAST TO LISTEN TOHIS TALE. I WAS PARTLY URGED BY CURIOSITY AND COMPASSION CONFIRMED MYRESOLUTION. I HAD HITHERTO SUPPOSED HIM TO BE THE MURDERER OF MYBROTHER AND I EAGERLY SOUGHT A CONFIRMATION OR DENIAL OF THIS OPINION.FOR THE FIRST TIME ALSO I FELT WHAT THE DUTIES OF A CREATOR TOWARDSHIS CREATURE WERE AND THAT I OUGHT TO RENDER HIM HAPPY BEFORE ICOMPLAINED OF HIS WICKEDNESS. THESE MOTIVES URGED ME TO COMPLY WITHHIS DEMAND. WE CROSSED THE ICE THEREFORE AND ASCENDED THE OPPOSITEROCK. THE AIR WAS COLD AND THE RAIN AGAIN BEGAN TO DESCEND WEENTERED THE HUT THE FIEND WITH AN AIR OF EXULTATION I WITH A HEAVYHEART AND DEPRESSED SPIRITS. BUT I CONSENTED TO LISTEN AND SEATINGMYSELF BY THE FIRE WHICH MY ODIOUS COMPANION HAD LIGHTED HE THUS BEGANHIS TALE.CHAPTER IT IS WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY THAT I REMEMBER THE ORIGINAL ERA OFMY BEING ALL THE EVENTS OF THAT PERIOD APPEAR CONFUSED AND INDISTINCT.A STRANGE MULTIPLICITY OF SENSATIONS SEIZED ME AND I SAW FELT HEARDAND SMELT AT THE SAME TIME AND IT WAS INDEED A LONG TIME BEFORE ILEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE OPERATIONS OF MY VARIOUS SENSES. BYDEGREES I REMEMBER A STRONGER LIGHT PRESSED UPON MY NERVES SO THAT IWAS OBLIGED TO SHUT MY EYES. DARKNESS THEN CAME OVER ME AND TROUBLEDME BUT HARDLY HAD I FELT THIS WHEN BY OPENING MY EYES AS I NOWSUPPOSE THE LIGHT POURED IN UPON ME AGAIN. I WALKED AND I BELIEVEDESCENDED BUT I PRESENTLY FOUND A GREAT ALTERATION IN MY SENSATIONS.BEFORE DARK AND OPAQUE BODIES HAD SURROUNDED ME IMPERVIOUS TO MYTOUCH OR SIGHT BUT I NOW FOUND THAT I COULD WANDER ON AT LIBERTY WITHNO OBSTACLES WHICH I COULD NOT EITHER SURMOUNT OR AVOID. THE LIGHTBECAME MORE AND MORE OPPRESSIVE TO ME AND THE HEAT WEARYING ME AS IWALKED I SOUGHT A PLACE WHERE I COULD RECEIVE SHADE. THIS WAS THEFOREST NEAR INGOLSTADT AND HERE I LAY BY THE SIDE OF A BROOK RESTINGFROM MY FATIGUE UNTIL I FELT TORMENTED BY HUNGER AND THIRST. THISROUSED ME FROM MY NEARLY DORMANT STATE AND I ATE SOME BERRIES WHICH IFOUND HANGING ON THE TREES OR LYING ON THE GROUND. I SLAKED MY THIRSTAT THE BROOK AND THEN LYING DOWN WAS OVERCOME BY SLEEP.IT WAS DARK WHEN I AWOKE I FELT COLD ALSO AND HALF FRIGHTENED AS ITWERE INSTINCTIVELY FINDING MYSELF SO DESOLATE. BEFORE I HAD QUITTEDYOUR APARTMENT ON A SENSATION OF COLD I HAD COVERED MYSELF WITH SOMECLOTHES BUT THESE WERE INSUFFICIENT TO SECURE ME FROM THE DEWS OFNIGHT. I WAS A POOR HELPLESS MISERABLE WRETCH I KNEW AND COULDDISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT FEELING PAIN INVADE ME ON ALL SIDES I SATDOWN AND WEPT.SOON A GENTLE LIGHT STOLE OVER THE HEAVENS AND GAVE ME A SENSATION OFPLEASURE. I STARTED UP AND BEHELD A RADIANT FORM RISE FROM AMONG THETREES. THE MOON I GAZED WITH A KIND OF WONDER. IT MOVED SLOWLYBUT IT ENLIGHTENED MY PATH AND I AGAIN WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF BERRIES.I WAS STILL COLD WHEN UNDER ONE OF THE TREES I FOUND A HUGE CLOAK WITHWHICH I COVERED MYSELF AND SAT DOWN UPON THE GROUND. NO DISTINCTIDEAS OCCUPIED MY MIND ALL WAS CONFUSED. I FELT LIGHT AND HUNGERAND THIRST AND DARKNESS INNUMERABLE SOUNDS RANG IN MY EARS AND ONALL SIDES VARIOUS SCENTS SALUTED ME THE ONLY OBJECT THAT I COULDDISTINGUISH WAS THE BRIGHT MOON AND I FIXED MY EYES ON THAT WITHPLEASURE.SEVERAL CHANGES OF DAY AND NIGHT PASSED AND THE ORB OF NIGHT HADGREATLY LESSENED WHEN I BEGAN TO DISTINGUISH MY SENSATIONS FROM EACHOTHER. I GRADUALLY SAW PLAINLY THE CLEAR STREAM THAT SUPPLIED ME WITHDRINK AND THE TREES THAT SHADED ME WITH THEIR FOLIAGE. I WAS DELIGHTEDWHEN I FIRST DISCOVERED THAT A PLEASANT SOUND WHICH OFTEN SALUTED MYEARS PROCEEDED FROM THE THROATS OF THE LITTLE WINGED ANIMALS WHO HADOFTEN INTERCEPTED THE LIGHT FROM MY EYES. I BEGAN ALSO TO OBSERVEWITH GREATER ACCURACY THE FORMS THAT SURROUNDED ME AND TO PERCEIVE THEBOUNDARIES OF THE RADIANT ROOF OF LIGHT WHICH CANOPIED ME. SOMETIMES ITRIED TO IMITATE THE PLEASANT SONGS OF THE BIRDS BUT WAS UNABLE.SOMETIMES I WISHED TO EXPRESS MY SENSATIONS IN MY OWN MODE BUT THEUNCOUTH AND INARTICULATE SOUNDS WHICH BROKE FROM ME FRIGHTENED ME INTOSILENCE AGAIN.THE MOON HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE NIGHT AND AGAIN WITH A LESSENEDFORM SHOWED ITSELF WHILE I STILL REMAINED IN THE FOREST. MYSENSATIONS HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME DISTINCT AND MY MIND RECEIVED EVERYDAY ADDITIONAL IDEAS. MY EYES BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE LIGHT AND TOPERCEIVE OBJECTS IN THEIR RIGHT FORMS I DISTINGUISHED THE INSECT FROMTHE HERB AND BY DEGREES ONE HERB FROM ANOTHER. I FOUND THAT THESPARROW UTTERED NONE BUT HARSH NOTES WHILST THOSE OF THE BLACKBIRD ANDTHRUSH WERE SWEET AND ENTICING.ONE DAY WHEN I WAS OPPRESSED BY COLD I FOUND A FIRE WHICH HAD BEENLEFT BY SOME WANDERING BEGGARS AND WAS OVERCOME WITH DELIGHT AT THEWARMTH I EXPERIENCED FROM IT. IN MY JOY I THRUST MY HAND INTO THE LIVEEMBERS BUT QUICKLY DREW IT OUT AGAIN WITH A CRY OF PAIN. HOW STRANGEI THOUGHT THAT THE SAME CAUSE SHOULD PRODUCE SUCH OPPOSITE EFFECTS IEXAMINED THE MATERIALS OF THE FIRE AND TO MY JOY FOUND IT TO BECOMPOSED OF WOOD. I QUICKLY COLLECTED SOME BRANCHES BUT THEY WERE WETAND WOULD NOT BURN. I WAS PAINED AT THIS AND SAT STILL WATCHING THEOPERATION OF THE FIRE. THE WET WOOD WHICH I HAD PLACED NEAR THE HEATDRIED AND ITSELF BECAME INFLAMED. I REFLECTED ON THIS AND BY TOUCHINGTHE VARIOUS BRANCHES I DISCOVERED THE CAUSE AND BUSIED MYSELF INCOLLECTING A GREAT QUANTITY OF WOOD THAT I MIGHT DRY IT AND HAVE APLENTIFUL SUPPLY OF FIRE. WHEN NIGHT CAME ON AND BROUGHT SLEEP WITHIT I WAS IN THE GREATEST FEAR LEST MY FIRE SHOULD BE EXTINGUISHED. ICOVERED IT CAREFULLY WITH DRY WOOD AND LEAVES AND PLACED WET BRANCHESUPON IT AND THEN SPREADING MY CLOAK I LAY ON THE GROUND AND SANKINTO SLEEP.IT WAS MORNING WHEN I AWOKE AND MY FIRST CARE WAS TO VISIT THE FIRE.I UNCOVERED IT AND A GENTLE BREEZE QUICKLY FANNED IT INTO A FLAME. IOBSERVED THIS ALSO AND CONTRIVED A FAN OF BRANCHES WHICH ROUSED THEEMBERS WHEN THEY WERE NEARLY EXTINGUISHED. WHEN NIGHT CAME AGAIN IFOUND WITH PLEASURE THAT THE FIRE GAVE LIGHT AS WELL AS HEAT AND THATTHE DISCOVERY OF THIS ELEMENT WAS USEFUL TO ME IN MY FOOD FOR I FOUNDSOME OF THE OFFALS THAT THE TRAVELLERS HAD LEFT HAD BEEN ROASTED ANDTASTED MUCH MORE SAVOURY THAN THE BERRIES I GATHERED FROM THE TREES. ITRIED THEREFORE TO DRESS MY FOOD IN THE SAME MANNER PLACING IT ONTHE LIVE EMBERS. I FOUND THAT THE BERRIES WERE SPOILED BY THISOPERATION AND THE NUTS AND ROOTS MUCH IMPROVED.FOOD HOWEVER BECAME SCARCE AND I OFTEN SPENT THE WHOLE DAYSEARCHING IN VAIN FOR A FEW ACORNS TO ASSUAGE THE PANGS OF HUNGER. WHENI FOUND THIS I RESOLVED TO QUIT THE PLACE THAT I HAD HITHERTOINHABITED TO SEEK FOR ONE WHERE THE FEW WANTS I EXPERIENCED WOULD BEMORE EASILY SATISFIED. IN THIS EMIGRATION I EXCEEDINGLY LAMENTED THELOSS OF THE FIRE WHICH I HAD OBTAINED THROUGH ACCIDENT AND KNEW NOT HOWTO REPRODUCE IT. I GAVE SEVERAL HOURS TO THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OFTHIS DIFFICULTY BUT I WAS OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH ALL ATTEMPT TO SUPPLYIT AND WRAPPING MYSELF UP IN MY CLOAK I STRUCK ACROSS THE WOODTOWARDS THE SETTING SUN. I PASSED THREE DAYS IN THESE RAMBLES AND ATLENGTH DISCOVERED THE OPEN COUNTRY. A GREAT FALL OF SNOW HAD TAKENPLACE THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE FIELDS WERE OF ONE UNIFORM WHITE THEAPPEARANCE WAS DISCONSOLATE AND I FOUND MY FEET CHILLED BY THE COLDDAMP SUBSTANCE THAT COVERED THE GROUND.IT WAS ABOUT SEVEN IN THE MORNING AND I LONGED TO OBTAIN FOOD ANDSHELTER AT LENGTH I PERCEIVED A SMALL HUT ON A RISING GROUND WHICHHAD DOUBTLESS BEEN BUILT FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF SOME SHEPHERD. THISWAS A NEW SIGHT TO ME AND I EXAMINED THE STRUCTURE WITH GREATCURIOSITY. FINDING THE DOOR OPEN I ENTERED. AN OLD MAN SAT IN ITNEAR A FIRE OVER WHICH HE WAS PREPARING HIS BREAKFAST. HE TURNED ONHEARING A NOISE AND PERCEIVING ME SHRIEKED LOUDLY AND QUITTING THEHUT RAN ACROSS THE FIELDS WITH A SPEED OF WHICH HIS DEBILITATED FORMHARDLY APPEARED CAPABLE. HIS APPEARANCE DIFFERENT FROM ANY I HAD EVERBEFORE SEEN AND HIS FLIGHT SOMEWHAT SURPRISED ME. BUT I WAS ENCHANTEDBY THE APPEARANCE OF THE HUT HERE THE SNOW AND RAIN COULD NOTPENETRATE THE GROUND WAS DRY AND IT PRESENTED TO ME THEN AS EXQUISITEAND DIVINE A RETREAT AS PANDMONIUM APPEARED TO THE DMONS OF HELLAFTER THEIR SUFFERINGS IN THE LAKE OF FIRE. I GREEDILY DEVOURED THEREMNANTS OF THE SHEPHERDS BREAKFAST WHICH CONSISTED OF BREAD CHEESEMILK AND WINE THE LATTER HOWEVER I DID NOT LIKE. THEN OVERCOME BYFATIGUE I LAY DOWN AMONG SOME STRAW AND FELL ASLEEP.IT WAS NOON WHEN I AWOKE AND ALLURED BY THE WARMTH OF THE SUN WHICHSHONE BRIGHTLY ON THE WHITE GROUND I DETERMINED TO RECOMMENCE MYTRAVELS AND DEPOSITING THE REMAINS OF THE PEASANTS BREAKFAST IN AWALLET I FOUND I PROCEEDED ACROSS THE FIELDS FOR SEVERAL HOURS UNTILAT SUNSET I ARRIVED AT A VILLAGE. HOW MIRACULOUS DID THIS APPEAR THEHUTS THE NEATER COTTAGES AND STATELY HOUSES ENGAGED MY ADMIRATION BYTURNS. THE VEGETABLES IN THE GARDENS THE MILK AND CHEESE THAT I SAWPLACED AT THE WINDOWS OF SOME OF THE COTTAGES ALLURED MY APPETITE. ONEOF THE BEST OF THESE I ENTERED BUT I HAD HARDLY PLACED MY FOOT WITHINTHE DOOR BEFORE THE CHILDREN SHRIEKED AND ONE OF THE WOMEN FAINTED.THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS ROUSED SOME FLED SOME ATTACKED ME UNTILGRIEVOUSLY BRUISED BY STONES AND MANY OTHER KINDS OF MISSILE WEAPONS IESCAPED TO THE OPEN COUNTRY AND FEARFULLY TOOK REFUGE IN A LOW HOVELQUITE BARE AND MAKING A WRETCHED APPEARANCE AFTER THE PALACES I HADBEHELD IN THE VILLAGE. THIS HOVEL HOWEVER JOINED A COTTAGE OF A NEATAND PLEASANT APPEARANCE BUT AFTER MY LATE DEARLY BOUGHT EXPERIENCE IDARED NOT ENTER IT. MY PLACE OF REFUGE WAS CONSTRUCTED OF WOOD BUT SOLOW THAT I COULD WITH DIFFICULTY SIT UPRIGHT IN IT. NO WOOD HOWEVERWAS PLACED ON THE EARTH WHICH FORMED THE FLOOR BUT IT WAS DRY ANDALTHOUGH THE WIND ENTERED IT BY INNUMERABLE CHINKS I FOUND IT ANAGREEABLE ASYLUM FROM THE SNOW AND RAIN.HERE THEN I RETREATED AND LAY DOWN HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND A SHELTERHOWEVER MISERABLE FROM THE INCLEMENCY OF THE SEASON AND STILL MOREFROM THE BARBARITY OF MAN. AS SOON AS MORNING DAWNED I CREPT FROM MYKENNEL THAT I MIGHT VIEW THE ADJACENT COTTAGE AND DISCOVER IF I COULDREMAIN IN THE HABITATION I HAD FOUND. IT WAS SITUATED AGAINST THE BACKOF THE COTTAGE AND SURROUNDED ON THE SIDES WHICH WERE EXPOSED BY A PIGSTY AND A CLEAR POOL OF WATER. ONE PART WAS OPEN AND BY THAT I HADCREPT IN BUT NOW I COVERED EVERY CREVICE BY WHICH I MIGHT BE PERCEIVEDWITH STONES AND WOOD YET IN SUCH A MANNER THAT I MIGHT MOVE THEM ONOCCASION TO PASS OUT ALL THE LIGHT I ENJOYED CAME THROUGH THE STY ANDTHAT WAS SUFFICIENT FOR ME.HAVING THUS ARRANGED MY DWELLING AND CARPETED IT WITH CLEAN STRAW IRETIRED FOR I SAW THE FIGURE OF A MAN AT A DISTANCE AND I REMEMBEREDTOO WELL MY TREATMENT THE NIGHT BEFORE TO TRUST MYSELF IN HIS POWER. IHAD FIRST HOWEVER PROVIDED FOR MY SUSTENANCE FOR THAT DAY BY A LOAFOF COARSE BREAD WHICH I PURLOINED AND A CUP WITH WHICH I COULD DRINKMORE CONVENIENTLY THAN FROM MY HAND OF THE PURE WATER WHICH FLOWED BYMY RETREAT. THE FLOOR WAS A LITTLE RAISED SO THAT IT WAS KEPTPERFECTLY DRY AND BY ITS VICINITY TO THE CHIMNEY OF THE COTTAGE IT WASTOLERABLY WARM.BEING THUS PROVIDED I RESOLVED TO RESIDE IN THIS HOVEL UNTILSOMETHING SHOULD OCCUR WHICH MIGHT ALTER MY DETERMINATION. IT WASINDEED A PARADISE COMPARED TO THE BLEAK FOREST MY FORMER RESIDENCETHE RAINDROPPING BRANCHES AND DANK EARTH. I ATE MY BREAKFAST WITHPLEASURE AND WAS ABOUT TO REMOVE A PLANK TO PROCURE MYSELF A LITTLEWATER WHEN I HEARD A STEP AND LOOKING THROUGH A SMALL CHINK I BEHELDA YOUNG CREATURE WITH A PAIL ON HER HEAD PASSING BEFORE MY HOVEL. THEGIRL WAS YOUNG AND OF GENTLE DEMEANOUR UNLIKE WHAT I HAVE SINCE FOUNDCOTTAGERS AND FARMHOUSE SERVANTS TO BE. YET SHE WAS MEANLY DRESSED ACOARSE BLUE PETTICOAT AND A LINEN JACKET BEING HER ONLY GARB HER FAIRHAIR WAS PLAITED BUT NOT ADORNED SHE LOOKED PATIENT YET SAD. I LOSTSIGHT OF HER AND IN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE RETURNED BEARINGTHE PAIL WHICH WAS NOW PARTLY FILLED WITH MILK. AS SHE WALKED ALONGSEEMINGLY INCOMMODED BY THE BURDEN A YOUNG MAN MET HER WHOSECOUNTENANCE EXPRESSED A DEEPER DESPONDENCE. UTTERING A FEW SOUNDS WITHAN AIR OF MELANCHOLY HE TOOK THE PAIL FROM HER HEAD AND BORE IT TO THECOTTAGE HIMSELF. SHE FOLLOWED AND THEY DISAPPEARED. PRESENTLY I SAWTHE YOUNG MAN AGAIN WITH SOME TOOLS IN HIS HAND CROSS THE FIELDBEHIND THE COTTAGE AND THE GIRL WAS ALSO BUSIED SOMETIMES IN THEHOUSE AND SOMETIMES IN THE YARD.ON EXAMINING MY DWELLING I FOUND THAT ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THECOTTAGE HAD FORMERLY OCCUPIED A PART OF IT BUT THE PANES HAD BEENFILLED UP WITH WOOD. IN ONE OF THESE WAS A SMALL AND ALMOSTIMPERCEPTIBLE CHINK THROUGH WHICH THE EYE COULD JUST PENETRATE.THROUGH THIS CREVICE A SMALL ROOM WAS VISIBLE WHITEWASHED AND CLEANBUT VERY BARE OF FURNITURE. IN ONE CORNER NEAR A SMALL FIRE SAT ANOLD MAN LEANING HIS HEAD ON HIS HANDS IN A DISCONSOLATE ATTITUDE. THEYOUNG GIRL WAS OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE BUT PRESENTLY SHETOOK SOMETHING OUT OF A DRAWER WHICH EMPLOYED HER HANDS AND SHE SATDOWN BESIDE THE OLD MAN WHO TAKING UP AN INSTRUMENT BEGAN TO PLAYAND TO PRODUCE SOUNDS SWEETER THAN THE VOICE OF THE THRUSH OR THENIGHTINGALE. IT WAS A LOVELY SIGHT EVEN TO ME POOR WRETCH WHO HADNEVER BEHELD AUGHT BEAUTIFUL BEFORE. THE SILVER HAIR AND BENEVOLENTCOUNTENANCE OF THE AGED COTTAGER WON MY REVERENCE WHILE THE GENTLEMANNERS OF THE GIRL ENTICED MY LOVE. HE PLAYED A SWEET MOURNFUL AIRWHICH I PERCEIVED DREW TEARS FROM THE EYES OF HIS AMIABLE COMPANION OFWHICH THE OLD MAN TOOK NO NOTICE UNTIL SHE SOBBED AUDIBLY HE THENPRONOUNCED A FEW SOUNDS AND THE FAIR CREATURE LEAVING HER WORK KNELTAT HIS FEET. HE RAISED HER AND SMILED WITH SUCH KINDNESS AND AFFECTIONTHAT I FELT SENSATIONS OF A PECULIAR AND OVERPOWERING NATURE THEY WEREA MIXTURE OF PAIN AND PLEASURE SUCH AS I HAD NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCEDEITHER FROM HUNGER OR COLD WARMTH OR FOOD AND I WITHDREW FROM THEWINDOW UNABLE TO BEAR THESE EMOTIONS.SOON AFTER THIS THE YOUNG MAN RETURNED BEARING ON HIS SHOULDERS ALOAD OF WOOD. THE GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR HELPED TO RELIEVE HIM OFHIS BURDEN AND TAKING SOME OF THE FUEL INTO THE COTTAGE PLACED IT ONTHE FIRE THEN SHE AND THE YOUTH WENT APART INTO A NOOK OF THE COTTAGEAND HE SHOWED HER A LARGE LOAF AND A PIECE OF CHEESE. SHE SEEMEDPLEASED AND WENT INTO THE GARDEN FOR SOME ROOTS AND PLANTS WHICH SHEPLACED IN WATER AND THEN UPON THE FIRE. SHE AFTERWARDS CONTINUED HERWORK WHILST THE YOUNG MAN WENT INTO THE GARDEN AND APPEARED BUSILYEMPLOYED IN DIGGING AND PULLING UP ROOTS. AFTER HE HAD BEEN EMPLOYEDTHUS ABOUT AN HOUR THE YOUNG WOMAN JOINED HIM AND THEY ENTERED THECOTTAGE TOGETHER.THE OLD MAN HAD IN THE MEANTIME BEEN PENSIVE BUT ON THE APPEARANCEOF HIS COMPANIONS HE ASSUMED A MORE CHEERFUL AIR AND THEY SAT DOWN TOEAT. THE MEAL WAS QUICKLY DISPATCHED. THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS AGAINOCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE THE OLD MAN WALKED BEFORE THECOTTAGE IN THE SUN FOR A FEW MINUTES LEANING ON THE ARM OF THE YOUTH.NOTHING COULD EXCEED IN BEAUTY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THESE TWO EXCELLENTCREATURES. ONE WAS OLD WITH SILVER HAIRS AND A COUNTENANCE BEAMINGWITH BENEVOLENCE AND LOVE THE YOUNGER WAS SLIGHT AND GRACEFUL IN HISFIGURE AND HIS FEATURES WERE MOULDED WITH THE FINEST SYMMETRY YET HISEYES AND ATTITUDE EXPRESSED THE UTMOST SADNESS AND DESPONDENCY. THEOLD MAN RETURNED TO THE COTTAGE AND THE YOUTH WITH TOOLS DIFFERENTFROM THOSE HE HAD USED IN THE MORNING DIRECTED HIS STEPS ACROSS THEFIELDS.NIGHT QUICKLY SHUT IN BUT TO MY EXTREME WONDER I FOUND THAT THECOTTAGERS HAD A MEANS OF PROLONGING LIGHT BY THE USE OF TAPERS AND WASDELIGHTED TO FIND THAT THE SETTING OF THE SUN DID NOT PUT AN END TO THEPLEASURE I EXPERIENCED IN WATCHING MY HUMAN NEIGHBOURS. IN THE EVENINGTHE YOUNG GIRL AND HER COMPANION WERE EMPLOYED IN VARIOUS OCCUPATIONSWHICH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND AND THE OLD MAN AGAIN TOOK UP THEINSTRUMENT WHICH PRODUCED THE DIVINE SOUNDS THAT HAD ENCHANTED ME INTHE MORNING. SO SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED THE YOUTH BEGAN NOT TO PLAYBUT TO UTTER SOUNDS THAT WERE MONOTONOUS AND NEITHER RESEMBLING THEHARMONY OF THE OLD MANS INSTRUMENT NOR THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS I SINCEFOUND THAT HE READ ALOUD BUT AT THAT TIME I KNEW NOTHING OF THESCIENCE OF WORDS OR LETTERS.THE FAMILY AFTER HAVING BEEN THUS OCCUPIED FOR A SHORT TIMEEXTINGUISHED THEIR LIGHTS AND RETIRED AS I CONJECTURED TO REST.CHAPTER I LAY ON MY STRAW BUT I COULD NOT SLEEP. I THOUGHT OF THEOCCURRENCES OF THE DAY. WHAT CHIEFLY STRUCK ME WAS THE GENTLE MANNERSOF THESE PEOPLE AND I LONGED TO JOIN THEM BUT DARED NOT. IREMEMBERED TOO WELL THE TREATMENT I HAD SUFFERED THE NIGHT BEFORE FROMTHE BARBAROUS VILLAGERS AND RESOLVED WHATEVER COURSE OF CONDUCT IMIGHT HEREAFTER THINK IT RIGHT TO PURSUE THAT FOR THE PRESENT I WOULDREMAIN QUIETLY IN MY HOVEL WATCHING AND ENDEAVOURING TO DISCOVER THEMOTIVES WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR ACTIONS.THE COTTAGERS AROSE THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE SUN. THE YOUNG WOMANARRANGED THE COTTAGE AND PREPARED THE FOOD AND THE YOUTH DEPARTEDAFTER THE FIRST MEAL.THIS DAY WAS PASSED IN THE SAME ROUTINE AS THAT WHICH PRECEDED IT.THE YOUNG MAN WAS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED OUT OF DOORS AND THE GIRL INVARIOUS LABORIOUS OCCUPATIONS WITHIN. THE OLD MAN WHOM I SOONPERCEIVED TO BE BLIND EMPLOYED HIS LEISURE HOURS ON HIS INSTRUMENT ORIN CONTEMPLATION. NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE LOVE AND RESPECT WHICH THEYOUNGER COTTAGERS EXHIBITED TOWARDS THEIR VENERABLE COMPANION. THEYPERFORMED TOWARDS HIM EVERY LITTLE OFFICE OF AFFECTION AND DUTY WITHGENTLENESS AND HE REWARDED THEM BY HIS BENEVOLENT SMILES.THEY WERE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY. THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS COMPANION OFTENWENT APART AND APPEARED TO WEEP. I SAW NO CAUSE FOR THEIR UNHAPPINESSBUT I WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY IT. IF SUCH LOVELY CREATURES WEREMISERABLE IT WAS LESS STRANGE THAT I AN IMPERFECT AND SOLITARY BEINGSHOULD BE WRETCHED. YET WHY WERE THESE GENTLE BEINGS UNHAPPY THEYPOSSESSED A DELIGHTFUL HOUSE FOR SUCH IT WAS IN MY EYES AND EVERYLUXURY THEY HAD A FIRE TO WARM THEM WHEN CHILL AND DELICIOUS VIANDSWHEN HUNGRY THEY WERE DRESSED IN EXCELLENT CLOTHES AND STILL MORETHEY ENJOYED ONE ANOTHERS COMPANY AND SPEECH INTERCHANGING EACH DAYLOOKS OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS. WHAT DID THEIR TEARS IMPLY DID THEYREALLY EXPRESS PAIN I WAS AT FIRST UNABLE TO SOLVE THESE QUESTIONSBUT PERPETUAL ATTENTION AND TIME EXPLAINED TO ME MANY APPEARANCES WHICHWERE AT FIRST ENIGMATIC.A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD ELAPSED BEFORE I DISCOVERED ONE OF THE CAUSES OFTHE UNEASINESS OF THIS AMIABLE FAMILY IT WAS POVERTY AND THEYSUFFERED THAT EVIL IN A VERY DISTRESSING DEGREE. THEIR NOURISHMENTCONSISTED ENTIRELY OF THE VEGETABLES OF THEIR GARDEN AND THE MILK OFONE COW WHICH GAVE VERY LITTLE DURING THE WINTER WHEN ITS MASTERSCOULD SCARCELY PROCURE FOOD TO SUPPORT IT. THEY OFTEN I BELIEVESUFFERED THE PANGS OF HUNGER VERY POIGNANTLY ESPECIALLY THE TWOYOUNGER COTTAGERS FOR SEVERAL TIMES THEY PLACED FOOD BEFORE THE OLDMAN WHEN THEY RESERVED NONE FOR THEMSELVES.THIS TRAIT OF KINDNESS MOVED ME SENSIBLY. I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMEDDURING THE NIGHT TO STEAL A PART OF THEIR STORE FOR MY OWNCONSUMPTION BUT WHEN I FOUND THAT IN DOING THIS I INFLICTED PAIN ONTHE COTTAGERS I ABSTAINED AND SATISFIED MYSELF WITH BERRIES NUTS ANDROOTS WHICH I GATHERED FROM A NEIGHBOURING WOOD.I DISCOVERED ALSO ANOTHER MEANS THROUGH WHICH I WAS ENABLED TO ASSISTTHEIR LABOURS. I FOUND THAT THE YOUTH SPENT A GREAT PART OF EACH DAYIN COLLECTING WOOD FOR THE FAMILY FIRE AND DURING THE NIGHT I OFTENTOOK HIS TOOLS THE USE OF WHICH I QUICKLY DISCOVERED AND BROUGHT HOMEFIRING SUFFICIENT FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF SEVERAL DAYS.I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME THAT I DID THIS THE YOUNG WOMAN WHEN SHEOPENED THE DOOR IN THE MORNING APPEARED GREATLY ASTONISHED ON SEEING A GREATPILE OF WOOD ON THE OUTSIDE. SHE UTTERED SOME WORDS IN A LOUD VOICE AND THEYOUTH JOINED HER WHO ALSO EXPRESSED SURPRISE. I OBSERVED WITH PLEASURETHAT HE DID NOT GO TO THE FOREST THAT DAY BUT SPENT IT IN REPAIRING THECOTTAGE AND CULTIVATING THE GARDEN.BY DEGREES I MADE A DISCOVERY OF STILL GREATER MOMENT. I FOUND THATTHESE PEOPLE POSSESSED A METHOD OF COMMUNICATING THEIR EXPERIENCE ANDFEELINGS TO ONE ANOTHER BY ARTICULATE SOUNDS. I PERCEIVED THAT THE WORDSTHEY SPOKE SOMETIMES PRODUCED PLEASURE OR PAIN SMILES OR SADNESS IN THEMINDS AND COUNTENANCES OF THE HEARERS. THIS WAS INDEED A GODLIKE SCIENCEAND I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH IT. BUT I WAS BAFFLED INEVERY ATTEMPT I MADE FOR THIS PURPOSE. THEIR PRONUNCIATION WAS QUICK ANDTHE WORDS THEY UTTERED NOT HAVING ANY APPARENT CONNECTION WITH VISIBLEOBJECTS I WAS UNABLE TO DISCOVER ANY CLUE BY WHICH I COULD UNRAVEL THEMYSTERY OF THEIR REFERENCE. BY GREAT APPLICATION HOWEVER AND AFTER HAVINGREMAINED DURING THE SPACE OF SEVERAL REVOLUTIONS OF THE MOON IN MY HOVEL IDISCOVERED THE NAMES THAT WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE MOST FAMILIAR OBJECTS OFDISCOURSE I LEARNED AND APPLIED THE WORDS FIRE MILK BREAD ANDWOOD. I LEARNED ALSO THE NAMES OF THE COTTAGERS THEMSELVES. THE YOUTHAND HIS COMPANION HAD EACH OF THEM SEVERAL NAMES BUT THE OLD MAN HAD ONLYONE WHICH WAS FATHER. THE GIRL WAS CALLED SISTER ORAGATHA AND THE YOUTH FELIX BROTHER OR SON. I CANNOTDESCRIBE THE DELIGHT I FELT WHEN I LEARNED THE IDEAS APPROPRIATED TO EACH OFTHESE SOUNDS AND WAS ABLE TO PRONOUNCE THEM. I DISTINGUISHED SEVERAL OTHERWORDS WITHOUT BEING ABLE AS YET TO UNDERSTAND OR APPLY THEM SUCH AS GOODDEAREST UNHAPPY.I SPENT THE WINTER IN THIS MANNER. THE GENTLE MANNERS AND BEAUTY OFTHE COTTAGERS GREATLY ENDEARED THEM TO ME WHEN THEY WERE UNHAPPY IFELT DEPRESSED WHEN THEY REJOICED I SYMPATHISED IN THEIR JOYS. I SAWFEW HUMAN BEINGS BESIDES THEM AND IF ANY OTHER HAPPENED TO ENTER THECOTTAGE THEIR HARSH MANNERS AND RUDE GAIT ONLY ENHANCED TO ME THESUPERIOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF MY FRIENDS. THE OLD MAN I COULD PERCEIVEOFTEN ENDEAVOURED TO ENCOURAGE HIS CHILDREN AS SOMETIMES I FOUND THATHE CALLED THEM TO CAST OFF THEIR MELANCHOLY. HE WOULD TALK IN ACHEERFUL ACCENT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF GOODNESS THAT BESTOWED PLEASUREEVEN UPON ME. AGATHA LISTENED WITH RESPECT HER EYES SOMETIMES FILLEDWITH TEARS WHICH SHE ENDEAVOURED TO WIPE AWAY UNPERCEIVED BUT IGENERALLY FOUND THAT HER COUNTENANCE AND TONE WERE MORE CHEERFUL AFTERHAVING LISTENED TO THE EXHORTATIONS OF HER FATHER. IT WAS NOT THUSWITH FELIX. HE WAS ALWAYS THE SADDEST OF THE GROUP AND EVEN TO MYUNPRACTISED SENSES HE APPEARED TO HAVE SUFFERED MORE DEEPLY THAN HISFRIENDS. BUT IF HIS COUNTENANCE WAS MORE SORROWFUL HIS VOICE WAS MORECHEERFUL THAN THAT OF HIS SISTER ESPECIALLY WHEN HE ADDRESSED THE OLDMAN.I COULD MENTION INNUMERABLE INSTANCES WHICH ALTHOUGH SLIGHT MARKEDTHE DISPOSITIONS OF THESE AMIABLE COTTAGERS. IN THE MIDST OF POVERTYAND WANT FELIX CARRIED WITH PLEASURE TO HIS SISTER THE FIRST LITTLEWHITE FLOWER THAT PEEPED OUT FROM BENEATH THE SNOWY GROUND. EARLY INTHE MORNING BEFORE SHE HAD RISEN HE CLEARED AWAY THE SNOW THATOBSTRUCTED HER PATH TO THE MILKHOUSE DREW WATER FROM THE WELL ANDBROUGHT THE WOOD FROM THE OUTHOUSE WHERE TO HIS PERPETUALASTONISHMENT HE FOUND HIS STORE ALWAYS REPLENISHED BY AN INVISIBLEHAND. IN THE DAY I BELIEVE HE WORKED SOMETIMES FOR A NEIGHBOURINGFARMER BECAUSE HE OFTEN WENT FORTH AND DID NOT RETURN UNTIL DINNERYET BROUGHT NO WOOD WITH HIM. AT OTHER TIMES HE WORKED IN THE GARDENBUT AS THERE WAS LITTLE TO DO IN THE FROSTY SEASON HE READ TO THE OLDMAN AND AGATHA.THIS READING HAD PUZZLED ME EXTREMELY AT FIRST BUT BY DEGREES IDISCOVERED THAT HE UTTERED MANY OF THE SAME SOUNDS WHEN HE READ AS WHENHE TALKED. I CONJECTURED THEREFORE THAT HE FOUND ON THE PAPER SIGNSFOR SPEECH WHICH HE UNDERSTOOD AND I ARDENTLY LONGED TO COMPREHENDTHESE ALSO BUT HOW WAS THAT POSSIBLE WHEN I DID NOT EVEN UNDERSTANDTHE SOUNDS FOR WHICH THEY STOOD AS SIGNS I IMPROVED HOWEVERSENSIBLY IN THIS SCIENCE BUT NOT SUFFICIENTLY TO FOLLOW UP ANY KIND OFCONVERSATION ALTHOUGH I APPLIED MY WHOLE MIND TO THE ENDEAVOUR FOR IEASILY PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH I EAGERLY LONGED TO DISCOVER MYSELF TOTHE COTTAGERS I OUGHT NOT TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT UNTIL I HAD FIRST BECOMEMASTER OF THEIR LANGUAGE WHICH KNOWLEDGE MIGHT ENABLE ME TO MAKE THEMOVERLOOK THE DEFORMITY OF MY FIGURE FOR WITH THIS ALSO THE CONTRASTPERPETUALLY PRESENTED TO MY EYES HAD MADE ME ACQUAINTED.I HAD ADMIRED THE PERFECT FORMS OF MY COTTAGERSTHEIR GRACE BEAUTYAND DELICATE COMPLEXIONS BUT HOW WAS I TERRIFIED WHEN I VIEWED MYSELFIN A TRANSPARENT POOL AT FIRST I STARTED BACK UNABLE TO BELIEVE THATIT WAS INDEED I WHO WAS REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR AND WHEN I BECAMEFULLY CONVINCED THAT I WAS IN REALITY THE MONSTER THAT I AM I WASFILLED WITH THE BITTEREST SENSATIONS OF DESPONDENCE AND MORTIFICATION.ALAS I DID NOT YET ENTIRELY KNOW THE FATAL EFFECTS OF THIS MISERABLEDEFORMITY.AS THE SUN BECAME WARMER AND THE LIGHT OF DAY LONGER THE SNOWVANISHED AND I BEHELD THE BARE TREES AND THE BLACK EARTH. FROM THISTIME FELIX WAS MORE EMPLOYED AND THE HEARTMOVING INDICATIONS OFIMPENDING FAMINE DISAPPEARED. THEIR FOOD AS I AFTERWARDS FOUND WASCOARSE BUT IT WAS WHOLESOME AND THEY PROCURED A SUFFICIENCY OF IT.SEVERAL NEW KINDS OF PLANTS SPRANG UP IN THE GARDEN WHICH THEYDRESSED AND THESE SIGNS OF COMFORT INCREASED DAILY AS THE SEASONADVANCED.THE OLD MAN LEANING ON HIS SON WALKED EACH DAY AT NOON WHEN IT DIDNOT RAIN AS I FOUND IT WAS CALLED WHEN THE HEAVENS POURED FORTH ITSWATERS. THIS FREQUENTLY TOOK PLACE BUT A HIGH WIND QUICKLY DRIED THEEARTH AND THE SEASON BECAME FAR MORE PLEASANT THAN IT HAD BEEN.MY MODE OF LIFE IN MY HOVEL WAS UNIFORM. DURING THE MORNING IATTENDED THE MOTIONS OF THE COTTAGERS AND WHEN THEY WERE DISPERSED INVARIOUS OCCUPATIONS I SLEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY WAS SPENT INOBSERVING MY FRIENDS. WHEN THEY HAD RETIRED TO REST IF THERE WAS ANYMOON OR THE NIGHT WAS STARLIGHT I WENT INTO THE WOODS AND COLLECTEDMY OWN FOOD AND FUEL FOR THE COTTAGE. WHEN I RETURNED AS OFTEN AS ITWAS NECESSARY I CLEARED THEIR PATH FROM THE SNOW AND PERFORMED THOSEOFFICES THAT I HAD SEEN DONE BY FELIX. I AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT THESELABOURS PERFORMED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND GREATLY ASTONISHED THEM ANDONCE OR TWICE I HEARD THEM ON THESE OCCASIONS UTTER THE WORDS GOODSPIRIT WONDERFUL BUT I DID NOT THEN UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICATIONOF THESE TERMS.MY THOUGHTS NOW BECAME MORE ACTIVE AND I LONGED TO DISCOVER THEMOTIVES AND FEELINGS OF THESE LOVELY CREATURES I WAS INQUISITIVE TOKNOW WHY FELIX APPEARED SO MISERABLE AND AGATHA SO SAD. I THOUGHTFOOLISH WRETCH THAT IT MIGHT BE IN MY POWER TO RESTORE HAPPINESS TOTHESE DESERVING PEOPLE. WHEN I SLEPT OR WAS ABSENT THE FORMS OF THEVENERABLE BLIND FATHER THE GENTLE AGATHA AND THE EXCELLENT FELIXFLITTED BEFORE ME. I LOOKED UPON THEM AS SUPERIOR BEINGS WHO WOULD BETHE ARBITERS OF MY FUTURE DESTINY. I FORMED IN MY IMAGINATION ATHOUSAND PICTURES OF PRESENTING MYSELF TO THEM AND THEIR RECEPTION OFME. I IMAGINED THAT THEY WOULD BE DISGUSTED UNTIL BY MY GENTLEDEMEANOUR AND CONCILIATING WORDS I SHOULD FIRST WIN THEIR FAVOUR ANDAFTERWARDS THEIR LOVE.THESE THOUGHTS EXHILARATED ME AND LED ME TO APPLY WITH FRESH ARDOUR TOTHE ACQUIRING THE ART OF LANGUAGE. MY ORGANS WERE INDEED HARSH BUTSUPPLE AND ALTHOUGH MY VOICE WAS VERY UNLIKE THE SOFT MUSIC OF THEIRTONES YET I PRONOUNCED SUCH WORDS AS I UNDERSTOOD WITH TOLERABLE EASE.IT WAS AS THE ASS AND THE LAPDOG YET SURELY THE GENTLE ASS WHOSEINTENTIONS WERE AFFECTIONATE ALTHOUGH HIS MANNERS WERE RUDE DESERVEDBETTER TREATMENT THAN BLOWS AND EXECRATION.THE PLEASANT SHOWERS AND GENIAL WARMTH OF SPRING GREATLY ALTERED THEASPECT OF THE EARTH. MEN WHO BEFORE THIS CHANGE SEEMED TO HAVE BEENHID IN CAVES DISPERSED THEMSELVES AND WERE EMPLOYED IN VARIOUS ARTS OFCULTIVATION. THE BIRDS SANG IN MORE CHEERFUL NOTES AND THE LEAVESBEGAN TO BUD FORTH ON THE TREES. HAPPY HAPPY EARTH FIT HABITATIONFOR GODS WHICH SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE WAS BLEAK DAMP ANDUNWHOLESOME. MY SPIRITS WERE ELEVATED BY THE ENCHANTING APPEARANCE OFNATURE THE PAST WAS BLOTTED FROM MY MEMORY THE PRESENT WAS TRANQUILAND THE FUTURE GILDED BY BRIGHT RAYS OF HOPE AND ANTICIPATIONS OF JOY.CHAPTER I NOW HASTEN TO THE MORE MOVING PART OF MY STORY. I SHALL RELATEEVENTS THAT IMPRESSED ME WITH FEELINGS WHICH FROM WHAT I HAD BEENHAVE MADE ME WHAT I AM.SPRING ADVANCED RAPIDLY THE WEATHER BECAME FINE AND THE SKIESCLOUDLESS. IT SURPRISED ME THAT WHAT BEFORE WAS DESERT AND GLOOMYSHOULD NOW BLOOM WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND VERDURE. MYSENSES WERE GRATIFIED AND REFRESHED BY A THOUSAND SCENTS OF DELIGHT ANDA THOUSAND SIGHTS OF BEAUTY.IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE DAYS WHEN MY COTTAGERS PERIODICALLY RESTEDFROM LABOURTHE OLD MAN PLAYED ON HIS GUITAR AND THE CHILDRENLISTENED TO HIMTHAT I OBSERVED THE COUNTENANCE OF FELIX WASMELANCHOLY BEYOND EXPRESSION HE SIGHED FREQUENTLY AND ONCE HIS FATHERPAUSED IN HIS MUSIC AND I CONJECTURED BY HIS MANNER THAT HE INQUIREDTHE CAUSE OF HIS SONS SORROW. FELIX REPLIED IN A CHEERFUL ACCENT ANDTHE OLD MAN WAS RECOMMENCING HIS MUSIC WHEN SOMEONE TAPPED AT THE DOOR.IT WAS A LADY ON HORSEBACK ACCOMPANIED BY A COUNTRYMAN AS A GUIDE.THE LADY WAS DRESSED IN A DARK SUIT AND COVERED WITH A THICK BLACKVEIL. AGATHA ASKED A QUESTION TO WHICH THE STRANGER ONLY REPLIED BYPRONOUNCING IN A SWEET ACCENT THE NAME OF FELIX. HER VOICE WASMUSICAL BUT UNLIKE THAT OF EITHER OF MY FRIENDS. ON HEARING THIS WORDFELIX CAME UP HASTILY TO THE LADY WHO WHEN SHE SAW HIM THREW UP HERVEIL AND I BEHELD A COUNTENANCE OF ANGELIC BEAUTY AND EXPRESSION. HERHAIR OF A SHINING RAVEN BLACK AND CURIOUSLY BRAIDED HER EYES WEREDARK BUT GENTLE ALTHOUGH ANIMATED HER FEATURES OF A REGULARPROPORTION AND HER COMPLEXION WONDROUSLY FAIR EACH CHEEK TINGED WITHA LOVELY PINK.FELIX SEEMED RAVISHED WITH DELIGHT WHEN HE SAW HER EVERY TRAIT OFSORROW VANISHED FROM HIS FACE AND IT INSTANTLY EXPRESSED A DEGREE OFECSTATIC JOY OF WHICH I COULD HARDLY HAVE BELIEVED IT CAPABLE HISEYES SPARKLED AS HIS CHEEK FLUSHED WITH PLEASURE AND AT THAT MOMENT ITHOUGHT HIM AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE STRANGER. SHE APPEARED AFFECTED BYDIFFERENT FEELINGS WIPING A FEW TEARS FROM HER LOVELY EYES SHE HELDOUT HER HAND TO FELIX WHO KISSED IT RAPTUROUSLY AND CALLED HER ASWELL AS I COULD DISTINGUISH HIS SWEET ARABIAN. SHE DID NOT APPEAR TOUNDERSTAND HIM BUT SMILED. HE ASSISTED HER TO DISMOUNT ANDDISMISSING HER GUIDE CONDUCTED HER INTO THE COTTAGE. SOMECONVERSATION TOOK PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND HIS FATHER AND THE YOUNGSTRANGER KNELT AT THE OLD MANS FEET AND WOULD HAVE KISSED HIS HANDBUT HE RAISED HER AND EMBRACED HER AFFECTIONATELY.I SOON PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH THE STRANGER UTTERED ARTICULATE SOUNDSAND APPEARED TO HAVE A LANGUAGE OF HER OWN SHE WAS NEITHER UNDERSTOODBY NOR HERSELF UNDERSTOOD THE COTTAGERS. THEY MADE MANY SIGNS WHICH IDID NOT COMPREHEND BUT I SAW THAT HER PRESENCE DIFFUSED GLADNESSTHROUGH THE COTTAGE DISPELLING THEIR SORROW AS THE SUN DISSIPATES THEMORNING MISTS. FELIX SEEMED PECULIARLY HAPPY AND WITH SMILES OFDELIGHT WELCOMED HIS ARABIAN. AGATHA THE EVERGENTLE AGATHA KISSEDTHE HANDS OF THE LOVELY STRANGER AND POINTING TO HER BROTHER MADESIGNS WHICH APPEARED TO ME TO MEAN THAT HE HAD BEEN SORROWFUL UNTIL SHECAME. SOME HOURS PASSED THUS WHILE THEY BY THEIR COUNTENANCESEXPRESSED JOY THE CAUSE OF WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND. PRESENTLY IFOUND BY THE FREQUENT RECURRENCE OF SOME SOUND WHICH THE STRANGERREPEATED AFTER THEM THAT SHE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGEAND THE IDEA INSTANTLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD MAKE USE OF THESAME INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SAME END. THE STRANGER LEARNED ABOUT TWENTYWORDS AT THE FIRST LESSON MOST OF THEM INDEED WERE THOSE WHICH I HADBEFORE UNDERSTOOD BUT I PROFITED BY THE OTHERS.AS NIGHT CAME ON AGATHA AND THE ARABIAN RETIRED EARLY. WHEN THEYSEPARATED FELIX KISSED THE HAND OF THE STRANGER AND SAID GOOD NIGHTSWEET SAFIE. HE SAT UP MUCH LONGER CONVERSING WITH HIS FATHER ANDBY THE FREQUENT REPETITION OF HER NAME I CONJECTURED THAT THEIR LOVELYGUEST WAS THE SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION. I ARDENTLY DESIRED TOUNDERSTAND THEM AND BENT EVERY FACULTY TOWARDS THAT PURPOSE BUT FOUNDIT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE.THE NEXT MORNING FELIX WENT OUT TO HIS WORK AND AFTER THE USUALOCCUPATIONS OF AGATHA WERE FINISHED THE ARABIAN SAT AT THE FEET OF THEOLD MAN AND TAKING HIS GUITAR PLAYED SOME AIRS SO ENTRANCINGLYBEAUTIFUL THAT THEY AT ONCE DREW TEARS OF SORROW AND DELIGHT FROM MYEYES. SHE SANG AND HER VOICE FLOWED IN A RICH CADENCE SWELLING ORDYING AWAY LIKE A NIGHTINGALE OF THE WOODS.WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE GAVE THE GUITAR TO AGATHA WHO AT FIRSTDECLINED IT. SHE PLAYED A SIMPLE AIR AND HER VOICE ACCOMPANIED IT INSWEET ACCENTS BUT UNLIKE THE WONDROUS STRAIN OF THE STRANGER. THE OLDMAN APPEARED ENRAPTURED AND SAID SOME WORDS WHICH AGATHA ENDEAVOURED TOEXPLAIN TO SAFIE AND BY WHICH HE APPEARED TO WISH TO EXPRESS THAT SHEBESTOWED ON HIM THE GREATEST DELIGHT BY HER MUSIC.THE DAYS NOW PASSED AS PEACEABLY AS BEFORE WITH THE SOLE ALTERATIONTHAT JOY HAD TAKEN PLACE OF SADNESS IN THE COUNTENANCES OF MY FRIENDS.SAFIE WAS ALWAYS GAY AND HAPPY SHE AND I IMPROVED RAPIDLY IN THEKNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGE SO THAT IN TWO MONTHS I BEGAN TO COMPREHEND MOSTOF THE WORDS UTTERED BY MY PROTECTORS.IN THE MEANWHILE ALSO THE BLACK GROUND WAS COVERED WITH HERBAGE ANDTHE GREEN BANKS INTERSPERSED WITH INNUMERABLE FLOWERS SWEET TO THESCENT AND THE EYES STARS OF PALE RADIANCE AMONG THE MOONLIGHT WOODSTHE SUN BECAME WARMER THE NIGHTS CLEAR AND BALMY AND MY NOCTURNALRAMBLES WERE AN EXTREME PLEASURE TO ME ALTHOUGH THEY WERE CONSIDERABLYSHORTENED BY THE LATE SETTING AND EARLY RISING OF THE SUN FOR I NEVERVENTURED ABROAD DURING DAYLIGHT FEARFUL OF MEETING WITH THE SAMETREATMENT I HAD FORMERLY ENDURED IN THE FIRST VILLAGE WHICH I ENTERED.MY DAYS WERE SPENT IN CLOSE ATTENTION THAT I MIGHT MORE SPEEDILYMASTER THE LANGUAGE AND I MAY BOAST THAT I IMPROVED MORE RAPIDLY THANTHE ARABIAN WHO UNDERSTOOD VERY LITTLE AND CONVERSED IN BROKENACCENTS WHILST I COMPREHENDED AND COULD IMITATE ALMOST EVERY WORD THATWAS SPOKEN.WHILE I IMPROVED IN SPEECH I ALSO LEARNED THE SCIENCE OF LETTERS ASIT WAS TAUGHT TO THE STRANGER AND THIS OPENED BEFORE ME A WIDE FIELDFOR WONDER AND DELIGHT.THE BOOK FROM WHICH FELIX INSTRUCTED SAFIE WAS VOLNEYS RUINSOF EMPIRES. I SHOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE PURPORT OF THIS BOOK HAD NOTFELIX IN READING IT GIVEN VERY MINUTE EXPLANATIONS. HE HAD CHOSEN THISWORK HE SAID BECAUSE THE DECLAMATORY STYLE WAS FRAMED IN IMITATION OF THEEASTERN AUTHORS. THROUGH THIS WORK I OBTAINED A CURSORY KNOWLEDGE OF HISTORYAND A VIEW OF THE SEVERAL EMPIRES AT PRESENT EXISTING IN THE WORLD IT GAVEME AN INSIGHT INTO THE MANNERS GOVERNMENTS AND RELIGIONS OF THE DIFFERENTNATIONS OF THE EARTH. I HEARD OF THE SLOTHFUL ASIATICS OF THE STUPENDOUSGENIUS AND MENTAL ACTIVITY OF THE GRECIANS OF THE WARS AND WONDERFUL VIRTUEOF THE EARLY ROMANSOF THEIR SUBSEQUENT DEGENERATINGOF THEDECLINE OF THAT MIGHTY EMPIRE OF CHIVALRY CHRISTIANITY AND KINGS. I HEARDOF THE DISCOVERY OF THE AMERICAN HEMISPHERE AND WEPT WITH SAFIE OVER THEHAPLESS FATE OF ITS ORIGINAL INHABITANTS.THESE WONDERFUL NARRATIONS INSPIRED ME WITH STRANGE FEELINGS. WASMAN INDEED AT ONCE SO POWERFUL SO VIRTUOUS AND MAGNIFICENT YET SOVICIOUS AND BASE HE APPEARED AT ONE TIME A MERE SCION OF THE EVILPRINCIPLE AND AT ANOTHER AS ALL THAT CAN BE CONCEIVED OF NOBLE ANDGODLIKE. TO BE A GREAT AND VIRTUOUS MAN APPEARED THE HIGHEST HONOURTHAT CAN BEFALL A SENSITIVE BEING TO BE BASE AND VICIOUS AS MANY ONRECORD HAVE BEEN APPEARED THE LOWEST DEGRADATION A CONDITION MOREABJECT THAN THAT OF THE BLIND MOLE OR HARMLESS WORM. FOR A LONG TIME ICOULD NOT CONCEIVE HOW ONE MAN COULD GO FORTH TO MURDER HIS FELLOW OREVEN WHY THERE WERE LAWS AND GOVERNMENTS BUT WHEN I HEARD DETAILS OFVICE AND BLOODSHED MY WONDER CEASED AND I TURNED AWAY WITH DISGUST ANDLOATHING.EVERY CONVERSATION OF THE COTTAGERS NOW OPENED NEW WONDERS TO ME.WHILE I LISTENED TO THE INSTRUCTIONS WHICH FELIX BESTOWED UPON THEARABIAN THE STRANGE SYSTEM OF HUMAN SOCIETY WAS EXPLAINED TO ME. IHEARD OF THE DIVISION OF PROPERTY OF IMMENSE WEALTH AND SQUALIDPOVERTY OF RANK DESCENT AND NOBLE BLOOD.THE WORDS INDUCED ME TO TURN TOWARDS MYSELF. I LEARNED THAT THEPOSSESSIONS MOST ESTEEMED BY YOUR FELLOW CREATURES WERE HIGH ANDUNSULLIED DESCENT UNITED WITH RICHES. A MAN MIGHT BE RESPECTED WITHONLY ONE OF THESE ADVANTAGES BUT WITHOUT EITHER HE WAS CONSIDEREDEXCEPT IN VERY RARE INSTANCES AS A VAGABOND AND A SLAVE DOOMED TOWASTE HIS POWERS FOR THE PROFITS OF THE CHOSEN FEW AND WHAT WAS I OFMY CREATION AND CREATOR I WAS ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT BUT I KNEW THAT IPOSSESSED NO MONEY NO FRIENDS NO KIND OF PROPERTY. I WAS BESIDESENDUED WITH A FIGURE HIDEOUSLY DEFORMED AND LOATHSOME I WAS NOT EVENOF THE SAME NATURE AS MAN. I WAS MORE AGILE THAN THEY AND COULDSUBSIST UPON COARSER DIET I BORE THE EXTREMES OF HEAT AND COLD WITHLESS INJURY TO MY FRAME MY STATURE FAR EXCEEDED THEIRS. WHEN I LOOKEDAROUND I SAW AND HEARD OF NONE LIKE ME. WAS I THEN A MONSTER A BLOTUPON THE EARTH FROM WHICH ALL MEN FLED AND WHOM ALL MEN DISOWNEDI CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU THE AGONY THAT THESE REFLECTIONS INFLICTEDUPON ME I TRIED TO DISPEL THEM BUT SORROW ONLY INCREASED WITHKNOWLEDGE. OH THAT I HAD FOR EVER REMAINED IN MY NATIVE WOOD NORKNOWN NOR FELT BEYOND THE SENSATIONS OF HUNGER THIRST AND HEATOF WHAT A STRANGE NATURE IS KNOWLEDGE IT CLINGS TO THE MIND WHEN ITHAS ONCE SEIZED ON IT LIKE A LICHEN ON THE ROCK. I WISHED SOMETIMES TOSHAKE OFF ALL THOUGHT AND FEELING BUT I LEARNED THAT THERE WAS BUT ONEMEANS TO OVERCOME THE SENSATION OF PAIN AND THAT WAS DEATHA STATEWHICH I FEARED YET DID NOT UNDERSTAND. I ADMIRED VIRTUE AND GOODFEELINGS AND LOVED THE GENTLE MANNERS AND AMIABLE QUALITIES OF MYCOTTAGERS BUT I WAS SHUT OUT FROM INTERCOURSE WITH THEM EXCEPTTHROUGH MEANS WHICH I OBTAINED BY STEALTH WHEN I WAS UNSEEN ANDUNKNOWN AND WHICH RATHER INCREASED THAN SATISFIED THE DESIRE I HAD OFBECOMING ONE AMONG MY FELLOWS. THE GENTLE WORDS OF AGATHA AND THEANIMATED SMILES OF THE CHARMING ARABIAN WERE NOT FOR ME. THE MILDEXHORTATIONS OF THE OLD MAN AND THE LIVELY CONVERSATION OF THE LOVEDFELIX WERE NOT FOR ME. MISERABLE UNHAPPY WRETCHOTHER LESSONS WERE IMPRESSED UPON ME EVEN MORE DEEPLY. I HEARD OF THEDIFFERENCE OF SEXES AND THE BIRTH AND GROWTH OF CHILDREN HOW THEFATHER DOTED ON THE SMILES OF THE INFANT AND THE LIVELY SALLIES OF THEOLDER CHILD HOW ALL THE LIFE AND CARES OF THE MOTHER WERE WRAPPED UPIN THE PRECIOUS CHARGE HOW THE MIND OF YOUTH EXPANDED AND GAINEDKNOWLEDGE OF BROTHER SISTER AND ALL THE VARIOUS RELATIONSHIPS WHICHBIND ONE HUMAN BEING TO ANOTHER IN MUTUAL BONDS.BUT WHERE WERE MY FRIENDS AND RELATIONS NO FATHER HAD WATCHED MYINFANT DAYS NO MOTHER HAD BLESSED ME WITH SMILES AND CARESSES OR IFTHEY HAD ALL MY PAST LIFE WAS NOW A BLOT A BLIND VACANCY IN WHICH IDISTINGUISHED NOTHING. FROM MY EARLIEST REMEMBRANCE I HAD BEEN AS ITHEN WAS IN HEIGHT AND PROPORTION. I HAD NEVER YET SEEN A BEINGRESEMBLING ME OR WHO CLAIMED ANY INTERCOURSE WITH ME. WHAT WAS I THEQUESTION AGAIN RECURRED TO BE ANSWERED ONLY WITH GROANS.I WILL SOON EXPLAIN TO WHAT THESE FEELINGS TENDED BUT ALLOW ME NOW TORETURN TO THE COTTAGERS WHOSE STORY EXCITED IN ME SUCH VARIOUSFEELINGS OF INDIGNATION DELIGHT AND WONDER BUT WHICH ALL TERMINATEDIN ADDITIONAL LOVE AND REVERENCE FOR MY PROTECTORS FOR SO I LOVED INAN INNOCENT HALFPAINFUL SELFDECEIT TO CALL THEM.CHAPTER SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE I LEARNED THE HISTORY OF MY FRIENDS. IT WASONE WHICH COULD NOT FAIL TO IMPRESS ITSELF DEEPLY ON MY MIND UNFOLDINGAS IT DID A NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES EACH INTERESTING AND WONDERFUL TOONE SO UTTERLY INEXPERIENCED AS I WAS.THE NAME OF THE OLD MAN WAS DE LACEY. HE WAS DESCENDED FROM A GOODFAMILY IN FRANCE WHERE HE HAD LIVED FOR MANY YEARS IN AFFLUENCERESPECTED BY HIS SUPERIORS AND BELOVED BY HIS EQUALS. HIS SON WAS BREDIN THE SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY AND AGATHA HAD RANKED WITH LADIES OF THEHIGHEST DISTINCTION. A FEW MONTHS BEFORE MY ARRIVAL THEY HAD LIVED INA LARGE AND LUXURIOUS CITY CALLED PARIS SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS ANDPOSSESSED OF EVERY ENJOYMENT WHICH VIRTUE REFINEMENT OF INTELLECT ORTASTE ACCOMPANIED BY A MODERATE FORTUNE COULD AFFORD.THE FATHER OF SAFIE HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF THEIR RUIN. HE WAS ATURKISH MERCHANT AND HAD INHABITED PARIS FOR MANY YEARS WHEN FOR SOMEREASON WHICH I COULD NOT LEARN HE BECAME OBNOXIOUS TO THE GOVERNMENT.HE WAS SEIZED AND CAST INTO PRISON THE VERY DAY THAT SAFIE ARRIVED FROMCONSTANTINOPLE TO JOIN HIM. HE WAS TRIED AND CONDEMNED TO DEATH. THEINJUSTICE OF HIS SENTENCE WAS VERY FLAGRANT ALL PARIS WAS INDIGNANTAND IT WAS JUDGED THAT HIS RELIGION AND WEALTH RATHER THAN THE CRIMEALLEGED AGAINST HIM HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF HIS CONDEMNATION.FELIX HAD ACCIDENTALLY BEEN PRESENT AT THE TRIAL HIS HORROR ANDINDIGNATION WERE UNCONTROLLABLE WHEN HE HEARD THE DECISION OF THECOURT. HE MADE AT THAT MOMENT A SOLEMN VOW TO DELIVER HIM AND THENLOOKED AROUND FOR THE MEANS. AFTER MANY FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS TO GAINADMITTANCE TO THE PRISON HE FOUND A STRONGLY GRATED WINDOW IN ANUNGUARDED PART OF THE BUILDING WHICH LIGHTED THE DUNGEON OF THEUNFORTUNATE MUHAMMADAN WHO LOADED WITH CHAINS WAITED IN DESPAIR THEEXECUTION OF THE BARBAROUS SENTENCE. FELIX VISITED THE GRATE AT NIGHTAND MADE KNOWN TO THE PRISONER HIS INTENTIONS IN HIS FAVOUR. THE TURKAMAZED AND DELIGHTED ENDEAVOURED TO KINDLE THE ZEAL OF HIS DELIVERERBY PROMISES OF REWARD AND WEALTH. FELIX REJECTED HIS OFFERS WITHCONTEMPT YET WHEN HE SAW THE LOVELY SAFIE WHO WAS ALLOWED TO VISITHER FATHER AND WHO BY HER GESTURES EXPRESSED HER LIVELY GRATITUDE THEYOUTH COULD NOT HELP OWNING TO HIS OWN MIND THAT THE CAPTIVE POSSESSEDA TREASURE WHICH WOULD FULLY REWARD HIS TOIL AND HAZARD.THE TURK QUICKLY PERCEIVED THE IMPRESSION THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAD MADEON THE HEART OF FELIX AND ENDEAVOURED TO SECURE HIM MORE ENTIRELY INHIS INTERESTS BY THE PROMISE OF HER HAND IN MARRIAGE SO SOON AS HESHOULD BE CONVEYED TO A PLACE OF SAFETY. FELIX WAS TOO DELICATE TOACCEPT THIS OFFER YET HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE PROBABILITY OF THEEVENT AS TO THE CONSUMMATION OF HIS HAPPINESS.DURING THE ENSUING DAYS WHILE THE PREPARATIONS WERE GOING FORWARD FORTHE ESCAPE OF THE MERCHANT THE ZEAL OF FELIX WAS WARMED BY SEVERALLETTERS THAT HE RECEIVED FROM THIS LOVELY GIRL WHO FOUND MEANS TOEXPRESS HER THOUGHTS IN THE LANGUAGE OF HER LOVER BY THE AID OF AN OLDMAN A SERVANT OF HER FATHER WHO UNDERSTOOD FRENCH. SHE THANKED HIM INTHE MOST ARDENT TERMS FOR HIS INTENDED SERVICES TOWARDS HER PARENT ANDAT THE SAME TIME SHE GENTLY DEPLORED HER OWN FATE.I HAVE COPIES OF THESE LETTERS FOR I FOUND MEANS DURING MY RESIDENCEIN THE HOVEL TO PROCURE THE IMPLEMENTS OF WRITING AND THE LETTERSWERE OFTEN IN THE HANDS OF FELIX OR AGATHA. BEFORE I DEPART I WILLGIVE THEM TO YOU THEY WILL PROVE THE TRUTH OF MY TALE BUT AT PRESENTAS THE SUN IS ALREADY FAR DECLINED I SHALL ONLY HAVE TIME TO REPEATTHE SUBSTANCE OF THEM TO YOU.SAFIE RELATED THAT HER MOTHER WAS A CHRISTIAN ARAB SEIZED AND MADE ASLAVE BY THE TURKS RECOMMENDED BY HER BEAUTY SHE HAD WON THE HEART OFTHE FATHER OF SAFIE WHO MARRIED HER. THE YOUNG GIRL SPOKE IN HIGH ANDENTHUSIASTIC TERMS OF HER MOTHER WHO BORN IN FREEDOM SPURNED THEBONDAGE TO WHICH SHE WAS NOW REDUCED. SHE INSTRUCTED HER DAUGHTER INTHE TENETS OF HER RELIGION AND TAUGHT HER TO ASPIRE TO HIGHER POWERS OFINTELLECT AND AN INDEPENDENCE OF SPIRIT FORBIDDEN TO THE FEMALEFOLLOWERS OF MUHAMMAD. THIS LADY DIED BUT HER LESSONS WERE INDELIBLYIMPRESSED ON THE MIND OF SAFIE WHO SICKENED AT THE PROSPECT OF AGAINRETURNING TO ASIA AND BEING IMMURED WITHIN THE WALLS OF A HAREMALLOWED ONLY TO OCCUPY HERSELF WITH INFANTILE AMUSEMENTS ILLSUITED TOTHE TEMPER OF HER SOUL NOW ACCUSTOMED TO GRAND IDEAS AND A NOBLEEMULATION FOR VIRTUE. THE PROSPECT OF MARRYING A CHRISTIAN ANDREMAINING IN A COUNTRY WHERE WOMEN WERE ALLOWED TO TAKE A RANK INSOCIETY WAS ENCHANTING TO HER.THE DAY FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE TURK WAS FIXED BUT ON THE NIGHTPREVIOUS TO IT HE QUITTED HIS PRISON AND BEFORE MORNING WAS DISTANTMANY LEAGUES FROM PARIS. FELIX HAD PROCURED PASSPORTS IN THE NAME OFHIS FATHER SISTER AND HIMSELF. HE HAD PREVIOUSLY COMMUNICATED HISPLAN TO THE FORMER WHO AIDED THE DECEIT BY QUITTING HIS HOUSE UNDERTHE PRETENCE OF A JOURNEY AND CONCEALED HIMSELF WITH HIS DAUGHTER INAN OBSCURE PART OF PARIS.FELIX CONDUCTED THE FUGITIVES THROUGH FRANCE TO LYONS AND ACROSS MONTCENIS TO LEGHORN WHERE THE MERCHANT HAD DECIDED TO WAIT A FAVOURABLEOPPORTUNITY OF PASSING INTO SOME PART OF THE TURKISH DOMINIONS.SAFIE RESOLVED TO REMAIN WITH HER FATHER UNTIL THE MOMENT OF HISDEPARTURE BEFORE WHICH TIME THE TURK RENEWED HIS PROMISE THAT SHESHOULD BE UNITED TO HIS DELIVERER AND FELIX REMAINED WITH THEM INEXPECTATION OF THAT EVENT AND IN THE MEANTIME HE ENJOYED THE SOCIETYOF THE ARABIAN WHO EXHIBITED TOWARDS HIM THE SIMPLEST AND TENDERESTAFFECTION. THEY CONVERSED WITH ONE ANOTHER THROUGH THE MEANS OF ANINTERPRETER AND SOMETIMES WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF LOOKS AND SAFIESANG TO HIM THE DIVINE AIRS OF HER NATIVE COUNTRY.THE TURK ALLOWED THIS INTIMACY TO TAKE PLACE AND ENCOURAGED THE HOPESOF THE YOUTHFUL LOVERS WHILE IN HIS HEART HE HAD FORMED FAR OTHERPLANS. HE LOATHED THE IDEA THAT HIS DAUGHTER SHOULD BE UNITED TO ACHRISTIAN BUT HE FEARED THE RESENTMENT OF FELIX IF HE SHOULD APPEARLUKEWARM FOR HE KNEW THAT HE WAS STILL IN THE POWER OF HIS DELIVERERIF HE SHOULD CHOOSE TO BETRAY HIM TO THE ITALIAN STATE WHICH THEYINHABITED. HE REVOLVED A THOUSAND PLANS BY WHICH HE SHOULD BE ENABLEDTO PROLONG THE DECEIT UNTIL IT MIGHT BE NO LONGER NECESSARY ANDSECRETLY TO TAKE HIS DAUGHTER WITH HIM WHEN HE DEPARTED. HIS PLANSWERE FACILITATED BY THE NEWS WHICH ARRIVED FROM PARIS.THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE WERE GREATLY ENRAGED AT THE ESCAPE OF THEIRVICTIM AND SPARED NO PAINS TO DETECT AND PUNISH HIS DELIVERER. THEPLOT OF FELIX WAS QUICKLY DISCOVERED AND DE LACEY AND AGATHA WERETHROWN INTO PRISON. THE NEWS REACHED FELIX AND ROUSED HIM FROM HISDREAM OF PLEASURE. HIS BLIND AND AGED FATHER AND HIS GENTLE SISTER LAYIN A NOISOME DUNGEON WHILE HE ENJOYED THE FREE AIR AND THE SOCIETY OFHER WHOM HE LOVED. THIS IDEA WAS TORTURE TO HIM. HE QUICKLY ARRANGEDWITH THE TURK THAT IF THE LATTER SHOULD FIND A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITYFOR ESCAPE BEFORE FELIX COULD RETURN TO ITALY SAFIE SHOULD REMAIN AS ABOARDER AT A CONVENT AT LEGHORN AND THEN QUITTING THE LOVELY ARABIANHE HASTENED TO PARIS AND DELIVERED HIMSELF UP TO THE VENGEANCE OF THELAW HOPING TO FREE DE LACEY AND AGATHA BY THIS PROCEEDING.HE DID NOT SUCCEED. THEY REMAINED CONFINED FOR FIVE MONTHS BEFORE THETRIAL TOOK PLACE THE RESULT OF WHICH DEPRIVED THEM OF THEIR FORTUNEAND CONDEMNED THEM TO A PERPETUAL EXILE FROM THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY.THEY FOUND A MISERABLE ASYLUM IN THE COTTAGE IN GERMANY WHERE IDISCOVERED THEM. FELIX SOON LEARNED THAT THE TREACHEROUS TURK FORWHOM HE AND HIS FAMILY ENDURED SUCH UNHEARDOF OPPRESSION ONDISCOVERING THAT HIS DELIVERER WAS THUS REDUCED TO POVERTY AND RUINBECAME A TRAITOR TO GOOD FEELING AND HONOUR AND HAD QUITTED ITALY WITHHIS DAUGHTER INSULTINGLY SENDING FELIX A PITTANCE OF MONEY TO AID HIMAS HE SAID IN SOME PLAN OF FUTURE MAINTENANCE.SUCH WERE THE EVENTS THAT PREYED ON THE HEART OF FELIX AND RENDEREDHIM WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM THE MOST MISERABLE OF HIS FAMILY. HE COULDHAVE ENDURED POVERTY AND WHILE THIS DISTRESS HAD BEEN THE MEED OF HISVIRTUE HE GLORIED IN IT BUT THE INGRATITUDE OF THE TURK AND THE LOSSOF HIS BELOVED SAFIE WERE MISFORTUNES MORE BITTER AND IRREPARABLE. THEARRIVAL OF THE ARABIAN NOW INFUSED NEW LIFE INTO HIS SOUL.WHEN THE NEWS REACHED LEGHORN THAT FELIX WAS DEPRIVED OF HIS WEALTHAND RANK THE MERCHANT COMMANDED HIS DAUGHTER TO THINK NO MORE OF HERLOVER BUT TO PREPARE TO RETURN TO HER NATIVE COUNTRY. THE GENEROUSNATURE OF SAFIE WAS OUTRAGED BY THIS COMMAND SHE ATTEMPTED TOEXPOSTULATE WITH HER FATHER BUT HE LEFT HER ANGRILY REITERATING HISTYRANNICAL MANDATE.A FEW DAYS AFTER THE TURK ENTERED HIS DAUGHTERS APARTMENT AND TOLDHER HASTILY THAT HE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HIS RESIDENCE AT LEGHORNHAD BEEN DIVULGED AND THAT HE SHOULD SPEEDILY BE DELIVERED UP TO THEFRENCH GOVERNMENT HE HAD CONSEQUENTLY HIRED A VESSEL TO CONVEY HIM TOCONSTANTINOPLE FOR WHICH CITY HE SHOULD SAIL IN A FEW HOURS. HEINTENDED TO LEAVE HIS DAUGHTER UNDER THE CARE OF A CONFIDENTIALSERVANT TO FOLLOW AT HER LEISURE WITH THE GREATER PART OF HISPROPERTY WHICH HAD NOT YET ARRIVED AT LEGHORN.WHEN ALONE SAFIE RESOLVED IN HER OWN MIND THE PLAN OF CONDUCT THAT ITWOULD BECOME HER TO PURSUE IN THIS EMERGENCY. A RESIDENCE IN TURKEYWAS ABHORRENT TO HER HER RELIGION AND HER FEELINGS WERE ALIKE AVERSETO IT. BY SOME PAPERS OF HER FATHER WHICH FELL INTO HER HANDS SHEHEARD OF THE EXILE OF HER LOVER AND LEARNT THE NAME OF THE SPOT WHEREHE THEN RESIDED. SHE HESITATED SOME TIME BUT AT LENGTH SHE FORMED HERDETERMINATION. TAKING WITH HER SOME JEWELS THAT BELONGED TO HER AND ASUM OF MONEY SHE QUITTED ITALY WITH AN ATTENDANT A NATIVE OF LEGHORNBUT WHO UNDERSTOOD THE COMMON LANGUAGE OF TURKEY AND DEPARTED FORGERMANY.SHE ARRIVED IN SAFETY AT A TOWN ABOUT TWENTY LEAGUES FROM THE COTTAGEOF DE LACEY WHEN HER ATTENDANT FELL DANGEROUSLY ILL. SAFIE NURSED HERWITH THE MOST DEVOTED AFFECTION BUT THE POOR GIRL DIED AND THEARABIAN WAS LEFT ALONE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRYAND UTTERLY IGNORANT OF THE CUSTOMS OF THE WORLD. SHE FELL HOWEVERINTO GOOD HANDS. THE ITALIAN HAD MENTIONED THE NAME OF THE SPOT FORWHICH THEY WERE BOUND AND AFTER HER DEATH THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE INWHICH THEY HAD LIVED TOOK CARE THAT SAFIE SHOULD ARRIVE IN SAFETY ATTHE COTTAGE OF HER LOVER.CHAPTER SUCH WAS THE HISTORY OF MY BELOVED COTTAGERS. IT IMPRESSED ME DEEPLY.I LEARNED FROM THE VIEWS OF SOCIAL LIFE WHICH IT DEVELOPED TO ADMIRETHEIR VIRTUES AND TO DEPRECATE THE VICES OF MANKIND.AS YET I LOOKED UPON CRIME AS A DISTANT EVIL BENEVOLENCE ANDGENEROSITY WERE EVER PRESENT BEFORE ME INCITING WITHIN ME A DESIRE TOBECOME AN ACTOR IN THE BUSY SCENE WHERE SO MANY ADMIRABLE QUALITIESWERE CALLED FORTH AND DISPLAYED. BUT IN GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF THEPROGRESS OF MY INTELLECT I MUST NOT OMIT A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH OCCURREDIN THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH OF AUGUST OF THE SAME YEAR.ONE NIGHT DURING MY ACCUSTOMED VISIT TO THE NEIGHBOURING WOOD WHERE ICOLLECTED MY OWN FOOD AND BROUGHT HOME FIRING FOR MY PROTECTORS I FOUND ONTHE GROUND A LEATHERN PORTMANTEAU CONTAINING SEVERAL ARTICLES OF DRESS ANDSOME BOOKS. I EAGERLY SEIZED THE PRIZE AND RETURNED WITH IT TO MY HOVEL. FORTUNATELY THE BOOKS WERE WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE THE ELEMENTS OF WHICH IHAD ACQUIRED AT THE COTTAGE THEY CONSISTED OF PARADISE LOST A VOLUMEOF PLUTARCHS LIVES AND THE SORROWS OF WERTER. THEPOSSESSION OF THESE TREASURES GAVE ME EXTREME DELIGHT I NOW CONTINUALLYSTUDIED AND EXERCISED MY MIND UPON THESE HISTORIES WHILST MY FRIENDS WEREEMPLOYED IN THEIR ORDINARY OCCUPATIONS.I CAN HARDLY DESCRIBE TO YOU THE EFFECT OF THESE BOOKS. THEY PRODUCEDIN ME AN INFINITY OF NEW IMAGES AND FEELINGS THAT SOMETIMES RAISED METO ECSTASY BUT MORE FREQUENTLY SUNK ME INTO THE LOWEST DEJECTION. INTHE SORROWS OF WERTER BESIDES THE INTEREST OF ITS SIMPLE AND AFFECTINGSTORY SO MANY OPINIONS ARE CANVASSED AND SO MANY LIGHTS THROWN UPONWHAT HAD HITHERTO BEEN TO ME OBSCURE SUBJECTS THAT I FOUND IN IT ANEVERENDING SOURCE OF SPECULATION AND ASTONISHMENT. THE GENTLE ANDDOMESTIC MANNERS IT DESCRIBED COMBINED WITH LOFTY SENTIMENTS ANDFEELINGS WHICH HAD FOR THEIR OBJECT SOMETHING OUT OF SELF ACCORDEDWELL WITH MY EXPERIENCE AMONG MY PROTECTORS AND WITH THE WANTS WHICHWERE FOR EVER ALIVE IN MY OWN BOSOM. BUT I THOUGHT WERTER HIMSELF AMORE DIVINE BEING THAN I HAD EVER BEHELD OR IMAGINED HIS CHARACTERCONTAINED NO PRETENSION BUT IT SANK DEEP. THE DISQUISITIONS UPONDEATH AND SUICIDE WERE CALCULATED TO FILL ME WITH WONDER. I DID NOTPRETEND TO ENTER INTO THE MERITS OF THE CASE YET I INCLINED TOWARDSTHE OPINIONS OF THE HERO WHOSE EXTINCTION I WEPT WITHOUT PRECISELYUNDERSTANDING IT.AS I READ HOWEVER I APPLIED MUCH PERSONALLY TO MY OWN FEELINGS ANDCONDITION. I FOUND MYSELF SIMILAR YET AT THE SAME TIME STRANGELYUNLIKE TO THE BEINGS CONCERNING WHOM I READ AND TO WHOSE CONVERSATION IWAS A LISTENER. I SYMPATHISED WITH AND PARTLY UNDERSTOOD THEM BUT IWAS UNFORMED IN MIND I WAS DEPENDENT ON NONE AND RELATED TO NONE.THE PATH OF MY DEPARTURE WAS FREE AND THERE WAS NONE TO LAMENT MYANNIHILATION. MY PERSON WAS HIDEOUS AND MY STATURE GIGANTIC. WHAT DIDTHIS MEAN WHO WAS I WHAT WAS I WHENCE DID I COME WHAT WAS MYDESTINATION THESE QUESTIONS CONTINUALLY RECURRED BUT I WAS UNABLE TOSOLVE THEM.THE VOLUME OF PLUTARCHS LIVES WHICH I POSSESSED CONTAINED THEHISTORIES OF THE FIRST FOUNDERS OF THE ANCIENT REPUBLICS. THIS BOOKHAD A FAR DIFFERENT EFFECT UPON ME FROM THE SORROWS OF WERTER. ILEARNED FROM WERTERS IMAGINATIONS DESPONDENCY AND GLOOM BUT PLUTARCHTAUGHT ME HIGH THOUGHTS HE ELEVATED ME ABOVE THE WRETCHED SPHERE OF MYOWN REFLECTIONS TO ADMIRE AND LOVE THE HEROES OF PAST AGES. MANYTHINGS I READ SURPASSED MY UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERIENCE. I HAD A VERYCONFUSED KNOWLEDGE OF KINGDOMS WIDE EXTENTS OF COUNTRY MIGHTY RIVERSAND BOUNDLESS SEAS. BUT I WAS PERFECTLY UNACQUAINTED WITH TOWNS ANDLARGE ASSEMBLAGES OF MEN. THE COTTAGE OF MY PROTECTORS HAD BEEN THEONLY SCHOOL IN WHICH I HAD STUDIED HUMAN NATURE BUT THIS BOOKDEVELOPED NEW AND MIGHTIER SCENES OF ACTION. I READ OF MEN CONCERNEDIN PUBLIC AFFAIRS GOVERNING OR MASSACRING THEIR SPECIES. I FELT THEGREATEST ARDOUR FOR VIRTUE RISE WITHIN ME AND ABHORRENCE FOR VICE ASFAR AS I UNDERSTOOD THE SIGNIFICATION OF THOSE TERMS RELATIVE AS THEYWERE AS I APPLIED THEM TO PLEASURE AND PAIN ALONE. INDUCED BY THESEFEELINGS I WAS OF COURSE LED TO ADMIRE PEACEABLE LAWGIVERS NUMASOLON AND LYCURGUS IN PREFERENCE TO ROMULUS AND THESEUS. THEPATRIARCHAL LIVES OF MY PROTECTORS CAUSED THESE IMPRESSIONS TO TAKE AFIRM HOLD ON MY MIND PERHAPS IF MY FIRST INTRODUCTION TO HUMANITY HADBEEN MADE BY A YOUNG SOLDIER BURNING FOR GLORY AND SLAUGHTER I SHOULDHAVE BEEN IMBUED WITH DIFFERENT SENSATIONS.BUT PARADISE LOST EXCITED DIFFERENT AND FAR DEEPER EMOTIONS. I READIT AS I HAD READ THE OTHER VOLUMES WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO MY HANDS ASA TRUE HISTORY. IT MOVED EVERY FEELING OF WONDER AND AWE THAT THEPICTURE OF AN OMNIPOTENT GOD WARRING WITH HIS CREATURES WAS CAPABLE OFEXCITING. I OFTEN REFERRED THE SEVERAL SITUATIONS AS THEIR SIMILARITYSTRUCK ME TO MY OWN. LIKE ADAM I WAS APPARENTLY UNITED BY NO LINK TOANY OTHER BEING IN EXISTENCE BUT HIS STATE WAS FAR DIFFERENT FROM MINEIN EVERY OTHER RESPECT. HE HAD COME FORTH FROM THE HANDS OF GOD APERFECT CREATURE HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS GUARDED BY THE ESPECIAL CARE OFHIS CREATOR HE WAS ALLOWED TO CONVERSE WITH AND ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE FROMBEINGS OF A SUPERIOR NATURE BUT I WAS WRETCHED HELPLESS AND ALONE.MANY TIMES I CONSIDERED SATAN AS THE FITTER EMBLEM OF MY CONDITION FOROFTEN LIKE HIM WHEN I VIEWED THE BLISS OF MY PROTECTORS THE BITTERGALL OF ENVY ROSE WITHIN ME.ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE STRENGTHENED AND CONFIRMED THESE FEELINGS. SOONAFTER MY ARRIVAL IN THE HOVEL I DISCOVERED SOME PAPERS IN THE POCKET OFTHE DRESS WHICH I HAD TAKEN FROM YOUR LABORATORY. AT FIRST I HADNEGLECTED THEM BUT NOW THAT I WAS ABLE TO DECIPHER THE CHARACTERS INWHICH THEY WERE WRITTEN I BEGAN TO STUDY THEM WITH DILIGENCE. IT WASYOUR JOURNAL OF THE FOUR MONTHS THAT PRECEDED MY CREATION. YOUMINUTELY DESCRIBED IN THESE PAPERS EVERY STEP YOU TOOK IN THE PROGRESSOF YOUR WORK THIS HISTORY WAS MINGLED WITH ACCOUNTS OF DOMESTICOCCURRENCES. YOU DOUBTLESS RECOLLECT THESE PAPERS. HERE THEY ARE.EVERYTHING IS RELATED IN THEM WHICH BEARS REFERENCE TO MY ACCURSEDORIGIN THE WHOLE DETAIL OF THAT SERIES OF DISGUSTING CIRCUMSTANCESWHICH PRODUCED IT IS SET IN VIEW THE MINUTEST DESCRIPTION OF MY ODIOUSAND LOATHSOME PERSON IS GIVEN IN LANGUAGE WHICH PAINTED YOUR OWNHORRORS AND RENDERED MINE INDELIBLE. I SICKENED AS I READ. HATEFULDAY WHEN I RECEIVED LIFE I EXCLAIMED IN AGONY. ACCURSED CREATORWHY DID YOU FORM A MONSTER SO HIDEOUS THAT EVEN YOU TURNED FROM ME INDISGUST GOD IN PITY MADE MAN BEAUTIFUL AND ALLURING AFTER HIS OWNIMAGE BUT MY FORM IS A FILTHY TYPE OF YOURS MORE HORRID EVEN FROM THEVERY RESEMBLANCE. SATAN HAD HIS COMPANIONS FELLOW DEVILS TO ADMIREAND ENCOURAGE HIM BUT I AM SOLITARY AND ABHORRED.THESE WERE THE REFLECTIONS OF MY HOURS OF DESPONDENCY AND SOLITUDEBUT WHEN I CONTEMPLATED THE VIRTUES OF THE COTTAGERS THEIR AMIABLE ANDBENEVOLENT DISPOSITIONS I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT WHEN THEY SHOULDBECOME ACQUAINTED WITH MY ADMIRATION OF THEIR VIRTUES THEY WOULDCOMPASSIONATE ME AND OVERLOOK MY PERSONAL DEFORMITY. COULD THEY TURNFROM THEIR DOOR ONE HOWEVER MONSTROUS WHO SOLICITED THEIR COMPASSIONAND FRIENDSHIP I RESOLVED AT LEAST NOT TO DESPAIR BUT IN EVERY WAYTO FIT MYSELF FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH THEM WHICH WOULD DECIDE MY FATE. IPOSTPONED THIS ATTEMPT FOR SOME MONTHS LONGER FOR THE IMPORTANCEATTACHED TO ITS SUCCESS INSPIRED ME WITH A DREAD LEST I SHOULD FAIL.BESIDES I FOUND THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IMPROVED SO MUCH WITH EVERYDAYS EXPERIENCE THAT I WAS UNWILLING TO COMMENCE THIS UNDERTAKINGUNTIL A FEW MORE MONTHS SHOULD HAVE ADDED TO MY SAGACITY.SEVERAL CHANGES IN THE MEANTIME TOOK PLACE IN THE COTTAGE. THEPRESENCE OF SAFIE DIFFUSED HAPPINESS AMONG ITS INHABITANTS AND I ALSOFOUND THAT A GREATER DEGREE OF PLENTY REIGNED THERE. FELIX AND AGATHASPENT MORE TIME IN AMUSEMENT AND CONVERSATION AND WERE ASSISTED INTHEIR LABOURS BY SERVANTS. THEY DID NOT APPEAR RICH BUT THEY WERECONTENTED AND HAPPY THEIR FEELINGS WERE SERENE AND PEACEFUL WHILEMINE BECAME EVERY DAY MORE TUMULTUOUS. INCREASE OF KNOWLEDGE ONLYDISCOVERED TO ME MORE CLEARLY WHAT A WRETCHED OUTCAST I WAS. ICHERISHED HOPE IT IS TRUE BUT IT VANISHED WHEN I BEHELD MY PERSONREFLECTED IN WATER OR MY SHADOW IN THE MOONSHINE EVEN AS THAT FRAILIMAGE AND THAT INCONSTANT SHADE.I ENDEAVOURED TO CRUSH THESE FEARS AND TO FORTIFY MYSELF FOR THE TRIALWHICH IN A FEW MONTHS I RESOLVED TO UNDERGO AND SOMETIMES I ALLOWED MYTHOUGHTS UNCHECKED BY REASON TO RAMBLE IN THE FIELDS OF PARADISE ANDDARED TO FANCY AMIABLE AND LOVELY CREATURES SYMPATHISING WITH MYFEELINGS AND CHEERING MY GLOOM THEIR ANGELIC COUNTENANCES BREATHEDSMILES OF CONSOLATION. BUT IT WAS ALL A DREAM NO EVE SOOTHED MYSORROWS NOR SHARED MY THOUGHTS I WAS ALONE. I REMEMBERED ADAMSSUPPLICATION TO HIS CREATOR. BUT WHERE WAS MINE HE HAD ABANDONED MEAND IN THE BITTERNESS OF MY HEART I CURSED HIM.AUTUMN PASSED THUS. I SAW WITH SURPRISE AND GRIEF THE LEAVES DECAYAND FALL AND NATURE AGAIN ASSUME THE BARREN AND BLEAK APPEARANCE ITHAD WORN WHEN I FIRST BEHELD THE WOODS AND THE LOVELY MOON. YET I DIDNOT HEED THE BLEAKNESS OF THE WEATHER I WAS BETTER FITTED BY MYCONFORMATION FOR THE ENDURANCE OF COLD THAN HEAT. BUT MY CHIEFDELIGHTS WERE THE SIGHT OF THE FLOWERS THE BIRDS AND ALL THE GAYAPPAREL OF SUMMER WHEN THOSE DESERTED ME I TURNED WITH MORE ATTENTIONTOWARDS THE COTTAGERS. THEIR HAPPINESS WAS NOT DECREASED BY THEABSENCE OF SUMMER. THEY LOVED AND SYMPATHISED WITH ONE ANOTHER ANDTHEIR JOYS DEPENDING ON EACH OTHER WERE NOT INTERRUPTED BY THECASUALTIES THAT TOOK PLACE AROUND THEM. THE MORE I SAW OF THEM THEGREATER BECAME MY DESIRE TO CLAIM THEIR PROTECTION AND KINDNESS MYHEART YEARNED TO BE KNOWN AND LOVED BY THESE AMIABLE CREATURES TO SEETHEIR SWEET LOOKS DIRECTED TOWARDS ME WITH AFFECTION WAS THE UTMOSTLIMIT OF MY AMBITION. I DARED NOT THINK THAT THEY WOULD TURN THEM FROMME WITH DISDAIN AND HORROR. THE POOR THAT STOPPED AT THEIR DOOR WERENEVER DRIVEN AWAY. I ASKED IT IS TRUE FOR GREATER TREASURES THAN ALITTLE FOOD OR REST I REQUIRED KINDNESS AND SYMPATHY BUT I DID NOTBELIEVE MYSELF UTTERLY UNWORTHY OF IT.THE WINTER ADVANCED AND AN ENTIRE REVOLUTION OF THE SEASONS HAD TAKENPLACE SINCE I AWOKE INTO LIFE. MY ATTENTION AT THIS TIME WAS SOLELYDIRECTED TOWARDS MY PLAN OF INTRODUCING MYSELF INTO THE COTTAGE OF MYPROTECTORS. I REVOLVED MANY PROJECTS BUT THAT ON WHICH I FINALLYFIXED WAS TO ENTER THE DWELLING WHEN THE BLIND OLD MAN SHOULD BE ALONE.I HAD SAGACITY ENOUGH TO DISCOVER THAT THE UNNATURAL HIDEOUSNESS OF MYPERSON WAS THE CHIEF OBJECT OF HORROR WITH THOSE WHO HAD FORMERLYBEHELD ME. MY VOICE ALTHOUGH HARSH HAD NOTHING TERRIBLE IN IT ITHOUGHT THEREFORE THAT IF IN THE ABSENCE OF HIS CHILDREN I COULD GAINTHE GOOD WILL AND MEDIATION OF THE OLD DE LACEY I MIGHT BY HIS MEANSBE TOLERATED BY MY YOUNGER PROTECTORS.ONE DAY WHEN THE SUN SHONE ON THE RED LEAVES THAT STREWED THE GROUNDAND DIFFUSED CHEERFULNESS ALTHOUGH IT DENIED WARMTH SAFIE AGATHAAND FELIX DEPARTED ON A LONG COUNTRY WALK AND THE OLD MAN AT HIS OWNDESIRE WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE COTTAGE. WHEN HIS CHILDREN HAD DEPARTEDHE TOOK UP HIS GUITAR AND PLAYED SEVERAL MOURNFUL BUT SWEET AIRS MORESWEET AND MOURNFUL THAN I HAD EVER HEARD HIM PLAY BEFORE. AT FIRST HISCOUNTENANCE WAS ILLUMINATED WITH PLEASURE BUT AS HE CONTINUEDTHOUGHTFULNESS AND SADNESS SUCCEEDED AT LENGTH LAYING ASIDE THEINSTRUMENT HE SAT ABSORBED IN REFLECTION.MY HEART BEAT QUICK THIS WAS THE HOUR AND MOMENT OF TRIAL WHICHWOULD DECIDE MY HOPES OR REALISE MY FEARS. THE SERVANTS WERE GONE TO ANEIGHBOURING FAIR. ALL WAS SILENT IN AND AROUND THE COTTAGE IT WAS ANEXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY YET WHEN I PROCEEDED TO EXECUTE MY PLAN MYLIMBS FAILED ME AND I SANK TO THE GROUND. AGAIN I ROSE AND EXERTINGALL THE FIRMNESS OF WHICH I WAS MASTER REMOVED THE PLANKS WHICH I HADPLACED BEFORE MY HOVEL TO CONCEAL MY RETREAT. THE FRESH AIR REVIVEDME AND WITH RENEWED DETERMINATION I APPROACHED THE DOOR OF THEIRCOTTAGE.I KNOCKED. WHO IS THERE SAID THE OLD MAN. COME IN.I ENTERED. PARDON THIS INTRUSION SAID I I AMA TRAVELLER IN WANT OF A LITTLE REST YOU WOULD GREATLY OBLIGE ME IF YOUWOULD ALLOW ME TO REMAIN A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE FIRE.ENTER SAID DE LACEY AND I WILL TRY IN WHATMANNER I CAN TO RELIEVE YOUR WANTS BUT UNFORTUNATELY MY CHILDREN AREFROM HOME AND AS I AM BLIND I AM AFRAID I SHALL FIND IT DIFFICULT TOPROCURE FOOD FOR YOU.DO NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF MY KIND HOST I HAVE FOOD IT ISWARMTH AND REST ONLY THAT I NEED.I SAT DOWN AND A SILENCE ENSUED. I KNEW THAT EVERY MINUTE WASPRECIOUS TO ME YET I REMAINED IRRESOLUTE IN WHAT MANNER TO COMMENCETHE INTERVIEW WHEN THE OLD MAN ADDRESSED ME.BY YOUR LANGUAGE STRANGER I SUPPOSE YOU ARE MY COUNTRYMAN ARE YOUFRENCHNO BUT I WAS EDUCATED BY A FRENCH FAMILY AND UNDERSTAND THATLANGUAGE ONLY. I AM NOW GOING TO CLAIM THE PROTECTION OF SOME FRIENDSWHOM I SINCERELY LOVE AND OF WHOSE FAVOUR I HAVE SOME HOPES.ARE THEY GERMANSNO THEY ARE FRENCH. BUT LET US CHANGE THE SUBJECT. I AM ANUNFORTUNATE AND DESERTED CREATURE I LOOK AROUND AND I HAVE NO RELATIONOR FRIEND UPON EARTH. THESE AMIABLE PEOPLE TO WHOM I GO HAVE NEVERSEEN ME AND KNOW LITTLE OF ME. I AM FULL OF FEARS FOR IF I FAILTHERE I AM AN OUTCAST IN THE WORLD FOR EVER.DO NOT DESPAIR. TO BE FRIENDLESS IS INDEED TO BE UNFORTUNATE BUTTHE HEARTS OF MEN WHEN UNPREJUDICED BY ANY OBVIOUS SELFINTEREST AREFULL OF BROTHERLY LOVE AND CHARITY. RELY THEREFORE ON YOUR HOPESAND IF THESE FRIENDS ARE GOOD AND AMIABLE DO NOT DESPAIR.THEY ARE KINDTHEY ARE THE MOST EXCELLENT CREATURES IN THE WORLDBUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE PREJUDICED AGAINST ME. I HAVE GOODDISPOSITIONS MY LIFE HAS BEEN HITHERTO HARMLESS AND IN SOME DEGREEBENEFICIAL BUT A FATAL PREJUDICE CLOUDS THEIR EYES AND WHERE THEYOUGHT TO SEE A FEELING AND KIND FRIEND THEY BEHOLD ONLY A DETESTABLEMONSTER.THAT IS INDEED UNFORTUNATE BUT IF YOU ARE REALLY BLAMELESS CANNOTYOU UNDECEIVE THEMI AM ABOUT TO UNDERTAKE THAT TASK AND IT IS ON THAT ACCOUNT THAT IFEEL SO MANY OVERWHELMING TERRORS. I TENDERLY LOVE THESE FRIENDS IHAVE UNKNOWN TO THEM BEEN FOR MANY MONTHS IN THE HABITS OF DAILYKINDNESS TOWARDS THEM BUT THEY BELIEVE THAT I WISH TO INJURE THEM ANDIT IS THAT PREJUDICE WHICH I WISH TO OVERCOME.WHERE DO THESE FRIENDS RESIDENEAR THIS SPOT.THE OLD MAN PAUSED AND THEN CONTINUED IF YOU WILL UNRESERVEDLYCONFIDE TO ME THE PARTICULARS OF YOUR TALE I PERHAPS MAY BE OF USE INUNDECEIVING THEM. I AM BLIND AND CANNOT JUDGE OF YOUR COUNTENANCE BUTTHERE IS SOMETHING IN YOUR WORDS WHICH PERSUADES ME THAT YOU ARESINCERE. I AM POOR AND AN EXILE BUT IT WILL AFFORD ME TRUE PLEASURETO BE IN ANY WAY SERVICEABLE TO A HUMAN CREATURE.EXCELLENT MAN I THANK YOU AND ACCEPT YOUR GENEROUS OFFER. YOURAISE ME FROM THE DUST BY THIS KINDNESS AND I TRUST THAT BY YOUR AIDI SHALL NOT BE DRIVEN FROM THE SOCIETY AND SYMPATHY OF YOUR FELLOWCREATURES.HEAVEN FORBID EVEN IF YOU WERE REALLY CRIMINAL FOR THAT CAN ONLYDRIVE YOU TO DESPERATION AND NOT INSTIGATE YOU TO VIRTUE. I ALSO AMUNFORTUNATE I AND MY FAMILY HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED ALTHOUGH INNOCENTJUDGE THEREFORE IF I DO NOT FEEL FOR YOUR MISFORTUNES.HOW CAN I THANK YOU MY BEST AND ONLY BENEFACTOR FROM YOUR LIPSFIRST HAVE I HEARD THE VOICE OF KINDNESS DIRECTED TOWARDS ME I SHALLBE FOR EVER GRATEFUL AND YOUR PRESENT HUMANITY ASSURES ME OF SUCCESSWITH THOSE FRIENDS WHOM I AM ON THE POINT OF MEETING.MAY I KNOW THE NAMES AND RESIDENCE OF THOSE FRIENDSI PAUSED. THIS I THOUGHT WAS THE MOMENT OF DECISION WHICH WAS TOROB ME OF OR BESTOW HAPPINESS ON ME FOR EVER. I STRUGGLED VAINLY FORFIRMNESS SUFFICIENT TO ANSWER HIM BUT THE EFFORT DESTROYED ALL MYREMAINING STRENGTH I SANK ON THE CHAIR AND SOBBED ALOUD. AT THATMOMENT I HEARD THE STEPS OF MY YOUNGER PROTECTORS. I HAD NOT A MOMENTTO LOSE BUT SEIZING THE HAND OF THE OLD MAN I CRIED NOW IS THETIME SAVE AND PROTECT ME YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE THE FRIENDS WHOM ISEEK. DO NOT YOU DESERT ME IN THE HOUR OF TRIALGREAT GOD EXCLAIMED THE OLD MAN. WHO ARE YOUAT THAT INSTANT THE COTTAGE DOOR WAS OPENED AND FELIX SAFIE ANDAGATHA ENTERED. WHO CAN DESCRIBE THEIR HORROR AND CONSTERNATION ONBEHOLDING ME AGATHA FAINTED AND SAFIE UNABLE TO ATTEND TO HERFRIEND RUSHED OUT OF THE COTTAGE. FELIX DARTED FORWARD AND WITHSUPERNATURAL FORCE TORE ME FROM HIS FATHER TO WHOSE KNEES I CLUNG INA TRANSPORT OF FURY HE DASHED ME TO THE GROUND AND STRUCK ME VIOLENTLYWITH A STICK. I COULD HAVE TORN HIM LIMB FROM LIMB AS THE LION RENDSTHE ANTELOPE. BUT MY HEART SANK WITHIN ME AS WITH BITTER SICKNESS ANDI REFRAINED. I SAW HIM ON THE POINT OF REPEATING HIS BLOW WHENOVERCOME BY PAIN AND ANGUISH I QUITTED THE COTTAGE AND IN THE GENERALTUMULT ESCAPED UNPERCEIVED TO MY HOVEL.CHAPTER CURSED CURSED CREATOR WHY DID I LIVE WHY IN THAT INSTANT DID INOT EXTINGUISH THE SPARK OF EXISTENCE WHICH YOU HAD SO WANTONLYBESTOWED I KNOW NOT DESPAIR HAD NOT YET TAKEN POSSESSION OF ME MYFEELINGS WERE THOSE OF RAGE AND REVENGE. I COULD WITH PLEASURE HAVEDESTROYED THE COTTAGE AND ITS INHABITANTS AND HAVE GLUTTED MYSELF WITHTHEIR SHRIEKS AND MISERY.WHEN NIGHT CAME I QUITTED MY RETREAT AND WANDERED IN THE WOOD ANDNOW NO LONGER RESTRAINED BY THE FEAR OF DISCOVERY I GAVE VENT TO MYANGUISH IN FEARFUL HOWLINGS. I WAS LIKE A WILD BEAST THAT HAD BROKENTHE TOILS DESTROYING THE OBJECTS THAT OBSTRUCTED ME AND RANGINGTHROUGH THE WOOD WITH A STAGLIKE SWIFTNESS. OH WHAT A MISERABLENIGHT I PASSED THE COLD STARS SHONE IN MOCKERY AND THE BARE TREESWAVED THEIR BRANCHES ABOVE ME NOW AND THEN THE SWEET VOICE OF A BIRDBURST FORTH AMIDST THE UNIVERSAL STILLNESS. ALL SAVE I WERE AT RESTOR IN ENJOYMENT I LIKE THE ARCHFIEND BORE A HELL WITHIN ME ANDFINDING MYSELF UNSYMPATHISED WITH WISHED TO TEAR UP THE TREES SPREADHAVOC AND DESTRUCTION AROUND ME AND THEN TO HAVE SAT DOWN AND ENJOYEDTHE RUIN.BUT THIS WAS A LUXURY OF SENSATION THAT COULD NOT ENDURE I BECAMEFATIGUED WITH EXCESS OF BODILY EXERTION AND SANK ON THE DAMP GRASS INTHE SICK IMPOTENCE OF DESPAIR. THERE WAS NONE AMONG THE MYRIADS OF MENTHAT EXISTED WHO WOULD PITY OR ASSIST ME AND SHOULD I FEEL KINDNESSTOWARDS MY ENEMIES NO FROM THAT MOMENT I DECLARED EVERLASTING WARAGAINST THE SPECIES AND MORE THAN ALL AGAINST HIM WHO HAD FORMED MEAND SENT ME FORTH TO THIS INSUPPORTABLE MISERY.THE SUN ROSE I HEARD THE VOICES OF MEN AND KNEW THAT IT WASIMPOSSIBLE TO RETURN TO MY RETREAT DURING THAT DAY. ACCORDINGLY I HIDMYSELF IN SOME THICK UNDERWOOD DETERMINING TO DEVOTE THE ENSUING HOURSTO REFLECTION ON MY SITUATION.THE PLEASANT SUNSHINE AND THE PURE AIR OF DAY RESTORED ME TO SOMEDEGREE OF TRANQUILLITY AND WHEN I CONSIDERED WHAT HAD PASSED AT THECOTTAGE I COULD NOT HELP BELIEVING THAT I HAD BEEN TOO HASTY IN MYCONCLUSIONS. I HAD CERTAINLY ACTED IMPRUDENTLY. IT WAS APPARENT THATMY CONVERSATION HAD INTERESTED THE FATHER IN MY BEHALF AND I WAS AFOOL IN HAVING EXPOSED MY PERSON TO THE HORROR OF HIS CHILDREN. IOUGHT TO HAVE FAMILIARISED THE OLD DE LACEY TO ME AND BY DEGREES TOHAVE DISCOVERED MYSELF TO THE REST OF HIS FAMILY WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVEBEEN PREPARED FOR MY APPROACH. BUT I DID NOT BELIEVE MY ERRORS TO BEIRRETRIEVABLE AND AFTER MUCH CONSIDERATION I RESOLVED TO RETURN TO THECOTTAGE SEEK THE OLD MAN AND BY MY REPRESENTATIONS WIN HIM TO MYPARTY.THESE THOUGHTS CALMED ME AND IN THE AFTERNOON I SANK INTO A PROFOUNDSLEEP BUT THE FEVER OF MY BLOOD DID NOT ALLOW ME TO BE VISITED BYPEACEFUL DREAMS. THE HORRIBLE SCENE OF THE PRECEDING DAY WAS FOR EVERACTING BEFORE MY EYES THE FEMALES WERE FLYING AND THE ENRAGED FELIXTEARING ME FROM HIS FATHERS FEET. I AWOKE EXHAUSTED AND FINDING THATIT WAS ALREADY NIGHT I CREPT FORTH FROM MY HIDINGPLACE AND WENT INSEARCH OF FOOD.WHEN MY HUNGER WAS APPEASED I DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARDS THEWELLKNOWN PATH THAT CONDUCTED TO THE COTTAGE. ALL THERE WAS AT PEACE.I CREPT INTO MY HOVEL AND REMAINED IN SILENT EXPECTATION OF THEACCUSTOMED HOUR WHEN THE FAMILY AROSE. THAT HOUR PASSED THE SUNMOUNTED HIGH IN THE HEAVENS BUT THE COTTAGERS DID NOT APPEAR. ITREMBLED VIOLENTLY APPREHENDING SOME DREADFUL MISFORTUNE. THE INSIDEOF THE COTTAGE WAS DARK AND I HEARD NO MOTION I CANNOT DESCRIBE THEAGONY OF THIS SUSPENSE.PRESENTLY TWO COUNTRYMEN PASSED BY BUT PAUSING NEAR THE COTTAGE THEYENTERED INTO CONVERSATION USING VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS BUT I DID NOTUNDERSTAND WHAT THEY SAID AS THEY SPOKE THE LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRYWHICH DIFFERED FROM THAT OF MY PROTECTORS. SOON AFTER HOWEVER FELIXAPPROACHED WITH ANOTHER MAN I WAS SURPRISED AS I KNEW THAT HE HAD NOTQUITTED THE COTTAGE THAT MORNING AND WAITED ANXIOUSLY TO DISCOVER FROMHIS DISCOURSE THE MEANING OF THESE UNUSUAL APPEARANCES.DO YOU CONSIDER SAID HIS COMPANION TO HIMTHAT YOU WILL BE OBLIGED TO PAY THREE MONTHS RENT AND TO LOSETHE PRODUCE OF YOUR GARDEN I DO NOT WISH TO TAKE ANY UNFAIR ADVANTAGE ANDI BEG THEREFORE THAT YOU WILL TAKE SOME DAYS TO CONSIDER OF YOURDETERMINATION.IT IS UTTERLY USELESS REPLIED FELIX WE CANNEVER AGAIN INHABIT YOUR COTTAGE. THE LIFE OF MY FATHER IS IN THE GREATESTDANGER OWING TO THE DREADFUL CIRCUMSTANCE THAT I HAVE RELATED. MY WIFE ANDMY SISTER WILL NEVER RECOVER FROM THEIR HORROR. I ENTREAT YOU NOT TO REASONWITH ME ANY MORE. TAKE POSSESSION OF YOUR TENEMENT AND LET ME FLY FROM THISPLACE.FELIX TREMBLED VIOLENTLY AS HE SAID THIS. HE AND HIS COMPANIONENTERED THE COTTAGE IN WHICH THEY REMAINED FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THENDEPARTED. I NEVER SAW ANY OF THE FAMILY OF DE LACEY MORE.I CONTINUED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY IN MY HOVEL IN A STATE OFUTTER AND STUPID DESPAIR. MY PROTECTORS HAD DEPARTED AND HAD BROKENTHE ONLY LINK THAT HELD ME TO THE WORLD. FOR THE FIRST TIME THEFEELINGS OF REVENGE AND HATRED FILLED MY BOSOM AND I DID NOT STRIVE TOCONTROL THEM BUT ALLOWING MYSELF TO BE BORNE AWAY BY THE STREAM IBENT MY MIND TOWARDS INJURY AND DEATH. WHEN I THOUGHT OF MY FRIENDSOF THE MILD VOICE OF DE LACEY THE GENTLE EYES OF AGATHA AND THEEXQUISITE BEAUTY OF THE ARABIAN THESE THOUGHTS VANISHED AND A GUSH OFTEARS SOMEWHAT SOOTHED ME. BUT AGAIN WHEN I REFLECTED THAT THEY HADSPURNED AND DESERTED ME ANGER RETURNED A RAGE OF ANGER AND UNABLE TOINJURE ANYTHING HUMAN I TURNED MY FURY TOWARDS INANIMATE OBJECTS. ASNIGHT ADVANCED I PLACED A VARIETY OF COMBUSTIBLES AROUND THE COTTAGEAND AFTER HAVING DESTROYED EVERY VESTIGE OF CULTIVATION IN THE GARDENI WAITED WITH FORCED IMPATIENCE UNTIL THE MOON HAD SUNK TO COMMENCE MYOPERATIONS.AS THE NIGHT ADVANCED A FIERCE WIND AROSE FROM THE WOODS AND QUICKLYDISPERSED THE CLOUDS THAT HAD LOITERED IN THE HEAVENS THE BLAST TOREALONG LIKE A MIGHTY AVALANCHE AND PRODUCED A KIND OF INSANITY IN MYSPIRITS THAT BURST ALL BOUNDS OF REASON AND REFLECTION. I LIGHTED THEDRY BRANCH OF A TREE AND DANCED WITH FURY AROUND THE DEVOTED COTTAGEMY EYES STILL FIXED ON THE WESTERN HORIZON THE EDGE OF WHICH THE MOONNEARLY TOUCHED. A PART OF ITS ORB WAS AT LENGTH HID AND I WAVED MYBRAND IT SANK AND WITH A LOUD SCREAM I FIRED THE STRAW AND HEATHAND BUSHES WHICH I HAD COLLECTED. THE WIND FANNED THE FIRE AND THECOTTAGE WAS QUICKLY ENVELOPED BY THE FLAMES WHICH CLUNG TO IT ANDLICKED IT WITH THEIR FORKED AND DESTROYING TONGUES.AS SOON AS I WAS CONVINCED THAT NO ASSISTANCE COULD SAVE ANY PART OFTHE HABITATION I QUITTED THE SCENE AND SOUGHT FOR REFUGE IN THE WOODS.AND NOW WITH THE WORLD BEFORE ME WHITHER SHOULD I BEND MY STEPS IRESOLVED TO FLY FAR FROM THE SCENE OF MY MISFORTUNES BUT TO ME HATEDAND DESPISED EVERY COUNTRY MUST BE EQUALLY HORRIBLE. AT LENGTH THETHOUGHT OF YOU CROSSED MY MIND. I LEARNED FROM YOUR PAPERS THAT YOUWERE MY FATHER MY CREATOR AND TO WHOM COULD I APPLY WITH MORE FITNESSTHAN TO HIM WHO HAD GIVEN ME LIFE AMONG THE LESSONS THAT FELIX HADBESTOWED UPON SAFIE GEOGRAPHY HAD NOT BEEN OMITTED I HAD LEARNED FROMTHESE THE RELATIVE SITUATIONS OF THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OF THE EARTH.YOU HAD MENTIONED GENEVA AS THE NAME OF YOUR NATIVE TOWN AND TOWARDSTHIS PLACE I RESOLVED TO PROCEED.BUT HOW WAS I TO DIRECT MYSELF I KNEW THAT I MUST TRAVEL IN ASOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION TO REACH MY DESTINATION BUT THE SUN WAS MYONLY GUIDE. I DID NOT KNOW THE NAMES OF THE TOWNS THAT I WAS TO PASSTHROUGH NOR COULD I ASK INFORMATION FROM A SINGLE HUMAN BEING BUT IDID NOT DESPAIR. FROM YOU ONLY COULD I HOPE FOR SUCCOUR ALTHOUGHTOWARDS YOU I FELT NO SENTIMENT BUT THAT OF HATRED. UNFEELINGHEARTLESS CREATOR YOU HAD ENDOWED ME WITH PERCEPTIONS AND PASSIONSAND THEN CAST ME ABROAD AN OBJECT FOR THE SCORN AND HORROR OF MANKIND.BUT ON YOU ONLY HAD I ANY CLAIM FOR PITY AND REDRESS AND FROM YOU IDETERMINED TO SEEK THAT JUSTICE WHICH I VAINLY ATTEMPTED TO GAIN FROMANY OTHER BEING THAT WORE THE HUMAN FORM.MY TRAVELS WERE LONG AND THE SUFFERINGS I ENDURED INTENSE. IT WASLATE IN AUTUMN WHEN I QUITTED THE DISTRICT WHERE I HAD SO LONG RESIDED.I TRAVELLED ONLY AT NIGHT FEARFUL OF ENCOUNTERING THE VISAGE OF AHUMAN BEING. NATURE DECAYED AROUND ME AND THE SUN BECAME HEATLESSRAIN AND SNOW POURED AROUND ME MIGHTY RIVERS WERE FROZEN THE SURFACEOF THE EARTH WAS HARD AND CHILL AND BARE AND I FOUND NO SHELTER. OHEARTH HOW OFTEN DID I IMPRECATE CURSES ON THE CAUSE OF MY BEING THEMILDNESS OF MY NATURE HAD FLED AND ALL WITHIN ME WAS TURNED TO GALLAND BITTERNESS. THE NEARER I APPROACHED TO YOUR HABITATION THE MOREDEEPLY DID I FEEL THE SPIRIT OF REVENGE ENKINDLED IN MY HEART. SNOWFELL AND THE WATERS WERE HARDENED BUT I RESTED NOT. A FEW INCIDENTSNOW AND THEN DIRECTED ME AND I POSSESSED A MAP OF THE COUNTRY BUT IOFTEN WANDERED WIDE FROM MY PATH. THE AGONY OF MY FEELINGS ALLOWED MENO RESPITE NO INCIDENT OCCURRED FROM WHICH MY RAGE AND MISERY COULDNOT EXTRACT ITS FOOD BUT A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAPPENED WHEN I ARRIVEDON THE CONFINES OF SWITZERLAND WHEN THE SUN HAD RECOVERED ITS WARMTHAND THE EARTH AGAIN BEGAN TO LOOK GREEN CONFIRMED IN AN ESPECIALMANNER THE BITTERNESS AND HORROR OF MY FEELINGS.I GENERALLY RESTED DURING THE DAY AND TRAVELLED ONLY WHEN I WASSECURED BY NIGHT FROM THE VIEW OF MAN. ONE MORNING HOWEVER FINDINGTHAT MY PATH LAY THROUGH A DEEP WOOD I VENTURED TO CONTINUE MY JOURNEYAFTER THE SUN HAD RISEN THE DAY WHICH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OF SPRINGCHEERED EVEN ME BY THE LOVELINESS OF ITS SUNSHINE AND THE BALMINESS OFTHE AIR. I FELT EMOTIONS OF GENTLENESS AND PLEASURE THAT HAD LONGAPPEARED DEAD REVIVE WITHIN ME. HALF SURPRISED BY THE NOVELTY OFTHESE SENSATIONS I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE BORNE AWAY BY THEM ANDFORGETTING MY SOLITUDE AND DEFORMITY DARED TO BE HAPPY. SOFT TEARSAGAIN BEDEWED MY CHEEKS AND I EVEN RAISED MY HUMID EYES WITHTHANKFULNESS TOWARDS THE BLESSED SUN WHICH BESTOWED SUCH JOY UPON ME.I CONTINUED TO WIND AMONG THE PATHS OF THE WOOD UNTIL I CAME TO ITSBOUNDARY WHICH WAS SKIRTED BY A DEEP AND RAPID RIVER INTO WHICH MANYOF THE TREES BENT THEIR BRANCHES NOW BUDDING WITH THE FRESH SPRING.HERE I PAUSED NOT EXACTLY KNOWING WHAT PATH TO PURSUE WHEN I HEARDTHE SOUND OF VOICES THAT INDUCED ME TO CONCEAL MYSELF UNDER THE SHADEOF A CYPRESS. I WAS SCARCELY HID WHEN A YOUNG GIRL CAME RUNNINGTOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE I WAS CONCEALED LAUGHING AS IF SHE RAN FROMSOMEONE IN SPORT. SHE CONTINUED HER COURSE ALONG THE PRECIPITOUS SIDESOF THE RIVER WHEN SUDDENLY HER FOOT SLIPPED AND SHE FELL INTO THERAPID STREAM. I RUSHED FROM MY HIDINGPLACE AND WITH EXTREME LABOURFROM THE FORCE OF THE CURRENT SAVED HER AND DRAGGED HER TO SHORE. SHEWAS SENSELESS AND I ENDEAVOURED BY EVERY MEANS IN MY POWER TO RESTOREANIMATION WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED BY THE APPROACH OF A RUSTICWHO WAS PROBABLY THE PERSON FROM WHOM SHE HAD PLAYFULLY FLED. ONSEEING ME HE DARTED TOWARDS ME AND TEARING THE GIRL FROM MY ARMSHASTENED TOWARDS THE DEEPER PARTS OF THE WOOD. I FOLLOWED SPEEDILY IHARDLY KNEW WHY BUT WHEN THE MAN SAW ME DRAW NEAR HE AIMED A GUNWHICH HE CARRIED AT MY BODY AND FIRED. I SANK TO THE GROUND AND MYINJURER WITH INCREASED SWIFTNESS ESCAPED INTO THE WOOD.THIS WAS THEN THE REWARD OF MY BENEVOLENCE I HAD SAVED A HUMAN BEINGFROM DESTRUCTION AND AS A RECOMPENSE I NOW WRITHED UNDER THE MISERABLEPAIN OF A WOUND WHICH SHATTERED THE FLESH AND BONE. THE FEELINGS OFKINDNESS AND GENTLENESS WHICH I HAD ENTERTAINED BUT A FEW MOMENTSBEFORE GAVE PLACE TO HELLISH RAGE AND GNASHING OF TEETH. INFLAMED BYPAIN I VOWED ETERNAL HATRED AND VENGEANCE TO ALL MANKIND. BUT THEAGONY OF MY WOUND OVERCAME ME MY PULSES PAUSED AND I FAINTED.FOR SOME WEEKS I LED A MISERABLE LIFE IN THE WOODS ENDEAVOURING TOCURE THE WOUND WHICH I HAD RECEIVED. THE BALL HAD ENTERED MY SHOULDERAND I KNEW NOT WHETHER IT HAD REMAINED THERE OR PASSED THROUGH AT ANYRATE I HAD NO MEANS OF EXTRACTING IT. MY SUFFERINGS WERE AUGMENTEDALSO BY THE OPPRESSIVE SENSE OF THE INJUSTICE AND INGRATITUDE OF THEIRINFLICTION. MY DAILY VOWS ROSE FOR REVENGEA DEEP AND DEADLY REVENGESUCH AS WOULD ALONE COMPENSATE FOR THE OUTRAGES AND ANGUISH I HADENDURED.AFTER SOME WEEKS MY WOUND HEALED AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY. THELABOURS I ENDURED WERE NO LONGER TO BE ALLEVIATED BY THE BRIGHT SUN ORGENTLE BREEZES OF SPRING ALL JOY WAS BUT A MOCKERY WHICH INSULTED MYDESOLATE STATE AND MADE ME FEEL MORE PAINFULLY THAT I WAS NOT MADE FORTHE ENJOYMENT OF PLEASURE.BUT MY TOILS NOW DREW NEAR A CLOSE AND IN TWO MONTHS FROM THIS TIME IREACHED THE ENVIRONS OF GENEVA.IT WAS EVENING WHEN I ARRIVED AND I RETIRED TO A HIDINGPLACE AMONGTHE FIELDS THAT SURROUND IT TO MEDITATE IN WHAT MANNER I SHOULD APPLYTO YOU. I WAS OPPRESSED BY FATIGUE AND HUNGER AND FAR TOO UNHAPPY TOENJOY THE GENTLE BREEZES OF EVENING OR THE PROSPECT OF THE SUN SETTINGBEHIND THE STUPENDOUS MOUNTAINS OF JURA.AT THIS TIME A SLIGHT SLEEP RELIEVED ME FROM THE PAIN OF REFLECTIONWHICH WAS DISTURBED BY THE APPROACH OF A BEAUTIFUL CHILD WHO CAMERUNNING INTO THE RECESS I HAD CHOSEN WITH ALL THE SPORTIVENESS OFINFANCY. SUDDENLY AS I GAZED ON HIM AN IDEA SEIZED ME THAT THISLITTLE CREATURE WAS UNPREJUDICED AND HAD LIVED TOO SHORT A TIME TO HAVEIMBIBED A HORROR OF DEFORMITY. IF THEREFORE I COULD SEIZE HIM ANDEDUCATE HIM AS MY COMPANION AND FRIEND I SHOULD NOT BE SO DESOLATE INTHIS PEOPLED EARTH.URGED BY THIS IMPULSE I SEIZED ON THE BOY AS HE PASSED AND DREW HIMTOWARDS ME. AS SOON AS HE BEHELD MY FORM HE PLACED HIS HANDS BEFOREHIS EYES AND UTTERED A SHRILL SCREAM I DREW HIS HAND FORCIBLY FROM HISFACE AND SAID CHILD WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS I DO NOT INTEND TOHURT YOU LISTEN TO ME.HE STRUGGLED VIOLENTLY. LET ME GO HE CRIEDMONSTER UGLY WRETCH YOU WISH TO EAT ME AND TEAR ME TO PIECES. YOUARE AN OGRE. LET ME GO OR I WILL TELL MY PAPA.BOY YOU WILL NEVER SEE YOUR FATHER AGAIN YOU MUST COME WITH ME.HIDEOUS MONSTER LET ME GO. MY PAPA IS A SYNDICHE IS M.FRANKENSTEINHE WILL PUNISH YOU. YOU DARE NOT KEEP ME.FRANKENSTEIN YOU BELONG THEN TO MY ENEMYTO HIM TOWARDS WHOM I HAVESWORN ETERNAL REVENGE YOU SHALL BE MY FIRST VICTIM.THE CHILD STILL STRUGGLED AND LOADED ME WITH EPITHETS WHICH CARRIEDDESPAIR TO MY HEART I GRASPED HIS THROAT TO SILENCE HIM AND IN AMOMENT HE LAY DEAD AT MY FEET.I GAZED ON MY VICTIM AND MY HEART SWELLED WITH EXULTATION AND HELLISHTRIUMPH CLAPPING MY HANDS I EXCLAIMED I TOO CAN CREATE DESOLATIONMY ENEMY IS NOT INVULNERABLE THIS DEATH WILL CARRY DESPAIR TO HIM ANDA THOUSAND OTHER MISERIES SHALL TORMENT AND DESTROY HIM.AS I FIXED MY EYES ON THE CHILD I SAW SOMETHING GLITTERING ON HISBREAST. I TOOK IT IT WAS A PORTRAIT OF A MOST LOVELY WOMAN. IN SPITEOF MY MALIGNITY IT SOFTENED AND ATTRACTED ME. FOR A FEW MOMENTS IGAZED WITH DELIGHT ON HER DARK EYES FRINGED BY DEEP LASHES AND HERLOVELY LIPS BUT PRESENTLY MY RAGE RETURNED I REMEMBERED THAT I WASFOR EVER DEPRIVED OF THE DELIGHTS THAT SUCH BEAUTIFUL CREATURES COULDBESTOW AND THAT SHE WHOSE RESEMBLANCE I CONTEMPLATED WOULD INREGARDING ME HAVE CHANGED THAT AIR OF DIVINE BENIGNITY TO ONEEXPRESSIVE OF DISGUST AND AFFRIGHT.CAN YOU WONDER THAT SUCH THOUGHTS TRANSPORTED ME WITH RAGE I ONLYWONDER THAT AT THAT MOMENT INSTEAD OF VENTING MY SENSATIONS INEXCLAMATIONS AND AGONY I DID NOT RUSH AMONG MANKIND AND PERISH IN THEATTEMPT TO DESTROY THEM.WHILE I WAS OVERCOME BY THESE FEELINGS I LEFT THE SPOT WHERE I HADCOMMITTED THE MURDER AND SEEKING A MORE SECLUDED HIDINGPLACE IENTERED A BARN WHICH HAD APPEARED TO ME TO BE EMPTY. A WOMAN WASSLEEPING ON SOME STRAW SHE WAS YOUNG NOT INDEED SO BEAUTIFUL AS HERWHOSE PORTRAIT I HELD BUT OF AN AGREEABLE ASPECT AND BLOOMING IN THELOVELINESS OF YOUTH AND HEALTH. HERE I THOUGHT IS ONE OF THOSE WHOSEJOYIMPARTING SMILES ARE BESTOWED ON ALL BUT ME. AND THEN I BENT OVERHER AND WHISPERED AWAKE FAIREST THY LOVER IS NEARHE WHO WOULDGIVE HIS LIFE BUT TO OBTAIN ONE LOOK OF AFFECTION FROM THINE EYES MYBELOVED AWAKETHE SLEEPER STIRRED A THRILL OF TERROR RAN THROUGH ME. SHOULD SHEINDEED AWAKE AND SEE ME AND CURSE ME AND DENOUNCE THE MURDERER THUSWOULD SHE ASSUREDLY ACT IF HER DARKENED EYES OPENED AND SHE BEHELD ME.THE THOUGHT WAS MADNESS IT STIRRED THE FIEND WITHIN MENOT I BUTSHE SHALL SUFFER THE MURDER I HAVE COMMITTED BECAUSE I AM FOR EVERROBBED OF ALL THAT SHE COULD GIVE ME SHE SHALL ATONE. THE CRIME HADITS SOURCE IN HER BE HERS THE PUNISHMENT THANKS TO THE LESSONS OFFELIX AND THE SANGUINARY LAWS OF MAN I HAD LEARNED NOW TO WORKMISCHIEF. I BENT OVER HER AND PLACED THE PORTRAIT SECURELY IN ONE OFTHE FOLDS OF HER DRESS. SHE MOVED AGAIN AND I FLED.FOR SOME DAYS I HAUNTED THE SPOT WHERE THESE SCENES HAD TAKEN PLACESOMETIMES WISHING TO SEE YOU SOMETIMES RESOLVED TO QUIT THE WORLD ANDITS MISERIES FOR EVER. AT LENGTH I WANDERED TOWARDS THESE MOUNTAINSAND HAVE RANGED THROUGH THEIR IMMENSE RECESSES CONSUMED BY A BURNINGPASSION WHICH YOU ALONE CAN GRATIFY. WE MAY NOT PART UNTIL YOU HAVEPROMISED TO COMPLY WITH MY REQUISITION. I AM ALONE AND MISERABLE MANWILL NOT ASSOCIATE WITH ME BUT ONE AS DEFORMED AND HORRIBLE AS MYSELFWOULD NOT DENY HERSELF TO ME. MY COMPANION MUST BE OF THE SAME SPECIESAND HAVE THE SAME DEFECTS. THIS BEING YOU MUST CREATE.CHAPTER THE BEING FINISHED SPEAKING AND FIXED HIS LOOKS UPON ME IN THEEXPECTATION OF A REPLY. BUT I WAS BEWILDERED PERPLEXED AND UNABLE TOARRANGE MY IDEAS SUFFICIENTLY TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL EXTENT OF HISPROPOSITION. HE CONTINUEDYOU MUST CREATE A FEMALE FOR ME WITH WHOM I CAN LIVE IN THEINTERCHANGE OF THOSE SYMPATHIES NECESSARY FOR MY BEING. THIS YOU ALONECAN DO AND I DEMAND IT OF YOU AS A RIGHT WHICH YOU MUST NOT REFUSE TOCONCEDE.THE LATTER PART OF HIS TALE HAD KINDLED ANEW IN ME THE ANGER THAT HADDIED AWAY WHILE HE NARRATED HIS PEACEFUL LIFE AMONG THE COTTAGERS ANDAS HE SAID THIS I COULD NO LONGER SUPPRESS THE RAGE THAT BURNED WITHINME.I DO REFUSE IT I REPLIED AND NO TORTURE SHALL EVER EXTORT ACONSENT FROM ME. YOU MAY RENDER ME THE MOST MISERABLE OF MEN BUT YOUSHALL NEVER MAKE ME BASE IN MY OWN EYES. SHALL I CREATE ANOTHER LIKEYOURSELF WHOSE JOINT WICKEDNESS MIGHT DESOLATE THE WORLD. BEGONE IHAVE ANSWERED YOU YOU MAY TORTURE ME BUT I WILL NEVER CONSENT.YOU ARE IN THE WRONG REPLIED THE FIEND AND INSTEADOF THREATENING I AM CONTENT TO REASON WITH YOU. I AM MALICIOUS BECAUSE IAM MISERABLE. AM I NOT SHUNNED AND HATED BY ALL MANKIND YOU MY CREATORWOULD TEAR ME TO PIECES AND TRIUMPH REMEMBER THAT AND TELL ME WHY ISHOULD PITY MAN MORE THAN HE PITIES ME YOU WOULD NOT CALL IT MURDER IF YOUCOULD PRECIPITATE ME INTO ONE OF THOSE ICERIFTS AND DESTROY MY FRAME THEWORK OF YOUR OWN HANDS. SHALL I RESPECT MAN WHEN HE CONDEMNS ME LET HIMLIVE WITH ME IN THE INTERCHANGE OF KINDNESS AND INSTEAD OF INJURY I WOULDBESTOW EVERY BENEFIT UPON HIM WITH TEARS OF GRATITUDE AT HIS ACCEPTANCE.BUT THAT CANNOT BE THE HUMAN SENSES ARE INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS TO OURUNION. YET MINE SHALL NOT BE THE SUBMISSION OF ABJECT SLAVERY. I WILLREVENGE MY INJURIES IF I CANNOT INSPIRE LOVE I WILL CAUSE FEAR ANDCHIEFLY TOWARDS YOU MY ARCHENEMY BECAUSE MY CREATOR DO I SWEARINEXTINGUISHABLE HATRED. HAVE A CARE I WILL WORK AT YOUR DESTRUCTION NORFINISH UNTIL I DESOLATE YOUR HEART SO THAT YOU SHALL CURSE THE HOUR OFYOUR BIRTH.A FIENDISH RAGE ANIMATED HIM AS HE SAID THIS HIS FACE WAS WRINKLEDINTO CONTORTIONS TOO HORRIBLE FOR HUMAN EYES TO BEHOLD BUT PRESENTLYHE CALMED HIMSELF AND PROCEEDEDI INTENDED TO REASON. THIS PASSION IS DETRIMENTAL TO ME FOR YOU DONOT REFLECT THAT YOU ARE THE CAUSE OF ITS EXCESS. IF ANY BEING FELTEMOTIONS OF BENEVOLENCE TOWARDS ME I SHOULD RETURN THEM A HUNDRED AND AHUNDREDFOLD FOR THAT ONE CREATURES SAKE I WOULD MAKE PEACE WITH THEWHOLE KIND BUT I NOW INDULGE IN DREAMS OF BLISS THAT CANNOT BE REALISED.WHAT I ASK OF YOU IS REASONABLE AND MODERATE I DEMAND A CREATURE OFANOTHER SEX BUT AS HIDEOUS AS MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION IS SMALL BUT ITIS ALL THAT I CAN RECEIVE AND IT SHALL CONTENT ME. IT IS TRUE WE SHALL BEMONSTERS CUT OFF FROM ALL THE WORLD BUT ON THAT ACCOUNT WE SHALL BE MOREATTACHED TO ONE ANOTHER. OUR LIVES WILL NOT BE HAPPY BUT THEY WILL BEHARMLESS AND FREE FROM THE MISERY I NOW FEEL. OH MY CREATOR MAKE MEHAPPY LET ME FEEL GRATITUDE TOWARDS YOU FOR ONE BENEFIT LET ME SEE THAT IEXCITE THE SYMPATHY OF SOME EXISTING THING DO NOT DENY ME MYREQUESTI WAS MOVED. I SHUDDERED WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCESOF MY CONSENT BUT I FELT THAT THERE WAS SOME JUSTICE IN HIS ARGUMENT.HIS TALE AND THE FEELINGS HE NOW EXPRESSED PROVED HIM TO BE A CREATUREOF FINE SENSATIONS AND DID I NOT AS HIS MAKER OWE HIM ALL THE PORTIONOF HAPPINESS THAT IT WAS IN MY POWER TO BESTOW HE SAW MY CHANGE OFFEELING AND CONTINUEDIF YOU CONSENT NEITHER YOU NOR ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING SHALL EVER SEEUS AGAIN I WILL GO TO THE VAST WILDS OF SOUTH AMERICA. MY FOOD IS NOTTHAT OF MAN I DO NOT DESTROY THE LAMB AND THE KID TO GLUT MY APPETITEACORNS AND BERRIES AFFORD ME SUFFICIENT NOURISHMENT. MY COMPANION WILLBE OF THE SAME NATURE AS MYSELF AND WILL BE CONTENT WITH THE SAME FARE.WE SHALL MAKE OUR BED OF DRIED LEAVES THE SUN WILL SHINE ON US AS ONMAN AND WILL RIPEN OUR FOOD. THE PICTURE I PRESENT TO YOU IS PEACEFULAND HUMAN AND YOU MUST FEEL THAT YOU COULD DENY IT ONLY IN THEWANTONNESS OF POWER AND CRUELTY. PITILESS AS YOU HAVE BEEN TOWARDS MEI NOW SEE COMPASSION IN YOUR EYES LET ME SEIZE THE FAVOURABLE MOMENTAND PERSUADE YOU TO PROMISE WHAT I SO ARDENTLY DESIRE.YOU PROPOSE REPLIED I TO FLY FROM THE HABITATIONS OFMAN TO DWELL IN THOSE WILDS WHERE THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD WILL BE YOURONLY COMPANIONS. HOW CAN YOU WHO LONG FOR THE LOVE AND SYMPATHY OF MANPERSEVERE IN THIS EXILE YOU WILL RETURN AND AGAIN SEEK THEIR KINDNESS ANDYOU WILL MEET WITH THEIR DETESTATION YOUR EVIL PASSIONS WILL BE RENEWEDAND YOU WILL THEN HAVE A COMPANION TO AID YOU IN THE TASK OF DESTRUCTION.THIS MAY NOT BE CEASE TO ARGUE THE POINT FOR I CANNOT CONSENT.HOW INCONSTANT ARE YOUR FEELINGS BUT A MOMENT AGO YOU WERE MOVED BYMY REPRESENTATIONS AND WHY DO YOU AGAIN HARDEN YOURSELF TO MY COMPLAINTSI SWEAR TO YOU BY THE EARTH WHICH I INHABIT AND BY YOU THAT MADE ME THATWITH THE COMPANION YOU BESTOW I WILL QUIT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN ANDDWELL AS IT MAY CHANCE IN THE MOST SAVAGE OF PLACES. MY EVIL PASSIONSWILL HAVE FLED FOR I SHALL MEET WITH SYMPATHY MY LIFE WILL FLOW QUIETLYAWAY AND IN MY DYING MOMENTS I SHALL NOT CURSE MY MAKER.HIS WORDS HAD A STRANGE EFFECT UPON ME. I COMPASSIONATED HIM ANDSOMETIMES FELT A WISH TO CONSOLE HIM BUT WHEN I LOOKED UPON HIM WHENI SAW THE FILTHY MASS THAT MOVED AND TALKED MY HEART SICKENED AND MYFEELINGS WERE ALTERED TO THOSE OF HORROR AND HATRED. I TRIED TO STIFLETHESE SENSATIONS I THOUGHT THAT AS I COULD NOT SYMPATHISE WITH HIM IHAD NO RIGHT TO WITHHOLD FROM HIM THE SMALL PORTION OF HAPPINESS WHICHWAS YET IN MY POWER TO BESTOW.YOU SWEAR I SAID TO BE HARMLESS BUT HAVE YOU NOTALREADY SHOWN A DEGREE OF MALICE THAT SHOULD REASONABLY MAKE ME DISTRUSTYOU MAY NOT EVEN THIS BE A FEINT THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR TRIUMPH BYAFFORDING A WIDER SCOPE FOR YOUR REVENGEHOW IS THIS I MUST NOT BE TRIFLED WITH AND I DEMAND AN ANSWER. IFI HAVE NO TIES AND NO AFFECTIONS HATRED AND VICE MUST BE MY PORTIONTHE LOVE OF ANOTHER WILL DESTROY THE CAUSE OF MY CRIMES AND I SHALLBECOME A THING OF WHOSE EXISTENCE EVERYONE WILL BE IGNORANT. MY VICESARE THE CHILDREN OF A FORCED SOLITUDE THAT I ABHOR AND MY VIRTUES WILLNECESSARILY ARISE WHEN I LIVE IN COMMUNION WITH AN EQUAL. I SHALL FEELTHE AFFECTIONS OF A SENSITIVE BEING AND BECOME LINKED TO THE CHAIN OFEXISTENCE AND EVENTS FROM WHICH I AM NOW EXCLUDED.I PAUSED SOME TIME TO REFLECT ON ALL HE HAD RELATED AND THE VARIOUSARGUMENTS WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED. I THOUGHT OF THE PROMISE OF VIRTUES WHICHHE HAD DISPLAYED ON THE OPENING OF HIS EXISTENCE AND THE SUBSEQUENT BLIGHTOF ALL KINDLY FEELING BY THE LOATHING AND SCORN WHICH HIS PROTECTORS HADMANIFESTED TOWARDS HIM. HIS POWER AND THREATS WERE NOT OMITTED IN MYCALCULATIONS A CREATURE WHO COULD EXIST IN THE ICECAVES OF THE GLACIERSAND HIDE HIMSELF FROM PURSUIT AMONG THE RIDGES OF INACCESSIBLE PRECIPICESWAS A BEING POSSESSING FACULTIES IT WOULD BE VAIN TO COPE WITH. AFTER ALONG PAUSE OF REFLECTION I CONCLUDED THAT THE JUSTICE DUE BOTH TO HIM ANDMY FELLOW CREATURES DEMANDED OF ME THAT I SHOULD COMPLY WITH HIS REQUEST.TURNING TO HIM THEREFORE I SAIDI CONSENT TO YOUR DEMAND ON YOUR SOLEMN OATH TO QUIT EUROPE FOR EVERAND EVERY OTHER PLACE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AS SOON AS I SHALLDELIVER INTO YOUR HANDS A FEMALE WHO WILL ACCOMPANY YOU IN YOUR EXILE.I SWEAR HE CRIED BY THE SUN AND BY THE BLUE SKY OFHEAVEN AND BY THE FIRE OF LOVE THAT BURNS MY HEART THAT IF YOU GRANT MYPRAYER WHILE THEY EXIST YOU SHALL NEVER BEHOLD ME AGAIN. DEPART TO YOURHOME AND COMMENCE YOUR LABOURS I SHALL WATCH THEIR PROGRESS WITHUNUTTERABLE ANXIETY AND FEAR NOT BUT THAT WHEN YOU ARE READY I SHALLAPPEAR.SAYING THIS HE SUDDENLY QUITTED ME FEARFUL PERHAPS OF ANY CHANGE INMY SENTIMENTS. I SAW HIM DESCEND THE MOUNTAIN WITH GREATER SPEED THANTHE FLIGHT OF AN EAGLE AND QUICKLY LOST AMONG THE UNDULATIONS OF THESEA OF ICE.HIS TALE HAD OCCUPIED THE WHOLE DAY AND THE SUN WAS UPON THE VERGE OFTHE HORIZON WHEN HE DEPARTED. I KNEW THAT I OUGHT TO HASTEN MY DESCENTTOWARDS THE VALLEY AS I SHOULD SOON BE ENCOMPASSED IN DARKNESS BUT MYHEART WAS HEAVY AND MY STEPS SLOW. THE LABOUR OF WINDING AMONG THELITTLE PATHS OF THE MOUNTAIN AND FIXING MY FEET FIRMLY AS I ADVANCEDPERPLEXED ME OCCUPIED AS I WAS BY THE EMOTIONS WHICH THE OCCURRENCESOF THE DAY HAD PRODUCED. NIGHT WAS FAR ADVANCED WHEN I CAME TO THEHALFWAY RESTINGPLACE AND SEATED MYSELF BESIDE THE FOUNTAIN. THE STARSSHONE AT INTERVALS AS THE CLOUDS PASSED FROM OVER THEM THE DARK PINESROSE BEFORE ME AND EVERY HERE AND THERE A BROKEN TREE LAY ON THEGROUND IT WAS A SCENE OF WONDERFUL SOLEMNITY AND STIRRED STRANGETHOUGHTS WITHIN ME. I WEPT BITTERLY AND CLASPING MY HANDS IN AGONY IEXCLAIMED OH STARS AND CLOUDS AND WINDS YE ARE ALL ABOUT TO MOCKME IF YE REALLY PITY ME CRUSH SENSATION AND MEMORY LET ME BECOME ASNOUGHT BUT IF NOT DEPART DEPART AND LEAVE ME IN DARKNESS.THESE WERE WILD AND MISERABLE THOUGHTS BUT I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOUHOW THE ETERNAL TWINKLING OF THE STARS WEIGHED UPON ME AND HOW ILISTENED TO EVERY BLAST OF WIND AS IF IT WERE A DULL UGLY SIROC ON ITSWAY TO CONSUME ME.MORNING DAWNED BEFORE I ARRIVED AT THE VILLAGE OF CHAMOUNIX I TOOK NOREST BUT RETURNED IMMEDIATELY TO GENEVA. EVEN IN MY OWN HEART I COULDGIVE NO EXPRESSION TO MY SENSATIONSTHEY WEIGHED ON ME WITH AMOUNTAINS WEIGHT AND THEIR EXCESS DESTROYED MY AGONY BENEATH THEM.THUS I RETURNED HOME AND ENTERING THE HOUSE PRESENTED MYSELF TO THEFAMILY. MY HAGGARD AND WILD APPEARANCE AWOKE INTENSE ALARM BUT IANSWERED NO QUESTION SCARCELY DID I SPEAK. I FELT AS IF I WERE PLACEDUNDER A BANAS IF I HAD NO RIGHT TO CLAIM THEIR SYMPATHIESAS IFNEVER MORE MIGHT I ENJOY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THEM. YET EVEN THUS ILOVED THEM TO ADORATION AND TO SAVE THEM I RESOLVED TO DEDICATEMYSELF TO MY MOST ABHORRED TASK. THE PROSPECT OF SUCH AN OCCUPATIONMADE EVERY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE OF EXISTENCE PASS BEFORE ME LIKE A DREAMAND THAT THOUGHT ONLY HAD TO ME THE REALITY OF LIFE.CHAPTER DAY AFTER DAY WEEK AFTER WEEK PASSED AWAY ON MY RETURN TO GENEVA ANDI COULD NOT COLLECT THE COURAGE TO RECOMMENCE MY WORK. I FEARED THEVENGEANCE OF THE DISAPPOINTED FIEND YET I WAS UNABLE TO OVERCOME MYREPUGNANCE TO THE TASK WHICH WAS ENJOINED ME. I FOUND THAT I COULD NOTCOMPOSE A FEMALE WITHOUT AGAIN DEVOTING SEVERAL MONTHS TO PROFOUNDSTUDY AND LABORIOUS DISQUISITION. I HAD HEARD OF SOME DISCOVERIESHAVING BEEN MADE BY AN ENGLISH PHILOSOPHER THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH WASMATERIAL TO MY SUCCESS AND I SOMETIMES THOUGHT OF OBTAINING MYFATHERS CONSENT TO VISIT ENGLAND FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT I CLUNG TOEVERY PRETENCE OF DELAY AND SHRANK FROM TAKING THE FIRST STEP IN ANUNDERTAKING WHOSE IMMEDIATE NECESSITY BEGAN TO APPEAR LESS ABSOLUTE TOME. A CHANGE INDEED HAD TAKEN PLACE IN ME MY HEALTH WHICH HADHITHERTO DECLINED WAS NOW MUCH RESTORED AND MY SPIRITS WHENUNCHECKED BY THE MEMORY OF MY UNHAPPY PROMISE ROSE PROPORTIONABLY. MYFATHER SAW THIS CHANGE WITH PLEASURE AND HE TURNED HIS THOUGHTSTOWARDS THE BEST METHOD OF ERADICATING THE REMAINS OF MY MELANCHOLYWHICH EVERY NOW AND THEN WOULD RETURN BY FITS AND WITH A DEVOURINGBLACKNESS OVERCAST THE APPROACHING SUNSHINE. AT THESE MOMENTS I TOOKREFUGE IN THE MOST PERFECT SOLITUDE. I PASSED WHOLE DAYS ON THE LAKEALONE IN A LITTLE BOAT WATCHING THE CLOUDS AND LISTENING TO THERIPPLING OF THE WAVES SILENT AND LISTLESS. BUT THE FRESH AIR ANDBRIGHT SUN SELDOM FAILED TO RESTORE ME TO SOME DEGREE OF COMPOSURE ANDON MY RETURN I MET THE SALUTATIONS OF MY FRIENDS WITH A READIER SMILEAND A MORE CHEERFUL HEART.IT WAS AFTER MY RETURN FROM ONE OF THESE RAMBLES THAT MY FATHERCALLING ME ASIDE THUS ADDRESSED MEI AM HAPPY TO REMARK MY DEAR SON THAT YOU HAVE RESUMED YOUR FORMERPLEASURES AND SEEM TO BE RETURNING TO YOURSELF. AND YET YOU ARE STILLUNHAPPY AND STILL AVOID OUR SOCIETY. FOR SOME TIME I WAS LOST INCONJECTURE AS TO THE CAUSE OF THIS BUT YESTERDAY AN IDEA STRUCK MEAND IF IT IS WELL FOUNDED I CONJURE YOU TO AVOW IT. RESERVE ON SUCH APOINT WOULD BE NOT ONLY USELESS BUT DRAW DOWN TREBLE MISERY ON US ALL.I TREMBLED VIOLENTLY AT HIS EXORDIUM AND MY FATHER CONTINUEDI CONFESS MY SON THAT I HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD TO YOURMARRIAGE WITH OUR DEAR ELIZABETH AS THE TIE OF OUR DOMESTIC COMFORT AND THESTAY OF MY DECLINING YEARS. YOU WERE ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER FROM YOUREARLIEST INFANCY YOU STUDIED TOGETHER AND APPEARED IN DISPOSITIONS ANDTASTES ENTIRELY SUITED TO ONE ANOTHER. BUT SO BLIND IS THE EXPERIENCE OFMAN THAT WHAT I CONCEIVED TO BE THE BEST ASSISTANTS TO MY PLAN MAY HAVEENTIRELY DESTROYED IT. YOU PERHAPS REGARD HER AS YOUR SISTER WITHOUT ANYWISH THAT SHE MIGHT BECOME YOUR WIFE. NAY YOU MAY HAVE MET WITH ANOTHERWHOM YOU MAY LOVE AND CONSIDERING YOURSELF AS BOUND IN HONOUR TOELIZABETH THIS STRUGGLE MAY OCCASION THE POIGNANT MISERY WHICH YOU APPEARTO FEEL.MY DEAR FATHER REASSURE YOURSELF. I LOVE MY COUSIN TENDERLY ANDSINCERELY. I NEVER SAW ANY WOMAN WHO EXCITED AS ELIZABETH DOES MYWARMEST ADMIRATION AND AFFECTION. MY FUTURE HOPES AND PROSPECTS AREENTIRELY BOUND UP IN THE EXPECTATION OF OUR UNION.THE EXPRESSION OF YOUR SENTIMENTS OF THIS SUBJECT MY DEAR VICTORGIVES ME MORE PLEASURE THAN I HAVE FOR SOME TIME EXPERIENCED. IF YOUFEEL THUS WE SHALL ASSUREDLY BE HAPPY HOWEVER PRESENT EVENTS MAY CASTA GLOOM OVER US. BUT IT IS THIS GLOOM WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE TAKEN SOSTRONG A HOLD OF YOUR MIND THAT I WISH TO DISSIPATE. TELL METHEREFORE WHETHER YOU OBJECT TO AN IMMEDIATE SOLEMNISATION OF THEMARRIAGE. WE HAVE BEEN UNFORTUNATE AND RECENT EVENTS HAVE DRAWN USFROM THAT EVERYDAY TRANQUILLITY BEFITTING MY YEARS AND INFIRMITIES. YOUARE YOUNGER YET I DO NOT SUPPOSE POSSESSED AS YOU ARE OF A COMPETENTFORTUNE THAT AN EARLY MARRIAGE WOULD AT ALL INTERFERE WITH ANY FUTUREPLANS OF HONOUR AND UTILITY THAT YOU MAY HAVE FORMED. DO NOT SUPPOSEHOWEVER THAT I WISH TO DICTATE HAPPINESS TO YOU OR THAT A DELAY ONYOUR PART WOULD CAUSE ME ANY SERIOUS UNEASINESS. INTERPRET MY WORDSWITH CANDOUR AND ANSWER ME I CONJURE YOU WITH CONFIDENCE ANDSINCERITY.I LISTENED TO MY FATHER IN SILENCE AND REMAINED FOR SOME TIME INCAPABLEOF OFFERING ANY REPLY. I REVOLVED RAPIDLY IN MY MIND A MULTITUDE OFTHOUGHTS AND ENDEAVOURED TO ARRIVE AT SOME CONCLUSION. ALAS TO METHE IDEA OF AN IMMEDIATE UNION WITH MY ELIZABETH WAS ONE OF HORROR ANDDISMAY. I WAS BOUND BY A SOLEMN PROMISE WHICH I HAD NOT YET FULFILLEDAND DARED NOT BREAK OR IF I DID WHAT MANIFOLD MISERIES MIGHT NOTIMPEND OVER ME AND MY DEVOTED FAMILY COULD I ENTER INTO A FESTIVALWITH THIS DEADLY WEIGHT YET HANGING ROUND MY NECK AND BOWING ME TO THEGROUND I MUST PERFORM MY ENGAGEMENT AND LET THE MONSTER DEPART WITHHIS MATE BEFORE I ALLOWED MYSELF TO ENJOY THE DELIGHT OF A UNION FROMWHICH I EXPECTED PEACE.I REMEMBERED ALSO THE NECESSITY IMPOSED UPON ME OF EITHER JOURNEYING TOENGLAND OR ENTERING INTO A LONG CORRESPONDENCE WITH THOSE PHILOSOPHERSOF THAT COUNTRY WHOSE KNOWLEDGE AND DISCOVERIES WERE OF INDISPENSABLEUSE TO ME IN MY PRESENT UNDERTAKING. THE LATTER METHOD OF OBTAININGTHE DESIRED INTELLIGENCE WAS DILATORY AND UNSATISFACTORY BESIDES IHAD AN INSURMOUNTABLE AVERSION TO THE IDEA OF ENGAGING MYSELF IN MYLOATHSOME TASK IN MY FATHERS HOUSE WHILE IN HABITS OF FAMILIARINTERCOURSE WITH THOSE I LOVED. I KNEW THAT A THOUSAND FEARFULACCIDENTS MIGHT OCCUR THE SLIGHTEST OF WHICH WOULD DISCLOSE A TALE TOTHRILL ALL CONNECTED WITH ME WITH HORROR. I WAS AWARE ALSO THAT ISHOULD OFTEN LOSE ALL SELFCOMMAND ALL CAPACITY OF HIDING THEHARROWING SENSATIONS THAT WOULD POSSESS ME DURING THE PROGRESS OF MYUNEARTHLY OCCUPATION. I MUST ABSENT MYSELF FROM ALL I LOVED WHILE THUSEMPLOYED. ONCE COMMENCED IT WOULD QUICKLY BE ACHIEVED AND I MIGHT BERESTORED TO MY FAMILY IN PEACE AND HAPPINESS. MY PROMISE FULFILLEDTHE MONSTER WOULD DEPART FOR EVER. OR SO MY FOND FANCY IMAGED SOMEACCIDENT MIGHT MEANWHILE OCCUR TO DESTROY HIM AND PUT AN END TO MYSLAVERY FOR EVER.THESE FEELINGS DICTATED MY ANSWER TO MY FATHER. I EXPRESSED A WISH TOVISIT ENGLAND BUT CONCEALING THE TRUE REASONS OF THIS REQUEST ICLOTHED MY DESIRES UNDER A GUISE WHICH EXCITED NO SUSPICION WHILE IURGED MY DESIRE WITH AN EARNESTNESS THAT EASILY INDUCED MY FATHER TOCOMPLY. AFTER SO LONG A PERIOD OF AN ABSORBING MELANCHOLY THATRESEMBLED MADNESS IN ITS INTENSITY AND EFFECTS HE WAS GLAD TO FINDTHAT I WAS CAPABLE OF TAKING PLEASURE IN THE IDEA OF SUCH A JOURNEYAND HE HOPED THAT CHANGE OF SCENE AND VARIED AMUSEMENT WOULD BEFORE MYRETURN HAVE RESTORED ME ENTIRELY TO MYSELF.THE DURATION OF MY ABSENCE WAS LEFT TO MY OWN CHOICE A FEW MONTHS ORAT MOST A YEAR WAS THE PERIOD CONTEMPLATED. ONE PATERNAL KINDPRECAUTION HE HAD TAKEN TO ENSURE MY HAVING A COMPANION. WITHOUTPREVIOUSLY COMMUNICATING WITH ME HE HAD IN CONCERT WITH ELIZABETHARRANGED THAT CLERVAL SHOULD JOIN ME AT STRASBURGH. THIS INTERFEREDWITH THE SOLITUDE I COVETED FOR THE PROSECUTION OF MY TASK YET AT THECOMMENCEMENT OF MY JOURNEY THE PRESENCE OF MY FRIEND COULD IN NO WAY BEAN IMPEDIMENT AND TRULY I REJOICED THAT THUS I SHOULD BE SAVED MANYHOURS OF LONELY MADDENING REFLECTION. NAY HENRY MIGHT STAND BETWEENME AND THE INTRUSION OF MY FOE. IF I WERE ALONE WOULD HE NOT AT TIMESFORCE HIS ABHORRED PRESENCE ON ME TO REMIND ME OF MY TASK OR TOCONTEMPLATE ITS PROGRESSTO ENGLAND THEREFORE I WAS BOUND AND IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT MY UNIONWITH ELIZABETH SHOULD TAKE PLACE IMMEDIATELY ON MY RETURN. MY FATHERSAGE RENDERED HIM EXTREMELY AVERSE TO DELAY. FOR MYSELF THERE WAS ONEREWARD I PROMISED MYSELF FROM MY DETESTED TOILSONE CONSOLATION FOR MYUNPARALLELED SUFFERINGS IT WAS THE PROSPECT OF THAT DAY WHENENFRANCHISED FROM MY MISERABLE SLAVERY I MIGHT CLAIM ELIZABETH ANDFORGET THE PAST IN MY UNION WITH HER.I NOW MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY JOURNEY BUT ONE FEELING HAUNTED MEWHICH FILLED ME WITH FEAR AND AGITATION. DURING MY ABSENCE I SHOULDLEAVE MY FRIENDS UNCONSCIOUS OF THE EXISTENCE OF THEIR ENEMY ANDUNPROTECTED FROM HIS ATTACKS EXASPERATED AS HE MIGHT BE BY MYDEPARTURE. BUT HE HAD PROMISED TO FOLLOW ME WHEREVER I MIGHT GO ANDWOULD HE NOT ACCOMPANY ME TO ENGLAND THIS IMAGINATION WAS DREADFUL INITSELF BUT SOOTHING INASMUCH AS IT SUPPOSED THE SAFETY OF MY FRIENDS.I WAS AGONISED WITH THE IDEA OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE REVERSE OFTHIS MIGHT HAPPEN. BUT THROUGH THE WHOLE PERIOD DURING WHICH I WAS THESLAVE OF MY CREATURE I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE GOVERNED BY THE IMPULSES OFTHE MOMENT AND MY PRESENT SENSATIONS STRONGLY INTIMATED THAT THE FIENDWOULD FOLLOW ME AND EXEMPT MY FAMILY FROM THE DANGER OF HISMACHINATIONS.IT WAS IN THE LATTER END OF SEPTEMBER THAT I AGAIN QUITTED MY NATIVECOUNTRY. MY JOURNEY HAD BEEN MY OWN SUGGESTION AND ELIZABETHTHEREFORE ACQUIESCED BUT SHE WAS FILLED WITH DISQUIET AT THE IDEA OFMY SUFFERING AWAY FROM HER THE INROADS OF MISERY AND GRIEF. IT HADBEEN HER CARE WHICH PROVIDED ME A COMPANION IN CLERVALAND YET A MANIS BLIND TO A THOUSAND MINUTE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH CALL FORTH A WOMANSSEDULOUS ATTENTION. SHE LONGED TO BID ME HASTEN MY RETURN A THOUSANDCONFLICTING EMOTIONS RENDERED HER MUTE AS SHE BADE ME A TEARFUL SILENTFAREWELL.I THREW MYSELF INTO THE CARRIAGE THAT WAS TO CONVEY ME AWAY HARDLYKNOWING WHITHER I WAS GOING AND CARELESS OF WHAT WAS PASSING AROUND.I REMEMBERED ONLY AND IT WAS WITH A BITTER ANGUISH THAT I REFLECTED ONIT TO ORDER THAT MY CHEMICAL INSTRUMENTS SHOULD BE PACKED TO GO WITHME. FILLED WITH DREARY IMAGINATIONS I PASSED THROUGH MANY BEAUTIFULAND MAJESTIC SCENES BUT MY EYES WERE FIXED AND UNOBSERVING. I COULDONLY THINK OF THE BOURNE OF MY TRAVELS AND THE WORK WHICH WAS TO OCCUPYME WHILST THEY ENDURED.AFTER SOME DAYS SPENT IN LISTLESS INDOLENCE DURING WHICH I TRAVERSEDMANY LEAGUES I ARRIVED AT STRASBURGH WHERE I WAITED TWO DAYS FORCLERVAL. HE CAME. ALAS HOW GREAT WAS THE CONTRAST BETWEEN US HEWAS ALIVE TO EVERY NEW SCENE JOYFUL WHEN HE SAW THE BEAUTIES OF THESETTING SUN AND MORE HAPPY WHEN HE BEHELD IT RISE AND RECOMMENCE A NEWDAY. HE POINTED OUT TO ME THE SHIFTING COLOURS OF THE LANDSCAPE ANDTHE APPEARANCES OF THE SKY. THIS IS WHAT IT IS TO LIVE HE CRIEDNOW I ENJOY EXISTENCE BUT YOU MY DEAR FRANKENSTEIN WHEREFORE AREYOU DESPONDING AND SORROWFUL IN TRUTH I WAS OCCUPIED BY GLOOMYTHOUGHTS AND NEITHER SAW THE DESCENT OF THE EVENING STAR NOR THE GOLDENSUNRISE REFLECTED IN THE RHINE. AND YOU MY FRIEND WOULD BE FAR MOREAMUSED WITH THE JOURNAL OF CLERVAL WHO OBSERVED THE SCENERY WITH ANEYE OF FEELING AND DELIGHT THAN IN LISTENING TO MY REFLECTIONS. I AMISERABLE WRETCH HAUNTED BY A CURSE THAT SHUT UP EVERY AVENUE TOENJOYMENT.WE HAD AGREED TO DESCEND THE RHINE IN A BOAT FROM STRASBURGH TOROTTERDAM WHENCE WE MIGHT TAKE SHIPPING FOR LONDON. DURING THISVOYAGE WE PASSED MANY WILLOWY ISLANDS AND SAW SEVERAL BEAUTIFUL TOWNS.WE STAYED A DAY AT MANNHEIM AND ON THE FIFTH FROM OUR DEPARTURE FROMSTRASBURGH ARRIVED AT MAINZ. THE COURSE OF THE RHINE BELOW MAINZBECOMES MUCH MORE PICTURESQUE. THE RIVER DESCENDS RAPIDLY AND WINDSBETWEEN HILLS NOT HIGH BUT STEEP AND OF BEAUTIFUL FORMS. WE SAWMANY RUINED CASTLES STANDING ON THE EDGES OF PRECIPICES SURROUNDED BYBLACK WOODS HIGH AND INACCESSIBLE. THIS PART OF THE RHINE INDEEDPRESENTS A SINGULARLY VARIEGATED LANDSCAPE. IN ONE SPOT YOU VIEWRUGGED HILLS RUINED CASTLES OVERLOOKING TREMENDOUS PRECIPICES WITHTHE DARK RHINE RUSHING BENEATH AND ON THE SUDDEN TURN OF A PROMONTORYFLOURISHING VINEYARDS WITH GREEN SLOPING BANKS AND A MEANDERING RIVERAND POPULOUS TOWNS OCCUPY THE SCENE.WE TRAVELLED AT THE TIME OF THE VINTAGE AND HEARD THE SONG OF THE LABOURERSAS WE GLIDED DOWN THE STREAM. EVEN I DEPRESSED IN MIND AND MY SPIRITSCONTINUALLY AGITATED BY GLOOMY FEELINGS EVEN I WAS PLEASED. I LAY AT THEBOTTOM OF THE BOAT AND AS I GAZED ON THE CLOUDLESS BLUE SKY I SEEMED TODRINK IN A TRANQUILLITY TO WHICH I HAD LONG BEEN A STRANGER. AND IF THESEWERE MY SENSATIONS WHO CAN DESCRIBE THOSE OF HENRY HE FELT AS IF HE HADBEEN TRANSPORTED TO FAIRYLAND AND ENJOYED A HAPPINESS SELDOM TASTED BYMAN. I HAVE SEEN HE SAID THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SCENESOF MY OWN COUNTRY I HAVE VISITED THE LAKES OF LUCERNE AND URI WHERE THESNOWY MOUNTAINS DESCEND ALMOST PERPENDICULARLY TO THE WATER CASTING BLACKAND IMPENETRABLE SHADES WHICH WOULD CAUSE A GLOOMY AND MOURNFUL APPEARANCEWERE IT NOT FOR THE MOST VERDANT ISLANDS THAT RELIEVE THE EYE BY THEIR GAYAPPEARANCE I HAVE SEEN THIS LAKE AGITATED BY A TEMPEST WHEN THE WIND TOREUP WHIRLWINDS OF WATER AND GAVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT THE WATERSPOUT MUST BEON THE GREAT OCEAN AND THE WAVES DASH WITH FURY THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAINWHERE THE PRIEST AND HIS MISTRESS WERE OVERWHELMED BY AN AVALANCHE ANDWHERE THEIR DYING VOICES ARE STILL SAID TO BE HEARD AMID THE PAUSES OF THENIGHTLY WIND I HAVE SEEN THE MOUNTAINS OF LA VALAIS AND THE PAYS DE VAUDBUT THIS COUNTRY VICTOR PLEASES ME MORE THAN ALL THOSE WONDERS. THEMOUNTAINS OF SWITZERLAND ARE MORE MAJESTIC AND STRANGE BUT THERE IS ACHARM IN THE BANKS OF THIS DIVINE RIVER THAT I NEVER BEFORE SAW EQUALLED.LOOK AT THAT CASTLE WHICH OVERHANGS YON PRECIPICE AND THAT ALSO ON THEISLAND ALMOST CONCEALED AMONGST THE FOLIAGE OF THOSE LOVELY TREES AND NOWTHAT GROUP OF LABOURERS COMING FROM AMONG THEIR VINES AND THAT VILLAGEHALF HID IN THE RECESS OF THE MOUNTAIN. OH SURELY THE SPIRIT THAT INHABITSAND GUARDS THIS PLACE HAS A SOUL MORE IN HARMONY WITH MAN THAN THOSE WHOPILE THE GLACIER OR RETIRE TO THE INACCESSIBLE PEAKS OF THE MOUNTAINS OFOUR OWN COUNTRY.CLERVAL BELOVED FRIEND EVEN NOW IT DELIGHTS ME TO RECORD YOUR WORDS ANDTO DWELL ON THE PRAISE OF WHICH YOU ARE SO EMINENTLY DESERVING. HE WAS ABEING FORMED IN THE VERY POETRY OF NATURE. HIS WILD ANDENTHUSIASTIC IMAGINATION WAS CHASTENED BY THE SENSIBILITY OF HIS HEART. HISSOUL OVERFLOWED WITH ARDENT AFFECTIONS AND HIS FRIENDSHIP WAS OF THATDEVOTED AND WONDROUS NATURE THAT THE WORLDLYMINDED TEACH US TO LOOK FOR ONLYIN THE IMAGINATION. BUT EVEN HUMAN SYMPATHIES WERE NOT SUFFICIENT TOSATISFY HIS EAGER MIND. THE SCENERY OF EXTERNAL NATURE WHICH OTHERS REGARDONLY WITH ADMIRATION HE LOVED WITH ARDOUR    THE SOUNDING CATARACT    HAUNTED HIM LIKE A PASSION THE TALL ROCK    THE MOUNTAIN AND THE DEEP AND GLOOMY WOOD    THEIR COLOURS AND THEIR FORMS WERE THEN TO HIM    AN APPETITE A FEELING AND A LOVE    THAT HAD NO NEED OF A REMOTER CHARM    BY THOUGHT SUPPLIED OR ANY INTEREST    UNBORROWD FROM THE EYE.          WORDSWORTHS TINTERN ABBEY.AND WHERE DOES HE NOW EXIST IS THIS GENTLE AND LOVELY BEING LOSTFOR EVER HAS THIS MIND SO REPLETE WITH IDEAS IMAGINATIONS FANCIFULAND MAGNIFICENT WHICH FORMED A WORLD WHOSE EXISTENCE DEPENDED ON THELIFE OF ITS CREATORHAS THIS MIND PERISHED DOES IT NOW ONLY EXISTIN MY MEMORY NO IT IS NOT THUS YOUR FORM SO DIVINELY WROUGHT ANDBEAMING WITH BEAUTY HAS DECAYED BUT YOUR SPIRIT STILL VISITS ANDCONSOLES YOUR UNHAPPY FRIEND.PARDON THIS GUSH OF SORROW THESE INEFFECTUAL WORDS ARE BUT A SLIGHTTRIBUTE TO THE UNEXAMPLED WORTH OF HENRY BUT THEY SOOTHE MY HEARTOVERFLOWING WITH THE ANGUISH WHICH HIS REMEMBRANCE CREATES. I WILLPROCEED WITH MY TALE.BEYOND COLOGNE WE DESCENDED TO THE PLAINS OF HOLLAND AND WE RESOLVED TOPOST THE REMAINDER OF OUR WAY FOR THE WIND WAS CONTRARY AND THE STREAM OFTHE RIVER WAS TOO GENTLE TO AID US.OUR JOURNEY HERE LOST THE INTEREST ARISING FROM BEAUTIFUL SCENERY BUT WEARRIVED IN A FEW DAYS AT ROTTERDAM WHENCE WE PROCEEDED BY SEA TO ENGLAND.IT WAS ON A CLEAR MORNING IN THE LATTER DAYS OF DECEMBER THAT I FIRST SAWTHE WHITE CLIFFS OF BRITAIN. THE BANKS OF THE THAMES PRESENTED A NEW SCENETHEY WERE FLAT BUT FERTILE AND ALMOST EVERY TOWN WAS MARKED BY THEREMEMBRANCE OF SOME STORY. WE SAW TILBURY FORT AND REMEMBERED THE SPANISHARMADA GRAVESEND WOOLWICH AND GREENWICHPLACES WHICH I HAD HEARDOF EVEN IN MY COUNTRY.AT LENGTH WE SAW THE NUMEROUS STEEPLES OF LONDON ST. PAULS TOWERINGABOVE ALL AND THE TOWER FAMED IN ENGLISH HISTORY.CHAPTER LONDON WAS OUR PRESENT POINT OF REST WE DETERMINED TO REMAIN SEVERALMONTHS IN THIS WONDERFUL AND CELEBRATED CITY. CLERVAL DESIRED THEINTERCOURSE OF THE MEN OF GENIUS AND TALENT WHO FLOURISHED AT THISTIME BUT THIS WAS WITH ME A SECONDARY OBJECT I WAS PRINCIPALLYOCCUPIED WITH THE MEANS OF OBTAINING THE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR THECOMPLETION OF MY PROMISE AND QUICKLY AVAILED MYSELF OF THE LETTERS OFINTRODUCTION THAT I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME ADDRESSED TO THE MOSTDISTINGUISHED NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS.IF THIS JOURNEY HAD TAKEN PLACE DURING MY DAYS OF STUDY AND HAPPINESSIT WOULD HAVE AFFORDED ME INEXPRESSIBLE PLEASURE. BUT A BLIGHT HADCOME OVER MY EXISTENCE AND I ONLY VISITED THESE PEOPLE FOR THE SAKE OFTHE INFORMATION THEY MIGHT GIVE ME ON THE SUBJECT IN WHICH MY INTERESTWAS SO TERRIBLY PROFOUND. COMPANY WAS IRKSOME TO ME WHEN ALONE ICOULD FILL MY MIND WITH THE SIGHTS OF HEAVEN AND EARTH THE VOICE OFHENRY SOOTHED ME AND I COULD THUS CHEAT MYSELF INTO A TRANSITORYPEACE. BUT BUSY UNINTERESTING JOYOUS FACES BROUGHT BACK DESPAIR TOMY HEART. I SAW AN INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER PLACED BETWEEN ME AND MYFELLOW MEN THIS BARRIER WAS SEALED WITH THE BLOOD OF WILLIAM ANDJUSTINE AND TO REFLECT ON THE EVENTS CONNECTED WITH THOSE NAMES FILLEDMY SOUL WITH ANGUISH.BUT IN CLERVAL I SAW THE IMAGE OF MY FORMER SELF HE WAS INQUISITIVEAND ANXIOUS TO GAIN EXPERIENCE AND INSTRUCTION. THE DIFFERENCE OFMANNERS WHICH HE OBSERVED WAS TO HIM AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OFINSTRUCTION AND AMUSEMENT. HE WAS ALSO PURSUING AN OBJECT HE HAD LONGHAD IN VIEW. HIS DESIGN WAS TO VISIT INDIA IN THE BELIEF THAT HE HADIN HIS KNOWLEDGE OF ITS VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND IN THE VIEWS HE HADTAKEN OF ITS SOCIETY THE MEANS OF MATERIALLY ASSISTING THE PROGRESS OFEUROPEAN COLONIZATION AND TRADE. IN BRITAIN ONLY COULD HE FURTHER THEEXECUTION OF HIS PLAN. HE WAS FOR EVER BUSY AND THE ONLY CHECK TO HISENJOYMENTS WAS MY SORROWFUL AND DEJECTED MIND. I TRIED TO CONCEAL THISAS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT NOT DEBAR HIM FROM THE PLEASURESNATURAL TO ONE WHO WAS ENTERING ON A NEW SCENE OF LIFE UNDISTURBED BYANY CARE OR BITTER RECOLLECTION. I OFTEN REFUSED TO ACCOMPANY HIMALLEGING ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT THAT I MIGHT REMAIN ALONE. I NOW ALSOBEGAN TO COLLECT THE MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR MY NEW CREATION AND THISWAS TO ME LIKE THE TORTURE OF SINGLE DROPS OF WATER CONTINUALLY FALLINGON THE HEAD. EVERY THOUGHT THAT WAS DEVOTED TO IT WAS AN EXTREMEANGUISH AND EVERY WORD THAT I SPOKE IN ALLUSION TO IT CAUSED MY LIPSTO QUIVER AND MY HEART TO PALPITATE.AFTER PASSING SOME MONTHS IN LONDON WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A PERSON INSCOTLAND WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN OUR VISITOR AT GENEVA. HE MENTIONED THEBEAUTIES OF HIS NATIVE COUNTRY AND ASKED US IF THOSE WERE NOT SUFFICIENTALLUREMENTS TO INDUCE US TO PROLONG OUR JOURNEY AS FAR NORTH AS PERTHWHERE HE RESIDED. CLERVAL EAGERLY DESIRED TO ACCEPT THIS INVITATION AND IALTHOUGH I ABHORRED SOCIETY WISHED TO VIEW AGAIN MOUNTAINS AND STREAMS ANDALL THE WONDROUS WORKS WITH WHICH NATURE ADORNS HER CHOSEN DWELLINGPLACES.WE HAD ARRIVED IN ENGLAND AT THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER AND IT WAS NOWFEBRUARY. WE ACCORDINGLY DETERMINED TO COMMENCE OUR JOURNEY TOWARDS THENORTH AT THE EXPIRATION OF ANOTHER MONTH. IN THIS EXPEDITION WE DID NOTINTEND TO FOLLOW THE GREAT ROAD TO EDINBURGH BUT TO VISIT WINDSOR OXFORDMATLOCK AND THE CUMBERLAND LAKES RESOLVING TO ARRIVE AT THE COMPLETION OFTHIS TOUR ABOUT THE END OF JULY. I PACKED UP MY CHEMICAL INSTRUMENTS ANDTHE MATERIALS I HAD COLLECTED RESOLVING TO FINISH MY LABOURS IN SOMEOBSCURE NOOK IN THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND.WE QUITTED LONDON ON THE TH OF MARCH AND REMAINED A FEW DAYS ATWINDSOR RAMBLING IN ITS BEAUTIFUL FOREST. THIS WAS A NEW SCENE TO USMOUNTAINEERS THE MAJESTIC OAKS THE QUANTITY OF GAME AND THE HERDS OFSTATELY DEER WERE ALL NOVELTIES TO US.FROM THENCE WE PROCEEDED TO OXFORD. AS WE ENTERED THIS CITY OUR MINDSWERE FILLED WITH THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE EVENTS THAT HAD BEEN TRANSACTEDTHERE MORE THAN A CENTURY AND A HALF BEFORE. IT WAS HERE THAT CHARLESI. HAD COLLECTED HIS FORCES. THIS CITY HAD REMAINED FAITHFUL TO HIMAFTER THE WHOLE NATION HAD FORSAKEN HIS CAUSE TO JOIN THE STANDARD OFPARLIAMENT AND LIBERTY. THE MEMORY OF THAT UNFORTUNATE KING AND HISCOMPANIONS THE AMIABLE FALKLAND THE INSOLENT GORING HIS QUEEN ANDSON GAVE A PECULIAR INTEREST TO EVERY PART OF THE CITY WHICH THEYMIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE INHABITED. THE SPIRIT OF ELDER DAYS FOUND ADWELLING HERE AND WE DELIGHTED TO TRACE ITS FOOTSTEPS. IF THESEFEELINGS HAD NOT FOUND AN IMAGINARY GRATIFICATION THE APPEARANCE OFTHE CITY HAD YET IN ITSELF SUFFICIENT BEAUTY TO OBTAIN OUR ADMIRATION.THE COLLEGES ARE ANCIENT AND PICTURESQUE THE STREETS ARE ALMOSTMAGNIFICENT AND THE LOVELY ISIS WHICH FLOWS BESIDE IT THROUGH MEADOWSOF EXQUISITE VERDURE IS SPREAD FORTH INTO A PLACID EXPANSE OF WATERSWHICH REFLECTS ITS MAJESTIC ASSEMBLAGE OF TOWERS AND SPIRES ANDDOMES EMBOSOMED AMONG AGED TREES.I ENJOYED THIS SCENE AND YET MY ENJOYMENT WAS EMBITTERED BOTH BY THEMEMORY OF THE PAST AND THE ANTICIPATION OF THE FUTURE. I WAS FORMEDFOR PEACEFUL HAPPINESS. DURING MY YOUTHFUL DAYS DISCONTENT NEVERVISITED MY MIND AND IF I WAS EVER OVERCOME BY ENNUI THE SIGHT OF WHATIS BEAUTIFUL IN NATURE OR THE STUDY OF WHAT IS EXCELLENT AND SUBLIME INTHE PRODUCTIONS OF MAN COULD ALWAYS INTEREST MY HEART AND COMMUNICATEELASTICITY TO MY SPIRITS. BUT I AM A BLASTED TREE THE BOLT HASENTERED MY SOUL AND I FELT THEN THAT I SHOULD SURVIVE TO EXHIBIT WHATI SHALL SOON CEASE TO BEA MISERABLE SPECTACLE OF WRECKED HUMANITYPITIABLE TO OTHERS AND INTOLERABLE TO MYSELF.WE PASSED A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD AT OXFORD RAMBLING AMONG ITS ENVIRONSAND ENDEAVOURING TO IDENTIFY EVERY SPOT WHICH MIGHT RELATE TO THE MOSTANIMATING EPOCH OF ENGLISH HISTORY. OUR LITTLE VOYAGES OF DISCOVERYWERE OFTEN PROLONGED BY THE SUCCESSIVE OBJECTS THAT PRESENTEDTHEMSELVES. WE VISITED THE TOMB OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS HAMPDEN AND THEFIELD ON WHICH THAT PATRIOT FELL. FOR A MOMENT MY SOUL WAS ELEVATEDFROM ITS DEBASING AND MISERABLE FEARS TO CONTEMPLATE THE DIVINE IDEASOF LIBERTY AND SELFSACRIFICE OF WHICH THESE SIGHTS WERE THE MONUMENTSAND THE REMEMBRANCERS. FOR AN INSTANT I DARED TO SHAKE OFF MY CHAINSAND LOOK AROUND ME WITH A FREE AND LOFTY SPIRIT BUT THE IRON HAD EATENINTO MY FLESH AND I SANK AGAIN TREMBLING AND HOPELESS INTO MYMISERABLE SELF.WE LEFT OXFORD WITH REGRET AND PROCEEDED TO MATLOCK WHICH WAS OUR NEXTPLACE OF REST. THE COUNTRY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THIS VILLAGERESEMBLED TO A GREATER DEGREE THE SCENERY OF SWITZERLAND BUTEVERYTHING IS ON A LOWER SCALE AND THE GREEN HILLS WANT THE CROWN OFDISTANT WHITE ALPS WHICH ALWAYS ATTEND ON THE PINY MOUNTAINS OF MYNATIVE COUNTRY. WE VISITED THE WONDROUS CAVE AND THE LITTLE CABINETSOF NATURAL HISTORY WHERE THE CURIOSITIES ARE DISPOSED IN THE SAMEMANNER AS IN THE COLLECTIONS AT SERVOX AND CHAMOUNIX. THE LATTER NAMEMADE ME TREMBLE WHEN PRONOUNCED BY HENRY AND I HASTENED TO QUITMATLOCK WITH WHICH THAT TERRIBLE SCENE WAS THUS ASSOCIATED.FROM DERBY STILL JOURNEYING NORTHWARDS WE PASSED TWO MONTHS INCUMBERLAND AND WESTMORLAND. I COULD NOW ALMOST FANCY MYSELF AMONG THESWISS MOUNTAINS. THE LITTLE PATCHES OF SNOW WHICH YET LINGERED ON THENORTHERN SIDES OF THE MOUNTAINS THE LAKES AND THE DASHING OF THEROCKY STREAMS WERE ALL FAMILIAR AND DEAR SIGHTS TO ME. HERE ALSO WEMADE SOME ACQUAINTANCES WHO ALMOST CONTRIVED TO CHEAT ME INTOHAPPINESS. THE DELIGHT OF CLERVAL WAS PROPORTIONABLY GREATER THANMINE HIS MIND EXPANDED IN THE COMPANY OF MEN OF TALENT AND HE FOUNDIN HIS OWN NATURE GREATER CAPACITIES AND RESOURCES THAN HE COULD HAVEIMAGINED HIMSELF TO HAVE POSSESSED WHILE HE ASSOCIATED WITH HISINFERIORS. I COULD PASS MY LIFE HERE SAID HE TO ME AND AMONGTHESE MOUNTAINS I SHOULD SCARCELY REGRET SWITZERLAND AND THE RHINE.BUT HE FOUND THAT A TRAVELLERS LIFE IS ONE THAT INCLUDES MUCH PAINAMIDST ITS ENJOYMENTS. HIS FEELINGS ARE FOR EVER ON THE STRETCH ANDWHEN HE BEGINS TO SINK INTO REPOSE HE FINDS HIMSELF OBLIGED TO QUITTHAT ON WHICH HE RESTS IN PLEASURE FOR SOMETHING NEW WHICH AGAINENGAGES HIS ATTENTION AND WHICH ALSO HE FORSAKES FOR OTHER NOVELTIES.WE HAD SCARCELY VISITED THE VARIOUS LAKES OF CUMBERLAND AND WESTMORLANDAND CONCEIVED AN AFFECTION FOR SOME OF THE INHABITANTS WHEN THE PERIODOF OUR APPOINTMENT WITH OUR SCOTCH FRIEND APPROACHED AND WE LEFT THEMTO TRAVEL ON. FOR MY OWN PART I WAS NOT SORRY. I HAD NOW NEGLECTED MYPROMISE FOR SOME TIME AND I FEARED THE EFFECTS OF THE DMONSDISAPPOINTMENT. HE MIGHT REMAIN IN SWITZERLAND AND WREAK HIS VENGEANCEON MY RELATIVES. THIS IDEA PURSUED ME AND TORMENTED ME AT EVERY MOMENTFROM WHICH I MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE SNATCHED REPOSE AND PEACE. I WAITEDFOR MY LETTERS WITH FEVERISH IMPATIENCE IF THEY WERE DELAYED I WASMISERABLE AND OVERCOME BY A THOUSAND FEARS AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND ISAW THE SUPERSCRIPTION OF ELIZABETH OR MY FATHER I HARDLY DARED TOREAD AND ASCERTAIN MY FATE. SOMETIMES I THOUGHT THAT THE FIENDFOLLOWED ME AND MIGHT EXPEDITE MY REMISSNESS BY MURDERING MY COMPANION.WHEN THESE THOUGHTS POSSESSED ME I WOULD NOT QUIT HENRY FOR A MOMENTBUT FOLLOWED HIM AS HIS SHADOW TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE FANCIED RAGE OFHIS DESTROYER. I FELT AS IF I HAD COMMITTED SOME GREAT CRIME THECONSCIOUSNESS OF WHICH HAUNTED ME. I WAS GUILTLESS BUT I HAD INDEEDDRAWN DOWN A HORRIBLE CURSE UPON MY HEAD AS MORTAL AS THAT OF CRIME.I VISITED EDINBURGH WITH LANGUID EYES AND MIND AND YET THAT CITY MIGHTHAVE INTERESTED THE MOST UNFORTUNATE BEING. CLERVAL DID NOT LIKE IT SO WELLAS OXFORD FOR THE ANTIQUITY OF THE LATTER CITY WAS MORE PLEASING TO HIM.BUT THE BEAUTY AND REGULARITY OF THE NEW TOWN OF EDINBURGH ITS ROMANTICCASTLE AND ITS ENVIRONS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL IN THE WORLD ARTHURSSEAT ST. BERNARDS WELL AND THE PENTLAND HILLS COMPENSATED HIM FORTHE CHANGE AND FILLED HIM WITH CHEERFULNESS AND ADMIRATION. BUT I WASIMPATIENT TO ARRIVE AT THE TERMINATION OF MY JOURNEY.WE LEFT EDINBURGH IN A WEEK PASSING THROUGH COUPAR ST. ANDREWS ANDALONG THE BANKS OF THE TAY TO PERTH WHERE OUR FRIEND EXPECTED US.BUT I WAS IN NO MOOD TO LAUGH AND TALK WITH STRANGERS OR ENTER INTOTHEIR FEELINGS OR PLANS WITH THE GOOD HUMOUR EXPECTED FROM A GUEST ANDACCORDINGLY I TOLD CLERVAL THAT I WISHED TO MAKE THE TOUR OF SCOTLANDALONE. DO YOU SAID I ENJOY YOURSELF AND LET THIS BE OURRENDEZVOUS. I MAY BE ABSENT A MONTH OR TWO BUT DO NOT INTERFERE WITHMY MOTIONS I ENTREAT YOU LEAVE ME TO PEACE AND SOLITUDE FOR A SHORTTIME AND WHEN I RETURN I HOPE IT WILL BE WITH A LIGHTER HEART MORECONGENIAL TO YOUR OWN TEMPER.HENRY WISHED TO DISSUADE ME BUT SEEING ME BENT ON THIS PLAN CEASED TOREMONSTRATE. HE ENTREATED ME TO WRITE OFTEN. I HAD RATHER BE WITHYOU HE SAID IN YOUR SOLITARY RAMBLES THAN WITH THESE SCOTCHPEOPLE WHOM I DO NOT KNOW HASTEN THEN MY DEAR FRIEND TO RETURNTHAT I MAY AGAIN FEEL MYSELF SOMEWHAT AT HOME WHICH I CANNOT DO INYOUR ABSENCE.HAVING PARTED FROM MY FRIEND I DETERMINED TO VISIT SOME REMOTE SPOT OFSCOTLAND AND FINISH MY WORK IN SOLITUDE. I DID NOT DOUBT BUT THAT THEMONSTER FOLLOWED ME AND WOULD DISCOVER HIMSELF TO ME WHEN I SHOULD HAVEFINISHED THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE HIS COMPANION.WITH THIS RESOLUTION I TRAVERSED THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS AND FIXED ON ONE OFTHE REMOTEST OF THE ORKNEYS AS THE SCENE OF MY LABOURS. IT WAS A PLACEFITTED FOR SUCH A WORK BEING HARDLY MORE THAN A ROCK WHOSE HIGH SIDES WERECONTINUALLY BEATEN UPON BY THE WAVES. THE SOIL WAS BARREN SCARCELYAFFORDING PASTURE FOR A FEW MISERABLE COWS AND OATMEAL FOR ITSINHABITANTS WHICH CONSISTED OF FIVE PERSONS WHOSE GAUNT AND SCRAGGY LIMBSGAVE TOKENS OF THEIR MISERABLE FARE. VEGETABLES AND BREAD WHEN THEYINDULGED IN SUCH LUXURIES AND EVEN FRESH WATER WAS TO BE PROCURED FROMTHE MAINLAND WHICH WAS ABOUT FIVE MILES DISTANT.ON THE WHOLE ISLAND THERE WERE BUT THREE MISERABLE HUTS AND ONE OFTHESE WAS VACANT WHEN I ARRIVED. THIS I HIRED. IT CONTAINED BUT TWOROOMS AND THESE EXHIBITED ALL THE SQUALIDNESS OF THE MOST MISERABLEPENURY. THE THATCH HAD FALLEN IN THE WALLS WERE UNPLASTERED AND THEDOOR WAS OFF ITS HINGES. I ORDERED IT TO BE REPAIRED BOUGHT SOMEFURNITURE AND TOOK POSSESSION AN INCIDENT WHICH WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVEOCCASIONED SOME SURPRISE HAD NOT ALL THE SENSES OF THE COTTAGERS BEENBENUMBED BY WANT AND SQUALID POVERTY. AS IT WAS I LIVED UNGAZED ATAND UNMOLESTED HARDLY THANKED FOR THE PITTANCE OF FOOD AND CLOTHESWHICH I GAVE SO MUCH DOES SUFFERING BLUNT EVEN THE COARSEST SENSATIONSOF MEN.IN THIS RETREAT I DEVOTED THE MORNING TO LABOUR BUT IN THE EVENINGWHEN THE WEATHER PERMITTED I WALKED ON THE STONY BEACH OF THE SEA TOLISTEN TO THE WAVES AS THEY ROARED AND DASHED AT MY FEET. IT WAS AMONOTONOUS YET EVERCHANGING SCENE. I THOUGHT OF SWITZERLAND IT WASFAR DIFFERENT FROM THIS DESOLATE AND APPALLING LANDSCAPE. ITS HILLSARE COVERED WITH VINES AND ITS COTTAGES ARE SCATTERED THICKLY IN THEPLAINS. ITS FAIR LAKES REFLECT A BLUE AND GENTLE SKY AND WHENTROUBLED BY THE WINDS THEIR TUMULT IS BUT AS THE PLAY OF A LIVELYINFANT WHEN COMPARED TO THE ROARINGS OF THE GIANT OCEAN.IN THIS MANNER I DISTRIBUTED MY OCCUPATIONS WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED BUTAS I PROCEEDED IN MY LABOUR IT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE HORRIBLE ANDIRKSOME TO ME. SOMETIMES I COULD NOT PREVAIL ON MYSELF TO ENTER MYLABORATORY FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND AT OTHER TIMES I TOILED DAY AND NIGHTIN ORDER TO COMPLETE MY WORK. IT WAS INDEED A FILTHY PROCESS INWHICH I WAS ENGAGED. DURING MY FIRST EXPERIMENT A KIND OFENTHUSIASTIC FRENZY HAD BLINDED ME TO THE HORROR OF MY EMPLOYMENT MYMIND WAS INTENTLY FIXED ON THE CONSUMMATION OF MY LABOUR AND MY EYESWERE SHUT TO THE HORROR OF MY PROCEEDINGS. BUT NOW I WENT TO IT INCOLD BLOOD AND MY HEART OFTEN SICKENED AT THE WORK OF MY HANDS.THUS SITUATED EMPLOYED IN THE MOST DETESTABLE OCCUPATION IMMERSED INA SOLITUDE WHERE NOTHING COULD FOR AN INSTANT CALL MY ATTENTION FROMTHE ACTUAL SCENE IN WHICH I WAS ENGAGED MY SPIRITS BECAME UNEQUAL IGREW RESTLESS AND NERVOUS. EVERY MOMENT I FEARED TO MEET MYPERSECUTOR. SOMETIMES I SAT WITH MY EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND FEARINGTO RAISE THEM LEST THEY SHOULD ENCOUNTER THE OBJECT WHICH I SO MUCHDREADED TO BEHOLD. I FEARED TO WANDER FROM THE SIGHT OF MY FELLOWCREATURES LEST WHEN ALONE HE SHOULD COME TO CLAIM HIS COMPANION.IN THE MEAN TIME I WORKED ON AND MY LABOUR WAS ALREADY CONSIDERABLYADVANCED. I LOOKED TOWARDS ITS COMPLETION WITH A TREMULOUS AND EAGERHOPE WHICH I DARED NOT TRUST MYSELF TO QUESTION BUT WHICH WASINTERMIXED WITH OBSCURE FOREBODINGS OF EVIL THAT MADE MY HEART SICKENIN MY BOSOM.CHAPTER I SAT ONE EVENING IN MY LABORATORY THE SUN HAD SET AND THE MOON WAS JUSTRISING FROM THE SEA I HAD NOT SUFFICIENT LIGHT FOR MY EMPLOYMENT AND IREMAINED IDLE IN A PAUSE OF CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER I SHOULD LEAVE MYLABOUR FOR THE NIGHT OR HASTEN ITS CONCLUSION BY AN UNREMITTING ATTENTIONTO IT. AS I SAT A TRAIN OF REFLECTION OCCURRED TO ME WHICH LED ME TOCONSIDER THE EFFECTS OF WHAT I WAS NOW DOING. THREE YEARS BEFORE I WASENGAGED IN THE SAME MANNER AND HAD CREATED A FIEND WHOSE UNPARALLELEDBARBARITY HAD DESOLATED MY HEART AND FILLED IT FOR EVER WITH THE BITTERESTREMORSE. I WAS NOW ABOUT TO FORM ANOTHER BEING OF WHOSE DISPOSITIONS I WASALIKE IGNORANT SHE MIGHT BECOME TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE MALIGNANT THAN HERMATE AND DELIGHT FOR ITS OWN SAKE IN MURDER AND WRETCHEDNESS. HE HADSWORN TO QUIT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AND HIDE HIMSELF IN DESERTS BUT SHEHAD NOT AND SHE WHO IN ALL PROBABILITY WAS TO BECOME A THINKING ANDREASONING ANIMAL MIGHT REFUSE TO COMPLY WITH A COMPACT MADE BEFORE HERCREATION. THEY MIGHT EVEN HATE EACH OTHER THE CREATURE WHO ALREADY LIVEDLOATHED HIS OWN DEFORMITY AND MIGHT HE NOT CONCEIVE A GREATER ABHORRENCEFOR IT WHEN IT CAME BEFORE HIS EYES IN THE FEMALE FORM SHE ALSO MIGHT TURNWITH DISGUST FROM HIM TO THE SUPERIOR BEAUTY OF MAN SHE MIGHT QUIT HIMAND HE BE AGAIN ALONE EXASPERATED BY THE FRESH PROVOCATION OF BEINGDESERTED BY ONE OF HIS OWN SPECIES.EVEN IF THEY WERE TO LEAVE EUROPE AND INHABIT THE DESERTS OF THE NEW WORLDYET ONE OF THE FIRST RESULTS OF THOSE SYMPATHIES FOR WHICH THE DMONTHIRSTED WOULD BE CHILDREN AND A RACE OF DEVILS WOULD BE PROPAGATED UPONTHE EARTH WHO MIGHT MAKE THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE SPECIES OF MAN ACONDITION PRECARIOUS AND FULL OF TERROR. HAD I RIGHT FOR MY OWN BENEFITTO INFLICT THIS CURSE UPON EVERLASTING GENERATIONS I HAD BEFORE BEEN MOVEDBY THE SOPHISMS OF THE BEING I HAD CREATED I HAD BEEN STRUCK SENSELESS BYHIS FIENDISH THREATS BUT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THE WICKEDNESS OF MYPROMISE BURST UPON ME I SHUDDERED TO THINK THAT FUTURE AGES MIGHT CURSE MEAS THEIR PEST WHOSE SELFISHNESS HAD NOT HESITATED TO BUY ITS OWN PEACE ATTHE PRICE PERHAPS OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE.I TREMBLED AND MY HEART FAILED WITHIN ME WHEN ON LOOKING UP I SAW BYTHE LIGHT OF THE MOON THE DMON AT THE CASEMENT. A GHASTLY GRINWRINKLED HIS LIPS AS HE GAZED ON ME WHERE I SAT FULFILLING THE TASKWHICH HE HAD ALLOTTED TO ME. YES HE HAD FOLLOWED ME IN MY TRAVELS HEHAD LOITERED IN FORESTS HID HIMSELF IN CAVES OR TAKEN REFUGE IN WIDEAND DESERT HEATHS AND HE NOW CAME TO MARK MY PROGRESS AND CLAIM THEFULFILMENT OF MY PROMISE.AS I LOOKED ON HIM HIS COUNTENANCE EXPRESSED THE UTMOST EXTENT OFMALICE AND TREACHERY. I THOUGHT WITH A SENSATION OF MADNESS ON MYPROMISE OF CREATING ANOTHER LIKE TO HIM AND TREMBLING WITH PASSIONTORE TO PIECES THE THING ON WHICH I WAS ENGAGED. THE WRETCH SAW MEDESTROY THE CREATURE ON WHOSE FUTURE EXISTENCE HE DEPENDED FORHAPPINESS AND WITH A HOWL OF DEVILISH DESPAIR AND REVENGE WITHDREW.I LEFT THE ROOM AND LOCKING THE DOOR MADE A SOLEMN VOW IN MY OWNHEART NEVER TO RESUME MY LABOURS AND THEN WITH TREMBLING STEPS ISOUGHT MY OWN APARTMENT. I WAS ALONE NONE WERE NEAR ME TO DISSIPATETHE GLOOM AND RELIEVE ME FROM THE SICKENING OPPRESSION OF THE MOSTTERRIBLE REVERIES.SEVERAL HOURS PASSED AND I REMAINED NEAR MY WINDOW GAZING ON THE SEAIT WAS ALMOST MOTIONLESS FOR THE WINDS WERE HUSHED AND ALL NATUREREPOSED UNDER THE EYE OF THE QUIET MOON. A FEW FISHING VESSELS ALONESPECKED THE WATER AND NOW AND THEN THE GENTLE BREEZE WAFTED THE SOUNDOF VOICES AS THE FISHERMEN CALLED TO ONE ANOTHER. I FELT THE SILENCEALTHOUGH I WAS HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF ITS EXTREME PROFUNDITY UNTIL MY EARWAS SUDDENLY ARRESTED BY THE PADDLING OF OARS NEAR THE SHORE AND APERSON LANDED CLOSE TO MY HOUSE.IN A FEW MINUTES AFTER I HEARD THE CREAKING OF MY DOOR AS IF SOME ONEENDEAVOURED TO OPEN IT SOFTLY. I TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT I FELT APRESENTIMENT OF WHO IT WAS AND WISHED TO ROUSE ONE OF THE PEASANTS WHODWELT IN A COTTAGE NOT FAR FROM MINE BUT I WAS OVERCOME BY THE SENSATIONOF HELPLESSNESS SO OFTEN FELT IN FRIGHTFUL DREAMS WHEN YOU IN VAINENDEAVOUR TO FLY FROM AN IMPENDING DANGER AND WAS ROOTED TO THE SPOT.PRESENTLY I HEARD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ALONG THE PASSAGE THE DOOROPENED AND THE WRETCH WHOM I DREADED APPEARED. SHUTTING THE DOOR HEAPPROACHED ME AND SAID IN A SMOTHERED VOICEYOU HAVE DESTROYED THE WORK WHICH YOU BEGAN WHAT IS IT THAT YOUINTEND DO YOU DARE TO BREAK YOUR PROMISE I HAVE ENDURED TOIL AND MISERYI LEFT SWITZERLAND WITH YOU I CREPT ALONG THE SHORES OF THE RHINE AMONGITS WILLOW ISLANDS AND OVER THE SUMMITS OF ITS HILLS. I HAVE DWELT MANYMONTHS IN THE HEATHS OF ENGLAND AND AMONG THE DESERTS OF SCOTLAND. I HAVEENDURED INCALCULABLE FATIGUE AND COLD AND HUNGER DO YOU DARE DESTROY MYHOPESBEGONE I DO BREAK MY PROMISE NEVER WILL I CREATE ANOTHER LIKEYOURSELF EQUAL IN DEFORMITY AND WICKEDNESS.SLAVE I BEFORE REASONED WITH YOU BUT YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELFUNWORTHY OF MY CONDESCENSION. REMEMBER THAT I HAVE POWER YOU BELIEVEYOURSELF MISERABLE BUT I CAN MAKE YOU SO WRETCHED THAT THE LIGHT OFDAY WILL BE HATEFUL TO YOU. YOU ARE MY CREATOR BUT I AM YOUR MASTEROBEYTHE HOUR OF MY IRRESOLUTION IS PAST AND THE PERIOD OF YOUR POWER ISARRIVED. YOUR THREATS CANNOT MOVE ME TO DO AN ACT OF WICKEDNESS BUTTHEY CONFIRM ME IN A DETERMINATION OF NOT CREATING YOU A COMPANION INVICE. SHALL I IN COOL BLOOD SET LOOSE UPON THE EARTH A DMON WHOSEDELIGHT IS IN DEATH AND WRETCHEDNESS BEGONE I AM FIRM AND YOURWORDS WILL ONLY EXASPERATE MY RAGE.THE MONSTER SAW MY DETERMINATION IN MY FACE AND GNASHED HIS TEETH IN THEIMPOTENCE OF ANGER. SHALL EACH MAN CRIED HE FIND AWIFE FOR HIS BOSOM AND EACH BEAST HAVE HIS MATE AND I BE ALONE I HADFEELINGS OF AFFECTION AND THEY WERE REQUITED BY DETESTATION AND SCORN.MAN YOU MAY HATE BUT BEWARE YOUR HOURS WILL PASS IN DREAD AND MISERYAND SOON THE BOLT WILL FALL WHICH MUST RAVISH FROM YOU YOUR HAPPINESS FOREVER. ARE YOU TO BE HAPPY WHILE I GROVEL IN THE INTENSITY OF MYWRETCHEDNESS YOU CAN BLAST MY OTHER PASSIONS BUT REVENGEREMAINSREVENGE HENCEFORTH DEARER THAN LIGHT OR FOOD I MAY DIE BUTFIRST YOU MY TYRANT AND TORMENTOR SHALL CURSE THE SUN THAT GAZES ON YOURMISERY. BEWARE FOR I AM FEARLESS AND THEREFORE POWERFUL. I WILL WATCH WITHTHE WILINESS OF A SNAKE THAT I MAY STING WITH ITS VENOM. MAN YOU SHALLREPENT OF THE INJURIES YOU INFLICT.DEVIL CEASE AND DO NOT POISON THE AIR WITH THESE SOUNDS OF MALICE.I HAVE DECLARED MY RESOLUTION TO YOU AND I AM NO COWARD TO BENDBENEATH WORDS. LEAVE ME I AM INEXORABLE.IT IS WELL. I GO BUT REMEMBER I SHALL BE WITH YOU ON YOURWEDDINGNIGHT.I STARTED FORWARD AND EXCLAIMED VILLAIN BEFORE YOU SIGN MYDEATHWARRANT BE SURE THAT YOU ARE YOURSELF SAFE.I WOULD HAVE SEIZED HIM BUT HE ELUDED ME AND QUITTED THE HOUSE WITHPRECIPITATION. IN A FEW MOMENTS I SAW HIM IN HIS BOAT WHICH SHOTACROSS THE WATERS WITH AN ARROWY SWIFTNESS AND WAS SOON LOST AMIDST THEWAVES.ALL WAS AGAIN SILENT BUT HIS WORDS RANG IN MY EARS. I BURNED WITH RAGE TOPURSUE THE MURDERER OF MY PEACE AND PRECIPITATE HIM INTO THE OCEAN. IWALKED UP AND DOWN MY ROOM HASTILY AND PERTURBED WHILE MY IMAGINATIONCONJURED UP A THOUSAND IMAGES TO TORMENT AND STING ME. WHY HAD I NOTFOLLOWED HIM AND CLOSED WITH HIM IN MORTAL STRIFE BUT I HAD SUFFERED HIMTO DEPART AND HE HAD DIRECTED HIS COURSE TOWARDS THE MAINLAND. I SHUDDEREDTO THINK WHO MIGHT BE THE NEXT VICTIM SACRIFICED TO HIS INSATIATE REVENGE.AND THEN I THOUGHT AGAIN OF HIS WORDSI WILL BE WITH YOU ONYOUR WEDDINGNIGHT. THAT THEN WAS THE PERIOD FIXED FOR THEFULFILMENT OF MY DESTINY. IN THAT HOUR I SHOULD DIE AND AT ONCE SATISFY ANDEXTINGUISH HIS MALICE. THE PROSPECT DID NOT MOVE ME TO FEAR YET WHEN ITHOUGHT OF MY BELOVED ELIZABETH OF HER TEARS AND ENDLESS SORROW WHEN SHESHOULD FIND HER LOVER SO BARBAROUSLY SNATCHED FROM HER TEARS THE FIRST IHAD SHED FOR MANY MONTHS STREAMED FROM MY EYES AND I RESOLVED NOT TO FALLBEFORE MY ENEMY WITHOUT A BITTER STRUGGLE.THE NIGHT PASSED AWAY AND THE SUN ROSE FROM THE OCEAN MY FEELINGS BECAMECALMER IF IT MAY BE CALLED CALMNESS WHEN THE VIOLENCE OF RAGE SINKS INTOTHE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR. I LEFT THE HOUSE THE HORRID SCENE OF THE LASTNIGHTS CONTENTION AND WALKED ON THE BEACH OF THE SEA WHICH IALMOST REGARDED AS AN INSUPERABLE BARRIER BETWEEN ME AND MY FELLOWCREATURES NAY A WISH THAT SUCH SHOULD PROVE THE FACT STOLE ACROSS ME. IDESIRED THAT I MIGHT PASS MY LIFE ON THAT BARREN ROCK WEARILY IT IS TRUEBUT UNINTERRUPTED BY ANY SUDDEN SHOCK OF MISERY. IF I RETURNED IT WAS TOBE SACRIFICED OR TO SEE THOSE WHOM I MOST LOVED DIE UNDER THE GRASP OF ADMON WHOM I HAD MYSELF CREATED.I WALKED ABOUT THE ISLE LIKE A RESTLESS SPECTRE SEPARATED FROM ALL ITLOVED AND MISERABLE IN THE SEPARATION. WHEN IT BECAME NOON AND THESUN ROSE HIGHER I LAY DOWN ON THE GRASS AND WAS OVERPOWERED BY A DEEPSLEEP. I HAD BEEN AWAKE THE WHOLE OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT MY NERVESWERE AGITATED AND MY EYES INFLAMED BY WATCHING AND MISERY. THE SLEEPINTO WHICH I NOW SANK REFRESHED ME AND WHEN I AWOKE I AGAIN FELT ASIF I BELONGED TO A RACE OF HUMAN BEINGS LIKE MYSELF AND I BEGAN TOREFLECT UPON WHAT HAD PASSED WITH GREATER COMPOSURE YET STILL THEWORDS OF THE FIEND RANG IN MY EARS LIKE A DEATHKNELL THEY APPEAREDLIKE A DREAM YET DISTINCT AND OPPRESSIVE AS A REALITY.THE SUN HAD FAR DESCENDED AND I STILL SAT ON THE SHORE SATISFYING MYAPPETITE WHICH HAD BECOME RAVENOUS WITH AN OATEN CAKE WHEN I SAW AFISHINGBOAT LAND CLOSE TO ME AND ONE OF THE MEN BROUGHT ME A PACKETIT CONTAINED LETTERS FROM GENEVA AND ONE FROM CLERVAL ENTREATING ME TOJOIN HIM. HE SAID THAT HE WAS WEARING AWAY HIS TIME FRUITLESSLY WHEREHE WAS THAT LETTERS FROM THE FRIENDS HE HAD FORMED IN LONDON DESIREDHIS RETURN TO COMPLETE THE NEGOTIATION THEY HAD ENTERED INTO FOR HISINDIAN ENTERPRISE. HE COULD NOT ANY LONGER DELAY HIS DEPARTURE BUT ASHIS JOURNEY TO LONDON MIGHT BE FOLLOWED EVEN SOONER THAN HE NOWCONJECTURED BY HIS LONGER VOYAGE HE ENTREATED ME TO BESTOW AS MUCH OFMY SOCIETY ON HIM AS I COULD SPARE. HE BESOUGHT ME THEREFORE TOLEAVE MY SOLITARY ISLE AND TO MEET HIM AT PERTH THAT WE MIGHT PROCEEDSOUTHWARDS TOGETHER. THIS LETTER IN A DEGREE RECALLED ME TO LIFE ANDI DETERMINED TO QUIT MY ISLAND AT THE EXPIRATION OF TWO DAYS.YET BEFORE I DEPARTED THERE WAS A TASK TO PERFORM ON WHICH I SHUDDEREDTO REFLECT I MUST PACK UP MY CHEMICAL INSTRUMENTS AND FOR THAT PURPOSE IMUST ENTER THE ROOM WHICH HAD BEEN THE SCENE OF MY ODIOUS WORK AND I MUSTHANDLE THOSE UTENSILS THE SIGHT OF WHICH WAS SICKENING TO ME. THE NEXTMORNING AT DAYBREAK I SUMMONED SUFFICIENT COURAGE AND UNLOCKED THE DOOROF MY LABORATORY. THE REMAINS OF THE HALFFINISHED CREATURE WHOM I HADDESTROYED LAY SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR AND I ALMOST FELT AS IF I HADMANGLED THE LIVING FLESH OF A HUMAN BEING. I PAUSED TO COLLECT MYSELF ANDTHEN ENTERED THE CHAMBER. WITH TREMBLING HAND I CONVEYED THE INSTRUMENTSOUT OF THE ROOM BUT I REFLECTED THAT I OUGHT NOT TO LEAVE THE RELICS OF MYWORK TO EXCITE THE HORROR AND SUSPICION OF THE PEASANTS AND I ACCORDINGLYPUT THEM INTO A BASKET WITH A GREAT QUANTITY OF STONES AND LAYING THEMUP DETERMINED TO THROW THEM INTO THE SEA THAT VERY NIGHT AND IN THEMEANTIME I SAT UPON THE BEACH EMPLOYED IN CLEANING AND ARRANGING MYCHEMICAL APPARATUS.NOTHING COULD BE MORE COMPLETE THAN THE ALTERATION THAT HAD TAKEN PLACEIN MY FEELINGS SINCE THE NIGHT OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE DMON. I HADBEFORE REGARDED MY PROMISE WITH A GLOOMY DESPAIR AS A THING THAT WITHWHATEVER CONSEQUENCES MUST BE FULFILLED BUT I NOW FELT AS IF A FILMHAD BEEN TAKEN FROM BEFORE MY EYES AND THAT I FOR THE FIRST TIME SAWCLEARLY. THE IDEA OF RENEWING MY LABOURS DID NOT FOR ONE INSTANT OCCURTO ME THE THREAT I HAD HEARD WEIGHED ON MY THOUGHTS BUT I DID NOTREFLECT THAT A VOLUNTARY ACT OF MINE COULD AVERT IT. I HAD RESOLVED INMY OWN MIND THAT TO CREATE ANOTHER LIKE THE FIEND I HAD FIRST MADEWOULD BE AN ACT OF THE BASEST AND MOST ATROCIOUS SELFISHNESS AND IBANISHED FROM MY MIND EVERY THOUGHT THAT COULD LEAD TO A DIFFERENTCONCLUSION.BETWEEN TWO AND THREE IN THE MORNING THE MOON ROSE AND I THEN PUTTING MYBASKET ABOARD A LITTLE SKIFF SAILED OUT ABOUT FOUR MILES FROM THE SHORE.THE SCENE WAS PERFECTLY SOLITARY A FEW BOATS WERE RETURNING TOWARDS LANDBUT I SAILED AWAY FROM THEM. I FELT AS IF I WAS ABOUT THE COMMISSION OF ADREADFUL CRIME AND AVOIDED WITH SHUDDERING ANXIETY ANY ENCOUNTER WITH MYFELLOW CREATURES. AT ONE TIME THE MOON WHICH HAD BEFORE BEEN CLEAR WASSUDDENLY OVERSPREAD BY A THICK CLOUD AND I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE MOMENT OFDARKNESS AND CAST MY BASKET INTO THE SEA I LISTENED TO THE GURGLING SOUNDAS IT SANK AND THEN SAILED AWAY FROM THE SPOT. THE SKY BECAME CLOUDED BUTTHE AIR WAS PURE ALTHOUGH CHILLED BY THE NORTHEAST BREEZE THAT WAS THENRISING. BUT IT REFRESHED ME AND FILLED ME WITH SUCH AGREEABLE SENSATIONSTHAT I RESOLVED TO PROLONG MY STAY ON THE WATER AND FIXING THE RUDDER IN ADIRECT POSITION STRETCHED MYSELF AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT. CLOUDS HID THEMOON EVERYTHING WAS OBSCURE AND I HEARD ONLY THE SOUND OF THE BOAT AS ITSKEEL CUT THROUGH THE WAVES THE MURMUR LULLED ME AND IN A SHORT TIME ISLEPT SOUNDLY.I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG I REMAINED IN THIS SITUATION BUT WHEN I AWOKE IFOUND THAT THE SUN HAD ALREADY MOUNTED CONSIDERABLY. THE WIND WAS HIGH ANDTHE WAVES CONTINUALLY THREATENED THE SAFETY OF MY LITTLE SKIFF. I FOUNDTHAT THE WIND WAS NORTHEAST AND MUST HAVE DRIVEN ME FAR FROM THE COAST FROMWHICH I HAD EMBARKED. I ENDEAVOURED TO CHANGE MY COURSE BUT QUICKLY FOUNDTHAT IF I AGAIN MADE THE ATTEMPT THE BOAT WOULD BE INSTANTLY FILLED WITHWATER. THUS SITUATED MY ONLY RESOURCE WAS TO DRIVE BEFORE THE WIND. ICONFESS THAT I FELT A FEW SENSATIONS OF TERROR. I HAD NO COMPASS WITH MEAND WAS SO SLENDERLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE GEOGRAPHY OF THIS PART OF THEWORLD THAT THE SUN WAS OF LITTLE BENEFIT TO ME. I MIGHT BE DRIVEN INTO THEWIDE ATLANTIC AND FEEL ALL THE TORTURES OF STARVATION OR BE SWALLOWED UP INTHE IMMEASURABLE WATERS THAT ROARED AND BUFFETED AROUND ME. I HAD ALREADYBEEN OUT MANY HOURS AND FELT THE TORMENT OF A BURNING THIRST A PRELUDE TOMY OTHER SUFFERINGS. I LOOKED ON THE HEAVENS WHICH WERE COVERED BY CLOUDSTHAT FLEW BEFORE THE WIND ONLY TO BE REPLACED BY OTHERS I LOOKED UPON THESEA IT WAS TO BE MY GRAVE. FIEND I EXCLAIMED YOURTASK IS ALREADY FULFILLED I THOUGHT OF ELIZABETH OF MY FATHER ANDOF CLERVALALL LEFT BEHIND ON WHOM THE MONSTER MIGHT SATISFY HISSANGUINARY AND MERCILESS PASSIONS. THIS IDEA PLUNGED ME INTO A REVERIE SODESPAIRING AND FRIGHTFUL THAT EVEN NOW WHEN THE SCENE IS ON THE POINT OFCLOSING BEFORE ME FOR EVER I SHUDDER TO REFLECT ON IT.SOME HOURS PASSED THUS BUT BY DEGREES AS THE SUN DECLINED TOWARDS THEHORIZON THE WIND DIED AWAY INTO A GENTLE BREEZE AND THE SEA BECAMEFREE FROM BREAKERS. BUT THESE GAVE PLACE TO A HEAVY SWELL I FELT SICKAND HARDLY ABLE TO HOLD THE RUDDER WHEN SUDDENLY I SAW A LINE OF HIGHLAND TOWARDS THE SOUTH.ALMOST SPENT AS I WAS BY FATIGUE AND THE DREADFUL SUSPENSE I ENDUREDFOR SEVERAL HOURS THIS SUDDEN CERTAINTY OF LIFE RUSHED LIKE A FLOOD OFWARM JOY TO MY HEART AND TEARS GUSHED FROM MY EYES.HOW MUTABLE ARE OUR FEELINGS AND HOW STRANGE IS THAT CLINGING LOVE WE HAVEOF LIFE EVEN IN THE EXCESS OF MISERY I CONSTRUCTED ANOTHER SAIL WITH APART OF MY DRESS AND EAGERLY STEERED MY COURSE TOWARDS THE LAND. IT HAD AWILD AND ROCKY APPEARANCE BUT AS I APPROACHED NEARER I EASILY PERCEIVEDTHE TRACES OF CULTIVATION. I SAW VESSELS NEAR THE SHORE AND FOUND MYSELFSUDDENLY TRANSPORTED BACK TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF CIVILISED MAN. ICAREFULLY TRACED THE WINDINGS OF THE LAND AND HAILED A STEEPLE WHICH I ATLENGTH SAW ISSUING FROM BEHIND A SMALL PROMONTORY. AS I WAS IN A STATE OFEXTREME DEBILITY I RESOLVED TO SAIL DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE TOWN AS A PLACEWHERE I COULD MOST EASILY PROCURE NOURISHMENT. FORTUNATELY I HAD MONEY WITHME. AS I TURNED THE PROMONTORY I PERCEIVED A SMALL NEAT TOWN AND A GOODHARBOUR WHICH I ENTERED MY HEART BOUNDING WITH JOY AT MY UNEXPECTEDESCAPE.AS I WAS OCCUPIED IN FIXING THE BOAT AND ARRANGING THE SAILS SEVERALPEOPLE CROWDED TOWARDS THE SPOT. THEY SEEMED MUCH SURPRISED AT MYAPPEARANCE BUT INSTEAD OF OFFERING ME ANY ASSISTANCE WHISPEREDTOGETHER WITH GESTURES THAT AT ANY OTHER TIME MIGHT HAVE PRODUCED IN MEA SLIGHT SENSATION OF ALARM. AS IT WAS I MERELY REMARKED THAT THEYSPOKE ENGLISH AND I THEREFORE ADDRESSED THEM IN THAT LANGUAGE. MYGOOD FRIENDS SAID I WILL YOU BE SO KIND AS TO TELL ME THE NAME OFTHIS TOWN AND INFORM ME WHERE I AMYOU WILL KNOW THAT SOON ENOUGH REPLIED A MAN WITH A HOARSE VOICE.MAYBE YOU ARE COME TO A PLACE THAT WILL NOT PROVE MUCH TO YOUR TASTEBUT YOU WILL NOT BE CONSULTED AS TO YOUR QUARTERS I PROMISE YOU.I WAS EXCEEDINGLY SURPRISED ON RECEIVING SO RUDE AN ANSWER FROM ASTRANGER AND I WAS ALSO DISCONCERTED ON PERCEIVING THE FROWNING ANDANGRY COUNTENANCES OF HIS COMPANIONS. WHY DO YOU ANSWER ME SOROUGHLY I REPLIED. SURELY IT IS NOT THE CUSTOM OF ENGLISHMEN TORECEIVE STRANGERS SO INHOSPITABLY.I DO NOT KNOW SAID THE MAN WHAT THE CUSTOM OF THEENGLISH MAY BE BUT IT IS THE CUSTOM OF THE IRISH TO HATE VILLAINS.WHILE THIS STRANGE DIALOGUE CONTINUED I PERCEIVED THE CROWD RAPIDLYINCREASE. THEIR FACES EXPRESSED A MIXTURE OF CURIOSITY AND ANGER WHICHANNOYED AND IN SOME DEGREE ALARMED ME. I INQUIRED THE WAY TO THE INN BUTNO ONE REPLIED. I THEN MOVED FORWARD AND A MURMURING SOUND AROSE FROM THECROWD AS THEY FOLLOWED AND SURROUNDED ME WHEN AN ILLLOOKING MANAPPROACHING TAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AND SAID COME SIR YOU MUSTFOLLOW ME TO MR. KIRWINS TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF YOURSELF.WHO IS MR. KIRWIN WHY AM I TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF IS NOTTHIS A FREE COUNTRYAY SIR FREE ENOUGH FOR HONEST FOLKS. MR. KIRWIN IS A MAGISTRATEAND YOU ARE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF A GENTLEMAN WHO WASFOUND MURDERED HERE LAST NIGHT.THIS ANSWER STARTLED ME BUT I PRESENTLY RECOVERED MYSELF. I WAS INNOCENTTHAT COULD EASILY BE PROVED ACCORDINGLY I FOLLOWED MY CONDUCTOR IN SILENCEAND WAS LED TO ONE OF THE BEST HOUSES IN THE TOWN. I WAS READY TO SINK FROMFATIGUE AND HUNGER BUT BEING SURROUNDED BY A CROWD I THOUGHT IT POLITICTO ROUSE ALL MY STRENGTH THAT NO PHYSICAL DEBILITY MIGHT BE CONSTRUED INTOAPPREHENSION OR CONSCIOUS GUILT. LITTLE DID I THEN EXPECT THE CALAMITY THATWAS IN A FEW MOMENTS TO OVERWHELM ME AND EXTINGUISH IN HORROR AND DESPAIRALL FEAR OF IGNOMINY OR DEATH.I MUST PAUSE HERE FOR IT REQUIRES ALL MY FORTITUDE TO RECALL THE MEMORY OFTHE FRIGHTFUL EVENTS WHICH I AM ABOUT TO RELATE IN PROPER DETAIL TO MYRECOLLECTION.CHAPTER I WAS SOON INTRODUCED INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE MAGISTRATE AN OLDBENEVOLENT MAN WITH CALM AND MILD MANNERS. HE LOOKED UPON ME HOWEVERWITH SOME DEGREE OF SEVERITY AND THEN TURNING TOWARDS MY CONDUCTORSHE ASKED WHO APPEARED AS WITNESSES ON THIS OCCASION.ABOUT HALF A DOZEN MEN CAME FORWARD AND ONE BEING SELECTED BY THEMAGISTRATE HE DEPOSED THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT FISHING THE NIGHT BEFORE WITHHIS SON AND BROTHERINLAW DANIEL NUGENT WHEN ABOUT TEN OCLOCKTHEY OBSERVED A STRONG NORTHERLY BLAST RISING AND THEY ACCORDINGLY PUT INFOR PORT. IT WAS A VERY DARK NIGHT AS THE MOON HAD NOT YET RISEN THEY DIDNOT LAND AT THE HARBOUR BUT AS THEY HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED AT A CREEK ABOUTTWO MILES BELOW. HE WALKED ON FIRST CARRYING A PART OF THE FISHING TACKLEAND HIS COMPANIONS FOLLOWED HIM AT SOME DISTANCE. AS HE WAS PROCEEDINGALONG THE SANDS HE STRUCK HIS FOOT AGAINST SOMETHING AND FELL AT HISLENGTH ON THE GROUND. HIS COMPANIONS CAME UP TO ASSIST HIM AND BY THELIGHT OF THEIR LANTERN THEY FOUND THAT HE HAD FALLEN ON THE BODY OF A MANWHO WAS TO ALL APPEARANCE DEAD. THEIR FIRST SUPPOSITION WAS THAT IT WAS THECORPSE OF SOME PERSON WHO HAD BEEN DROWNED AND WAS THROWN ON SHORE BY THEWAVES BUT ON EXAMINATION THEY FOUND THAT THE CLOTHES WERE NOT WET AND EVENTHAT THE BODY WAS NOT THEN COLD. THEY INSTANTLY CARRIED IT TO THE COTTAGEOF AN OLD WOMAN NEAR THE SPOT AND ENDEAVOURED BUT IN VAIN TO RESTORE ITTO LIFE. IT APPEARED TO BE A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTYYEARS OF AGE. HE HAD APPARENTLY BEEN STRANGLED FOR THERE WAS NO SIGN OFANY VIOLENCE EXCEPT THE BLACK MARK OF FINGERS ON HIS NECK.THE FIRST PART OF THIS DEPOSITION DID NOT IN THE LEAST INTEREST ME BUTWHEN THE MARK OF THE FINGERS WAS MENTIONED I REMEMBERED THE MURDER OFMY BROTHER AND FELT MYSELF EXTREMELY AGITATED MY LIMBS TREMBLED AND AMIST CAME OVER MY EYES WHICH OBLIGED ME TO LEAN ON A CHAIR FORSUPPORT. THE MAGISTRATE OBSERVED ME WITH A KEEN EYE AND OF COURSE DREWAN UNFAVOURABLE AUGURY FROM MY MANNER.THE SON CONFIRMED HIS FATHERS ACCOUNT BUT WHEN DANIEL NUGENT WASCALLED HE SWORE POSITIVELY THAT JUST BEFORE THE FALL OF HIS COMPANION HESAW A BOAT WITH A SINGLE MAN IN IT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE SHOREAND AS FAR AS HE COULD JUDGE BY THE LIGHT OF A FEW STARS IT WAS THE SAMEBOAT IN WHICH I HAD JUST LANDED.A WOMAN DEPOSED THAT SHE LIVED NEAR THE BEACH AND WAS STANDING AT THE DOOROF HER COTTAGE WAITING FOR THE RETURN OF THE FISHERMEN ABOUT AN HOURBEFORE SHE HEARD OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE BODY WHEN SHE SAW A BOAT WITHONLY ONE MAN IN IT PUSH OFF FROM THAT PART OF THE SHORE WHERE THE CORPSEWAS AFTERWARDS FOUND.ANOTHER WOMAN CONFIRMED THE ACCOUNT OF THE FISHERMEN HAVING BROUGHT THEBODY INTO HER HOUSE IT WAS NOT COLD. THEY PUT IT INTO A BED ANDRUBBED IT AND DANIEL WENT TO THE TOWN FOR AN APOTHECARY BUT LIFE WASQUITE GONE.SEVERAL OTHER MEN WERE EXAMINED CONCERNING MY LANDING AND THEY AGREEDTHAT WITH THE STRONG NORTH WIND THAT HAD ARISEN DURING THE NIGHT ITWAS VERY PROBABLE THAT I HAD BEATEN ABOUT FOR MANY HOURS AND HAD BEENOBLIGED TO RETURN NEARLY TO THE SAME SPOT FROM WHICH I HAD DEPARTED.BESIDES THEY OBSERVED THAT IT APPEARED THAT I HAD BROUGHT THE BODYFROM ANOTHER PLACE AND IT WAS LIKELY THAT AS I DID NOT APPEAR TO KNOWTHE SHORE I MIGHT HAVE PUT INTO THE HARBOUR IGNORANT OF THE DISTANCEOF THE TOWN OF  FROM THE PLACE WHERE I HAD DEPOSITED THE CORPSE.MR. KIRWIN ON HEARING THIS EVIDENCE DESIRED THAT I SHOULD BE TAKEN INTOTHE ROOM WHERE THE BODY LAY FOR INTERMENT THAT IT MIGHT BE OBSERVED WHATEFFECT THE SIGHT OF IT WOULD PRODUCE UPON ME. THIS IDEA WAS PROBABLYSUGGESTED BY THE EXTREME AGITATION I HAD EXHIBITED WHEN THE MODE OF THEMURDER HAD BEEN DESCRIBED. I WAS ACCORDINGLY CONDUCTED BY THE MAGISTRATEAND SEVERAL OTHER PERSONS TO THE INN. I COULD NOT HELP BEING STRUCK BY THESTRANGE COINCIDENCES THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE DURING THIS EVENTFUL NIGHT BUTKNOWING THAT I HAD BEEN CONVERSING WITH SEVERAL PERSONS IN THE ISLAND I HADINHABITED ABOUT THE TIME THAT THE BODY HAD BEEN FOUND I WAS PERFECTLYTRANQUIL AS TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE AFFAIR.I ENTERED THE ROOM WHERE THE CORPSE LAY AND WAS LED UP TO THE COFFIN. HOWCAN I DESCRIBE MY SENSATIONS ON BEHOLDING IT I FEEL YET PARCHED WITHHORROR NOR CAN I REFLECT ON THAT TERRIBLE MOMENT WITHOUT SHUDDERING ANDAGONY. THE EXAMINATION THE PRESENCE OF THE MAGISTRATE AND WITNESSESPASSED LIKE A DREAM FROM MY MEMORY WHEN I SAW THE LIFELESS FORM OF HENRYCLERVAL STRETCHED BEFORE ME. I GASPED FOR BREATH AND THROWING MYSELF ONTHE BODY I EXCLAIMED HAVE MY MURDEROUS MACHINATIONS DEPRIVED YOUALSO MY DEAREST HENRY OF LIFE TWO I HAVE ALREADY DESTROYED OTHERVICTIMS AWAIT THEIR DESTINY BUT YOU CLERVAL MY FRIEND MYBENEFACTORTHE HUMAN FRAME COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THE AGONIES THAT I ENDURED ANDI WAS CARRIED OUT OF THE ROOM IN STRONG CONVULSIONS.A FEVER SUCCEEDED TO THIS. I LAY FOR TWO MONTHS ON THE POINT OF DEATH MYRAVINGS AS I AFTERWARDS HEARD WERE FRIGHTFUL I CALLED MYSELF THEMURDERER OF WILLIAM OF JUSTINE AND OF CLERVAL. SOMETIMES I ENTREATED MYATTENDANTS TO ASSIST ME IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FIEND BY WHOM I WASTORMENTED AND AT OTHERS I FELT THE FINGERS OF THE MONSTER ALREADY GRASPINGMY NECK AND SCREAMED ALOUD WITH AGONY AND TERROR. FORTUNATELY AS I SPOKEMY NATIVE LANGUAGE MR. KIRWIN ALONE UNDERSTOOD ME BUT MY GESTURES ANDBITTER CRIES WERE SUFFICIENT TO AFFRIGHT THE OTHER WITNESSES.WHY DID I NOT DIE MORE MISERABLE THAN MAN EVER WAS BEFORE WHY DID I NOTSINK INTO FORGETFULNESS AND REST DEATH SNATCHES AWAY MANY BLOOMINGCHILDREN THE ONLY HOPES OF THEIR DOTING PARENTS HOW MANY BRIDES ANDYOUTHFUL LOVERS HAVE BEEN ONE DAY IN THE BLOOM OF HEALTH AND HOPE AND THENEXT A PREY FOR WORMS AND THE DECAY OF THE TOMB OF WHAT MATERIALS WAS IMADE THAT I COULD THUS RESIST SO MANY SHOCKS WHICH LIKE THE TURNING OFTHE WHEEL CONTINUALLY RENEWED THE TORTUREBUT I WAS DOOMED TO LIVE AND IN TWO MONTHS FOUND MYSELF AS AWAKING FROMA DREAM IN A PRISON STRETCHED ON A WRETCHED BED SURROUNDED BYGAOLERS TURNKEYS BOLTS AND ALL THE MISERABLE APPARATUS OF A DUNGEON.IT WAS MORNING I REMEMBER WHEN I THUS AWOKE TO UNDERSTANDING I HADFORGOTTEN THE PARTICULARS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND ONLY FELT AS IF SOMEGREAT MISFORTUNE HAD SUDDENLY OVERWHELMED ME BUT WHEN I LOOKED AROUNDAND SAW THE BARRED WINDOWS AND THE SQUALIDNESS OF THE ROOM IN WHICH IWAS ALL FLASHED ACROSS MY MEMORY AND I GROANED BITTERLY.THIS SOUND DISTURBED AN OLD WOMAN WHO WAS SLEEPING IN A CHAIR BESIDEME. SHE WAS A HIRED NURSE THE WIFE OF ONE OF THE TURNKEYS AND HERCOUNTENANCE EXPRESSED ALL THOSE BAD QUALITIES WHICH OFTEN CHARACTERISETHAT CLASS. THE LINES OF HER FACE WERE HARD AND RUDE LIKE THAT OFPERSONS ACCUSTOMED TO SEE WITHOUT SYMPATHISING IN SIGHTS OF MISERY. HERTONE EXPRESSED HER ENTIRE INDIFFERENCE SHE ADDRESSED ME IN ENGLISHAND THE VOICE STRUCK ME AS ONE THAT I HAD HEARD DURING MY SUFFERINGS.ARE YOU BETTER NOW SIR SAID SHE.I REPLIED IN THE SAME LANGUAGE WITH A FEEBLE VOICE I BELIEVE I AMBUT IF IT BE ALL TRUE IF INDEED I DID NOT DREAM I AM SORRY THAT I AMSTILL ALIVE TO FEEL THIS MISERY AND HORROR.FOR THAT MATTER REPLIED THE OLD WOMAN IF YOU MEAN ABOUT THEGENTLEMAN YOU MURDERED I BELIEVE THAT IT WERE BETTER FOR YOU IF YOUWERE DEAD FOR I FANCY IT WILL GO HARD WITH YOU HOWEVER THATS NONEOF MY BUSINESS I AM SENT TO NURSE YOU AND GET YOU WELL I DO MY DUTYWITH A SAFE CONSCIENCE IT WERE WELL IF EVERYBODY DID THE SAME.I TURNED WITH LOATHING FROM THE WOMAN WHO COULD UTTER SO UNFEELING ASPEECH TO A PERSON JUST SAVED ON THE VERY EDGE OF DEATH BUT I FELTLANGUID AND UNABLE TO REFLECT ON ALL THAT HAD PASSED. THE WHOLE SERIESOF MY LIFE APPEARED TO ME AS A DREAM I SOMETIMES DOUBTED IF INDEED ITWERE ALL TRUE FOR IT NEVER PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND WITH THE FORCEOF REALITY.AS THE IMAGES THAT FLOATED BEFORE ME BECAME MORE DISTINCT I GREWFEVERISH A DARKNESS PRESSED AROUND ME NO ONE WAS NEAR ME WHO SOOTHEDME WITH THE GENTLE VOICE OF LOVE NO DEAR HAND SUPPORTED ME. THEPHYSICIAN CAME AND PRESCRIBED MEDICINES AND THE OLD WOMAN PREPAREDTHEM FOR ME BUT UTTER CARELESSNESS WAS VISIBLE IN THE FIRST AND THEEXPRESSION OF BRUTALITY WAS STRONGLY MARKED IN THE VISAGE OF THESECOND. WHO COULD BE INTERESTED IN THE FATE OF A MURDERER BUT THEHANGMAN WHO WOULD GAIN HIS FEETHESE WERE MY FIRST REFLECTIONS BUT I SOON LEARNED THAT MR. KIRWIN HADSHOWN ME EXTREME KINDNESS. HE HAD CAUSED THE BEST ROOM IN THE PRISONTO BE PREPARED FOR ME WRETCHED INDEED WAS THE BEST AND IT WAS HE WHOHAD PROVIDED A PHYSICIAN AND A NURSE. IT IS TRUE HE SELDOM CAME TOSEE ME FOR ALTHOUGH HE ARDENTLY DESIRED TO RELIEVE THE SUFFERINGS OFEVERY HUMAN CREATURE HE DID NOT WISH TO BE PRESENT AT THE AGONIES ANDMISERABLE RAVINGS OF A MURDERER. HE CAME THEREFORE SOMETIMES TO SEETHAT I WAS NOT NEGLECTED BUT HIS VISITS WERE SHORT AND WITH LONGINTERVALS.ONE DAY WHILE I WAS GRADUALLY RECOVERING I WAS SEATED IN A CHAIR MY EYESHALF OPEN AND MY CHEEKS LIVID LIKE THOSE IN DEATH. I WAS OVERCOME BY GLOOMAND MISERY AND OFTEN REFLECTED I HAD BETTER SEEK DEATH THAN DESIRE TOREMAIN IN A WORLD WHICH TO ME WAS REPLETE WITH WRETCHEDNESS. AT ONE TIME ICONSIDERED WHETHER I SHOULD NOT DECLARE MYSELF GUILTY AND SUFFER THEPENALTY OF THE LAW LESS INNOCENT THAN POOR JUSTINE HAD BEEN. SUCH WERE MYTHOUGHTS WHEN THE DOOR OF MY APARTMENT WAS OPENED AND MR. KIRWIN ENTERED.HIS COUNTENANCE EXPRESSED SYMPATHY AND COMPASSION HE DREW A CHAIR CLOSE TOMINE AND ADDRESSED ME IN FRENCHI FEAR THAT THIS PLACE IS VERY SHOCKING TO YOU CAN I DO ANYTHING TOMAKE YOU MORE COMFORTABLEI THANK YOU BUT ALL THAT YOU MENTION IS NOTHING TO ME ON THE WHOLEEARTH THERE IS NO COMFORT WHICH I AM CAPABLE OF RECEIVING.I KNOW THAT THE SYMPATHY OF A STRANGER CAN BE BUT OF LITTLE RELIEF TOONE BORNE DOWN AS YOU ARE BY SO STRANGE A MISFORTUNE. BUT YOU WILL IHOPE SOON QUIT THIS MELANCHOLY ABODE FOR DOUBTLESS EVIDENCE CANEASILY BE BROUGHT TO FREE YOU FROM THE CRIMINAL CHARGE.THAT IS MY LEAST CONCERN I AM BY A COURSE OF STRANGE EVENTS BECOMETHE MOST MISERABLE OF MORTALS. PERSECUTED AND TORTURED AS I AM ANDHAVE BEEN CAN DEATH BE ANY EVIL TO MENOTHING INDEED COULD BE MORE UNFORTUNATE AND AGONISING THAN THESTRANGE CHANCES THAT HAVE LATELY OCCURRED. YOU WERE THROWN BY SOMESURPRISING ACCIDENT ON THIS SHORE RENOWNED FOR ITS HOSPITALITYSEIZED IMMEDIATELY AND CHARGED WITH MURDER. THE FIRST SIGHT THAT WASPRESENTED TO YOUR EYES WAS THE BODY OF YOUR FRIEND MURDERED IN SOUNACCOUNTABLE A MANNER AND PLACED AS IT WERE BY SOME FIEND ACROSSYOUR PATH.AS MR. KIRWIN SAID THIS NOTWITHSTANDING THE AGITATION I ENDURED ONTHIS RETROSPECT OF MY SUFFERINGS I ALSO FELT CONSIDERABLE SURPRISE ATTHE KNOWLEDGE HE SEEMED TO POSSESS CONCERNING ME. I SUPPOSE SOMEASTONISHMENT WAS EXHIBITED IN MY COUNTENANCE FOR MR. KIRWIN HASTENEDTO SAYIMMEDIATELY UPON YOUR BEING TAKEN ILL ALL THE PAPERS THAT WERE ONYOUR PERSON WERE BROUGHT ME AND I EXAMINED THEM THAT I MIGHT DISCOVER SOMETRACE BY WHICH I COULD SEND TO YOUR RELATIONS AN ACCOUNT OF YOUR MISFORTUNEAND ILLNESS. I FOUND SEVERAL LETTERS AND AMONG OTHERS ONE WHICH IDISCOVERED FROM ITS COMMENCEMENT TO BE FROM YOUR FATHER. I INSTANTLY WROTETO GENEVA NEARLY TWO MONTHS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE DEPARTURE OF MY LETTER.BUT YOU ARE ILL EVEN NOW YOU TREMBLE YOU ARE UNFIT FOR AGITATION OF ANYKIND.THIS SUSPENSE IS A THOUSAND TIMES WORSE THAN THE MOST HORRIBLE EVENTTELL ME WHAT NEW SCENE OF DEATH HAS BEEN ACTED AND WHOSE MURDER I AMNOW TO LAMENTYOUR FAMILY IS PERFECTLY WELL SAID MR. KIRWIN WITHGENTLENESS AND SOMEONE A FRIEND IS COME TO VISIT YOU.I KNOW NOT BY WHAT CHAIN OF THOUGHT THE IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF BUT ITINSTANTLY DARTED INTO MY MIND THAT THE MURDERER HAD COME TO MOCK AT MYMISERY AND TAUNT ME WITH THE DEATH OF CLERVAL AS A NEW INCITEMENT FORME TO COMPLY WITH HIS HELLISH DESIRES. I PUT MY HAND BEFORE MY EYESAND CRIED OUT IN AGONYOH TAKE HIM AWAY I CANNOT SEE HIM FOR GODS SAKE DO NOTLET HIM ENTERMR. KIRWIN REGARDED ME WITH A TROUBLED COUNTENANCE. HE COULD NOT HELPREGARDING MY EXCLAMATION AS A PRESUMPTION OF MY GUILT AND SAID INRATHER A SEVERE TONEI SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOUNG MAN THAT THE PRESENCE OF YOUR FATHERWOULD HAVE BEEN WELCOME INSTEAD OF INSPIRING SUCH VIOLENT REPUGNANCE.MY FATHER CRIED I WHILE EVERY FEATURE AND EVERY MUSCLE WAS RELAXEDFROM ANGUISH TO PLEASURE. IS MY FATHER INDEED COME HOW KIND HOWVERY KIND BUT WHERE IS HE WHY DOES HE NOT HASTEN TO MEMY CHANGE OF MANNER SURPRISED AND PLEASED THE MAGISTRATE PERHAPS HETHOUGHT THAT MY FORMER EXCLAMATION WAS A MOMENTARY RETURN OF DELIRIUMAND NOW HE INSTANTLY RESUMED HIS FORMER BENEVOLENCE. HE ROSE ANDQUITTED THE ROOM WITH MY NURSE AND IN A MOMENT MY FATHER ENTERED IT.NOTHING AT THIS MOMENT COULD HAVE GIVEN ME GREATER PLEASURE THAN THEARRIVAL OF MY FATHER. I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND TO HIM AND CRIEDARE YOU THEN SAFEAND ELIZABETHAND ERNESTMY FATHER CALMED ME WITH ASSURANCES OF THEIR WELFARE AND ENDEAVOURED BYDWELLING ON THESE SUBJECTS SO INTERESTING TO MY HEART TO RAISE MYDESPONDING SPIRITS BUT HE SOON FELT THAT A PRISON CANNOT BE THE ABODE OFCHEERFULNESS. WHAT A PLACE IS THIS THAT YOU INHABIT MY SONSAID HE LOOKING MOURNFULLY AT THE BARRED WINDOWS AND WRETCHED APPEARANCEOF THE ROOM. YOU TRAVELLED TO SEEK HAPPINESS BUT A FATALITY SEEMSTO PURSUE YOU. AND POOR CLERVALTHE NAME OF MY UNFORTUNATE AND MURDERED FRIEND WAS AN AGITATION TOOGREAT TO BE ENDURED IN MY WEAK STATE I SHED TEARS.ALAS YES MY FATHER REPLIED I SOME DESTINY OF THEMOST HORRIBLE KIND HANGS OVER ME AND I MUST LIVE TO FULFIL IT OR SURELY ISHOULD HAVE DIED ON THE COFFIN OF HENRY.WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO CONVERSE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME FOR THEPRECARIOUS STATE OF MY HEALTH RENDERED EVERY PRECAUTION NECESSARY THATCOULD ENSURE TRANQUILLITY. MR. KIRWIN CAME IN AND INSISTED THAT MYSTRENGTH SHOULD NOT BE EXHAUSTED BY TOO MUCH EXERTION. BUT THEAPPEARANCE OF MY FATHER WAS TO ME LIKE THAT OF MY GOOD ANGEL AND IGRADUALLY RECOVERED MY HEALTH.AS MY SICKNESS QUITTED ME I WAS ABSORBED BY A GLOOMY AND BLACKMELANCHOLY THAT NOTHING COULD DISSIPATE. THE IMAGE OF CLERVAL WASFOR EVER BEFORE ME GHASTLY AND MURDERED. MORE THAN ONCE THE AGITATIONINTO WHICH THESE REFLECTIONS THREW ME MADE MY FRIENDS DREAD A DANGEROUSRELAPSE. ALAS WHY DID THEY PRESERVE SO MISERABLE AND DETESTED ALIFE IT WAS SURELY THAT I MIGHT FULFIL MY DESTINY WHICH IS NOWDRAWING TO A CLOSE. SOON OH VERY SOON WILL DEATH EXTINGUISH THESETHROBBINGS AND RELIEVE ME FROM THE MIGHTY WEIGHT OF ANGUISH THAT BEARSME TO THE DUST AND IN EXECUTING THE AWARD OF JUSTICE I SHALL ALSOSINK TO REST. THEN THE APPEARANCE OF DEATH WAS DISTANT ALTHOUGH THEWISH WAS EVER PRESENT TO MY THOUGHTS AND I OFTEN SAT FOR HOURSMOTIONLESS AND SPEECHLESS WISHING FOR SOME MIGHTY REVOLUTION THATMIGHT BURY ME AND MY DESTROYER IN ITS RUINS.THE SEASON OF THE ASSIZES APPROACHED. I HAD ALREADY BEEN THREE MONTHSIN PRISON AND ALTHOUGH I WAS STILL WEAK AND IN CONTINUAL DANGER OF ARELAPSE I WAS OBLIGED TO TRAVEL NEARLY A HUNDRED MILES TO THE COUNTRYTOWN WHERE THE COURT WAS HELD. MR. KIRWIN CHARGED HIMSELF WITH EVERYCARE OF COLLECTING WITNESSES AND ARRANGING MY DEFENCE. I WAS SPAREDTHE DISGRACE OF APPEARING PUBLICLY AS A CRIMINAL AS THE CASE WAS NOTBROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT THAT DECIDES ON LIFE AND DEATH. THE GRANDJURY REJECTED THE BILL ON ITS BEING PROVED THAT I WAS ON THE ORKNEYISLANDS AT THE HOUR THE BODY OF MY FRIEND WAS FOUND AND A FORTNIGHTAFTER MY REMOVAL I WAS LIBERATED FROM PRISON.MY FATHER WAS ENRAPTURED ON FINDING ME FREED FROM THE VEXATIONS OF ACRIMINAL CHARGE THAT I WAS AGAIN ALLOWED TO BREATHE THE FRESHATMOSPHERE AND PERMITTED TO RETURN TO MY NATIVE COUNTRY. I DID NOTPARTICIPATE IN THESE FEELINGS FOR TO ME THE WALLS OF A DUNGEON OR APALACE WERE ALIKE HATEFUL. THE CUP OF LIFE WAS POISONED FOR EVER ANDALTHOUGH THE SUN SHONE UPON ME AS UPON THE HAPPY AND GAY OF HEART ISAW AROUND ME NOTHING BUT A DENSE AND FRIGHTFUL DARKNESS PENETRATED BYNO LIGHT BUT THE GLIMMER OF TWO EYES THAT GLARED UPON ME. SOMETIMESTHEY WERE THE EXPRESSIVE EYES OF HENRY LANGUISHING IN DEATH THE DARKORBS NEARLY COVERED BY THE LIDS AND THE LONG BLACK LASHES THAT FRINGEDTHEM SOMETIMES IT WAS THE WATERY CLOUDED EYES OF THE MONSTER AS IFIRST SAW THEM IN MY CHAMBER AT INGOLSTADT.MY FATHER TRIED TO AWAKEN IN ME THE FEELINGS OF AFFECTION. HE TALKEDOF GENEVA WHICH I SHOULD SOON VISIT OF ELIZABETH AND ERNEST BUTTHESE WORDS ONLY DREW DEEP GROANS FROM ME. SOMETIMES INDEED I FELT AWISH FOR HAPPINESS AND THOUGHT WITH MELANCHOLY DELIGHT OF MY BELOVEDCOUSIN OR LONGED WITH A DEVOURING MALADIE DU PAYS TO SEE ONCE MORETHE BLUE LAKE AND RAPID RHONE THAT HAD BEEN SO DEAR TO ME IN EARLYCHILDHOOD BUT MY GENERAL STATE OF FEELING WAS A TORPOR IN WHICH APRISON WAS AS WELCOME A RESIDENCE AS THE DIVINEST SCENE IN NATURE ANDTHESE FITS WERE SELDOM INTERRUPTED BUT BY PAROXYSMS OF ANGUISH ANDDESPAIR. AT THESE MOMENTS I OFTEN ENDEAVOURED TO PUT AN END TO THEEXISTENCE I LOATHED AND IT REQUIRED UNCEASING ATTENDANCE AND VIGILANCETO RESTRAIN ME FROM COMMITTING SOME DREADFUL ACT OF VIOLENCE.YET ONE DUTY REMAINED TO ME THE RECOLLECTION OF WHICH FINALLYTRIUMPHED OVER MY SELFISH DESPAIR. IT WAS NECESSARY THAT I SHOULDRETURN WITHOUT DELAY TO GENEVA THERE TO WATCH OVER THE LIVES OF THOSEI SO FONDLY LOVED AND TO LIE IN WAIT FOR THE MURDERER THAT IF ANYCHANCE LED ME TO THE PLACE OF HIS CONCEALMENT OR IF HE DARED AGAIN TOBLAST ME BY HIS PRESENCE I MIGHT WITH UNFAILING AIM PUT AN END TOTHE EXISTENCE OF THE MONSTROUS IMAGE WHICH I HAD ENDUED WITH THEMOCKERY OF A SOUL STILL MORE MONSTROUS. MY FATHER STILL DESIRED TODELAY OUR DEPARTURE FEARFUL THAT I COULD NOT SUSTAIN THE FATIGUES OF AJOURNEY FOR I WAS A SHATTERED WRECKTHE SHADOW OF A HUMAN BEING. MYSTRENGTH WAS GONE. I WAS A MERE SKELETON AND FEVER NIGHT AND DAYPREYED UPON MY WASTED FRAME.STILL AS I URGED OUR LEAVING IRELAND WITH SUCH INQUIETUDE AND IMPATIENCEMY FATHER THOUGHT IT BEST TO YIELD. WE TOOK OUR PASSAGE ON BOARD A VESSELBOUND FOR HAVREDEGRACE AND SAILED WITH A FAIR WIND FROM THE IRISH SHORES.IT WAS MIDNIGHT. I LAY ON THE DECK LOOKING AT THE STARS AND LISTENING TOTHE DASHING OF THE WAVES. I HAILED THE DARKNESS THAT SHUT IRELAND FROM MYSIGHT AND MY PULSE BEAT WITH A FEVERISH JOY WHEN I REFLECTED THAT I SHOULDSOON SEE GENEVA. THE PAST APPEARED TO ME IN THE LIGHT OF A FRIGHTFUL DREAMYET THE VESSEL IN WHICH I WAS THE WIND THAT BLEW ME FROM THE DETESTEDSHORE OF IRELAND AND THE SEA WHICH SURROUNDED ME TOLD ME TOO FORCIBLYTHAT I WAS DECEIVED BY NO VISION AND THAT CLERVAL MY FRIEND AND DEARESTCOMPANION HAD FALLEN A VICTIM TO ME AND THE MONSTER OF MY CREATION. IREPASSED IN MY MEMORY MY WHOLE LIFE MY QUIET HAPPINESS WHILE RESIDINGWITH MY FAMILY IN GENEVA THE DEATH OF MY MOTHER AND MY DEPARTURE FORINGOLSTADT. I REMEMBERED SHUDDERING THE MAD ENTHUSIASM THAT HURRIED ME ONTO THE CREATION OF MY HIDEOUS ENEMY AND I CALLED TO MIND THE NIGHT INWHICH HE FIRST LIVED. I WAS UNABLE TO PURSUE THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT ATHOUSAND FEELINGS PRESSED UPON ME AND I WEPT BITTERLY.EVER SINCE MY RECOVERY FROM THE FEVER I HAD BEEN IN THE CUSTOM OF TAKINGEVERY NIGHT A SMALL QUANTITY OF LAUDANUM FOR IT WAS BY MEANS OF THIS DRUGONLY THAT I WAS ENABLED TO GAIN THE REST NECESSARY FOR THE PRESERVATION OFLIFE. OPPRESSED BY THE RECOLLECTION OF MY VARIOUS MISFORTUNES I NOWSWALLOWED DOUBLE MY USUAL QUANTITY AND SOON SLEPT PROFOUNDLY. BUT SLEEP DIDNOT AFFORD ME RESPITE FROM THOUGHT AND MISERY MY DREAMS PRESENTED ATHOUSAND OBJECTS THAT SCARED ME. TOWARDS MORNING I WAS POSSESSED BY A KINDOF NIGHTMARE I FELT THE FIENDS GRASP IN MY NECK AND COULD NOT FREEMYSELF FROM IT GROANS AND CRIES RANG IN MY EARS. MY FATHER WHO WASWATCHING OVER ME PERCEIVING MY RESTLESSNESS AWOKE ME THE DASHING WAVESWERE AROUND THE CLOUDY SKY ABOVE THE FIEND WAS NOT HERE A SENSE OFSECURITY A FEELING THAT A TRUCE WAS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE PRESENT HOURAND THE IRRESISTIBLE DISASTROUS FUTURE IMPARTED TO ME A KIND OF CALMFORGETFULNESS OF WHICH THE HUMAN MIND IS BY ITS STRUCTURE PECULIARLYSUSCEPTIBLE.CHAPTER THE VOYAGE CAME TO AN END. WE LANDED AND PROCEEDED TO PARIS. I SOONFOUND THAT I HAD OVERTAXED MY STRENGTH AND THAT I MUST REPOSE BEFORE ICOULD CONTINUE MY JOURNEY. MY FATHERS CARE AND ATTENTIONS WEREINDEFATIGABLE BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THE ORIGIN OF MY SUFFERINGS ANDSOUGHT ERRONEOUS METHODS TO REMEDY THE INCURABLE ILL. HE WISHED ME TOSEEK AMUSEMENT IN SOCIETY. I ABHORRED THE FACE OF MAN. OH NOTABHORRED THEY WERE MY BRETHREN MY FELLOW BEINGS AND I FELTATTRACTED EVEN TO THE MOST REPULSIVE AMONG THEM AS TO CREATURES OF ANANGELIC NATURE AND CELESTIAL MECHANISM. BUT I FELT THAT I HAD NO RIGHTTO SHARE THEIR INTERCOURSE. I HAD UNCHAINED AN ENEMY AMONG THEM WHOSEJOY IT WAS TO SHED THEIR BLOOD AND TO REVEL IN THEIR GROANS. HOW THEYWOULD EACH AND ALL ABHOR ME AND HUNT ME FROM THE WORLD DID THEY KNOWMY UNHALLOWED ACTS AND THE CRIMES WHICH HAD THEIR SOURCE IN MEMY FATHER YIELDED AT LENGTH TO MY DESIRE TO AVOID SOCIETY AND STROVE BYVARIOUS ARGUMENTS TO BANISH MY DESPAIR. SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT THAT IFELT DEEPLY THE DEGRADATION OF BEING OBLIGED TO ANSWER A CHARGE OFMURDER AND HE ENDEAVOURED TO PROVE TO ME THE FUTILITY OF PRIDE.ALAS MY FATHER SAID I HOW LITTLE DO YOU KNOW ME. HUMAN BEINGS THEIR FEELINGS AND PASSIONS WOULD INDEED BE DEGRADED IF SUCHA WRETCH AS I FELT PRIDE. JUSTINE POOR UNHAPPY JUSTINE WAS AS INNOCENTAS I AND SHE SUFFERED THE SAME CHARGE SHE DIED FOR IT AND I AM THE CAUSEOF THISI MURDERED HER. WILLIAM JUSTINE AND HENRYTHEY ALLDIED BY MY HANDS.MY FATHER HAD OFTEN DURING MY IMPRISONMENT HEARD ME MAKE THE SAMEASSERTION WHEN I THUS ACCUSED MYSELF HE SOMETIMES SEEMED TO DESIRE ANEXPLANATION AND AT OTHERS HE APPEARED TO CONSIDER IT AS THE OFFSPRING OFDELIRIUM AND THAT DURING MY ILLNESS SOME IDEA OF THIS KIND HAD PRESENTEDITSELF TO MY IMAGINATION THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHICH I PRESERVED IN MYCONVALESCENCE. I AVOIDED EXPLANATION AND MAINTAINED A CONTINUAL SILENCECONCERNING THE WRETCH I HAD CREATED. I HAD A PERSUASION THAT I SHOULD BESUPPOSED MAD AND THIS IN ITSELF WOULD FOR EVER HAVE CHAINED MY TONGUE. BUTBESIDES I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO DISCLOSE A SECRET WHICH WOULD FILL MYHEARER WITH CONSTERNATION AND MAKE FEAR AND UNNATURAL HORROR THE INMATES OFHIS BREAST. I CHECKED THEREFORE MY IMPATIENT THIRST FOR SYMPATHY AND WASSILENT WHEN I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE WORLD TO HAVE CONFIDED THE FATAL SECRET.YET STILL WORDS LIKE THOSE I HAVE RECORDED WOULD BURST UNCONTROLLABLYFROM ME. I COULD OFFER NO EXPLANATION OF THEM BUT THEIR TRUTH IN PARTRELIEVED THE BURDEN OF MY MYSTERIOUS WOE.UPON THIS OCCASION MY FATHER SAID WITH AN EXPRESSION OF UNBOUNDED WONDERMY DEAREST VICTOR WHAT INFATUATION IS THIS MY DEAR SON I ENTREATYOU NEVER TO MAKE SUCH AN ASSERTION AGAIN.I AM NOT MAD I CRIED ENERGETICALLY THE SUN AND THE HEAVENS WHOHAVE VIEWED MY OPERATIONS CAN BEAR WITNESS OF MY TRUTH. I AM THEASSASSIN OF THOSE MOST INNOCENT VICTIMS THEY DIED BY MY MACHINATIONS.A THOUSAND TIMES WOULD I HAVE SHED MY OWN BLOOD DROP BY DROP TO HAVESAVED THEIR LIVES BUT I COULD NOT MY FATHER INDEED I COULD NOTSACRIFICE THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE.THE CONCLUSION OF THIS SPEECH CONVINCED MY FATHER THAT MY IDEAS WEREDERANGED AND HE INSTANTLY CHANGED THE SUBJECT OF OUR CONVERSATION ANDENDEAVOURED TO ALTER THE COURSE OF MY THOUGHTS. HE WISHED AS MUCH ASPOSSIBLE TO OBLITERATE THE MEMORY OF THE SCENES THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE INIRELAND AND NEVER ALLUDED TO THEM OR SUFFERED ME TO SPEAK OF MYMISFORTUNES.AS TIME PASSED AWAY I BECAME MORE CALM MISERY HAD HER DWELLING IN MYHEART BUT I NO LONGER TALKED IN THE SAME INCOHERENT MANNER OF MY OWNCRIMES SUFFICIENT FOR ME WAS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THEM. BY THE UTMOSTSELFVIOLENCE I CURBED THE IMPERIOUS VOICE OF WRETCHEDNESS WHICHSOMETIMES DESIRED TO DECLARE ITSELF TO THE WHOLE WORLD AND MY MANNERSWERE CALMER AND MORE COMPOSED THAN THEY HAD EVER BEEN SINCE MY JOURNEYTO THE SEA OF ICE.A FEW DAYS BEFORE WE LEFT PARIS ON OUR WAY TO SWITZERLAND I RECEIVED THEFOLLOWING LETTER FROM ELIZABETHMY DEAR FRIENDIT GAVE ME THE GREATEST PLEASURE TO RECEIVE A LETTER FROM MY UNCLEDATED AT PARIS YOU ARE NO LONGER AT A FORMIDABLE DISTANCE AND I MAYHOPE TO SEE YOU IN LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT. MY POOR COUSIN HOW MUCH YOUMUST HAVE SUFFERED I EXPECT TO SEE YOU LOOKING EVEN MORE ILL THANWHEN YOU QUITTED GENEVA. THIS WINTER HAS BEEN PASSED MOST MISERABLYTORTURED AS I HAVE BEEN BY ANXIOUS SUSPENSE YET I HOPE TO SEE PEACE INYOUR COUNTENANCE AND TO FIND THAT YOUR HEART IS NOT TOTALLY VOID OFCOMFORT AND TRANQUILLITY.YET I FEAR THAT THE SAME FEELINGS NOW EXIST THAT MADE YOU SO MISERABLEA YEAR AGO EVEN PERHAPS AUGMENTED BY TIME. I WOULD NOT DISTURB YOU ATTHIS PERIOD WHEN SO MANY MISFORTUNES WEIGH UPON YOU BUT ACONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH MY UNCLE PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE RENDERSSOME EXPLANATION NECESSARY BEFORE WE MEET.EXPLANATION YOU MAY POSSIBLY SAY WHAT CAN ELIZABETH HAVE TO EXPLAIN IFYOU REALLY SAY THIS MY QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED AND ALL MY DOUBTS SATISFIED.BUT YOU ARE DISTANT FROM ME AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU MAY DREAD AND YETBE PLEASED WITH THIS EXPLANATION AND IN A PROBABILITY OF THIS BEING THECASE I DARE NOT ANY LONGER POSTPONE WRITING WHAT DURING YOUR ABSENCE IHAVE OFTEN WISHED TO EXPRESS TO YOU BUT HAVE NEVER HAD THE COURAGE TO BEGIN.YOU WELL KNOW VICTOR THAT OUR UNION HAD BEEN THE FAVOURITE PLAN OFYOUR PARENTS EVER SINCE OUR INFANCY. WE WERE TOLD THIS WHEN YOUNG ANDTAUGHT TO LOOK FORWARD TO IT AS AN EVENT THAT WOULD CERTAINLY TAKEPLACE. WE WERE AFFECTIONATE PLAYFELLOWS DURING CHILDHOOD AND IBELIEVE DEAR AND VALUED FRIENDS TO ONE ANOTHER AS WE GREW OLDER. BUTAS BROTHER AND SISTER OFTEN ENTERTAIN A LIVELY AFFECTION TOWARDS EACHOTHER WITHOUT DESIRING A MORE INTIMATE UNION MAY NOT SUCH ALSO BE OURCASE TELL ME DEAREST VICTOR. ANSWER ME I CONJURE YOU BY OUR MUTUALHAPPINESS WITH SIMPLE TRUTHDO YOU NOT LOVE ANOTHERYOU HAVE TRAVELLED YOU HAVE SPENT SEVERAL YEARS OF YOUR LIFE ATINGOLSTADT AND I CONFESS TO YOU MY FRIEND THAT WHEN I SAW YOU LASTAUTUMN SO UNHAPPY FLYING TO SOLITUDE FROM THE SOCIETY OF EVERYCREATURE I COULD NOT HELP SUPPOSING THAT YOU MIGHT REGRET OURCONNECTION AND BELIEVE YOURSELF BOUND IN HONOUR TO FULFIL THE WISHES OFYOUR PARENTS ALTHOUGH THEY OPPOSED THEMSELVES TO YOUR INCLINATIONS.BUT THIS IS FALSE REASONING. I CONFESS TO YOU MY FRIEND THAT I LOVEYOU AND THAT IN MY AIRY DREAMS OF FUTURITY YOU HAVE BEEN MY CONSTANTFRIEND AND COMPANION. BUT IT IS YOUR HAPPINESS I DESIRE AS WELL AS MYOWN WHEN I DECLARE TO YOU THAT OUR MARRIAGE WOULD RENDER ME ETERNALLYMISERABLE UNLESS IT WERE THE DICTATE OF YOUR OWN FREE CHOICE. EVEN NOWI WEEP TO THINK THAT BORNE DOWN AS YOU ARE BY THE CRUELLESTMISFORTUNES YOU MAY STIFLE BY THE WORD HONOUR ALL HOPE OF THATLOVE AND HAPPINESS WHICH WOULD ALONE RESTORE YOU TO YOURSELF. I WHOHAVE SO DISINTERESTED AN AFFECTION FOR YOU MAY INCREASE YOUR MISERIESTENFOLD BY BEING AN OBSTACLE TO YOUR WISHES. AH VICTOR BE ASSUREDTHAT YOUR COUSIN AND PLAYMATE HAS TOO SINCERE A LOVE FOR YOU NOT TO BEMADE MISERABLE BY THIS SUPPOSITION. BE HAPPY MY FRIEND AND IF YOUOBEY ME IN THIS ONE REQUEST REMAIN SATISFIED THAT NOTHING ON EARTHWILL HAVE THE POWER TO INTERRUPT MY TRANQUILLITY.DO NOT LET THIS LETTER DISTURB YOU DO NOT ANSWER TOMORROW OR THENEXT DAY OR EVEN UNTIL YOU COME IF IT WILL GIVE YOU PAIN. MY UNCLEWILL SEND ME NEWS OF YOUR HEALTH AND IF I SEE BUT ONE SMILE ON YOURLIPS WHEN WE MEET OCCASIONED BY THIS OR ANY OTHER EXERTION OF MINE ISHALL NEED NO OTHER HAPPINESS.ELIZABETH LAVENZA.GENEVA MAY TH THIS LETTER REVIVED IN MY MEMORY WHAT I HAD BEFORE FORGOTTEN THE THREAT OFTHE FIENDI WILL BE WITH YOU ON YOURWEDDINGNIGHT SUCH WAS MY SENTENCE AND ON THAT NIGHT WOULD THEDMON EMPLOY EVERY ART TO DESTROY ME AND TEAR ME FROM THE GLIMPSE OFHAPPINESS WHICH PROMISED PARTLY TO CONSOLE MY SUFFERINGS. ON THAT NIGHT HEHAD DETERMINED TO CONSUMMATE HIS CRIMES BY MY DEATH. WELL BE IT SO ADEADLY STRUGGLE WOULD THEN ASSUREDLY TAKE PLACE IN WHICH IF HE WEREVICTORIOUS I SHOULD BE AT PEACE AND HIS POWER OVER ME BE AT AN END. IF HEWERE VANQUISHED I SHOULD BE A FREE MAN. ALAS WHAT FREEDOM SUCH AS THEPEASANT ENJOYS WHEN HIS FAMILY HAVE BEEN MASSACRED BEFORE HIS EYES HISCOTTAGE BURNT HIS LANDS LAID WASTE AND HE IS TURNED ADRIFT HOMELESSPENNILESS AND ALONE BUT FREE. SUCH WOULD BE MY LIBERTY EXCEPT THAT IN MYELIZABETH I POSSESSED A TREASURE ALAS BALANCED BY THOSE HORRORS OFREMORSE AND GUILT WHICH WOULD PURSUE ME UNTIL DEATH.SWEET AND BELOVED ELIZABETH I READ AND REREAD HER LETTER AND SOMESOFTENED FEELINGS STOLE INTO MY HEART AND DARED TO WHISPER PARADISIACALDREAMS OF LOVE AND JOY BUT THE APPLE WAS ALREADY EATEN AND THEANGELS ARM BARED TO DRIVE ME FROM ALL HOPE. YET I WOULD DIE TO MAKEHER HAPPY. IF THE MONSTER EXECUTED HIS THREAT DEATH WAS INEVITABLE YETAGAIN I CONSIDERED WHETHER MY MARRIAGE WOULD HASTEN MY FATE. MYDESTRUCTION MIGHT INDEED ARRIVE A FEW MONTHS SOONER BUT IF MY TORTURERSHOULD SUSPECT THAT I POSTPONED IT INFLUENCED BY HIS MENACES HE WOULDSURELY FIND OTHER AND PERHAPS MORE DREADFUL MEANS OF REVENGE. HE HAD VOWEDTO BE WITH ME ON MY WEDDINGNIGHT YET HE DID NOT CONSIDER THATTHREAT AS BINDING HIM TO PEACE IN THE MEANTIME FOR AS IF TO SHOW ME THATHE WAS NOT YET SATIATED WITH BLOOD HE HAD MURDERED CLERVAL IMMEDIATELYAFTER THE ENUNCIATION OF HIS THREATS. I RESOLVED THEREFORE THAT IF MYIMMEDIATE UNION WITH MY COUSIN WOULD CONDUCE EITHER TO HERS OR MYFATHERS HAPPINESS MY ADVERSARYS DESIGNS AGAINST MY LIFESHOULD NOT RETARD IT A SINGLE HOUR.IN THIS STATE OF MIND I WROTE TO ELIZABETH. MY LETTER WAS CALM ANDAFFECTIONATE. I FEAR MY BELOVED GIRL I SAID LITTLE HAPPINESSREMAINS FOR US ON EARTH YET ALL THAT I MAY ONE DAY ENJOY IS CENTRED INYOU. CHASE AWAY YOUR IDLE FEARS TO YOU ALONE DO I CONSECRATE MY LIFEAND MY ENDEAVOURS FOR CONTENTMENT. I HAVE ONE SECRET ELIZABETH ADREADFUL ONE WHEN REVEALED TO YOU IT WILL CHILL YOUR FRAME WITHHORROR AND THEN FAR FROM BEING SURPRISED AT MY MISERY YOU WILL ONLYWONDER THAT I SURVIVE WHAT I HAVE ENDURED. I WILL CONFIDE THIS TALE OFMISERY AND TERROR TO YOU THE DAY AFTER OUR MARRIAGE SHALL TAKE PLACEFOR MY SWEET COUSIN THERE MUST BE PERFECT CONFIDENCE BETWEEN US. BUTUNTIL THEN I CONJURE YOU DO NOT MENTION OR ALLUDE TO IT. THIS I MOSTEARNESTLY ENTREAT AND I KNOW YOU WILL COMPLY.IN ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF ELIZABETHS LETTER WE RETURNEDTO GENEVA. THE SWEET GIRL WELCOMED ME WITH WARM AFFECTION YET TEARS WEREIN HER EYES AS SHE BEHELD MY EMACIATED FRAME AND FEVERISH CHEEKS. I SAW ACHANGE IN HER ALSO. SHE WAS THINNER AND HAD LOST MUCH OF THAT HEAVENLYVIVACITY THAT HAD BEFORE CHARMED ME BUT HER GENTLENESS AND SOFT LOOKS OFCOMPASSION MADE HER A MORE FIT COMPANION FOR ONE BLASTED AND MISERABLE AS IWAS.THE TRANQUILLITY WHICH I NOW ENJOYED DID NOT ENDURE. MEMORY BROUGHT MADNESSWITH IT AND WHEN I THOUGHT OF WHAT HAD PASSED A REAL INSANITY POSSESSEDME SOMETIMES I WAS FURIOUS AND BURNT WITH RAGE SOMETIMES LOW ANDDESPONDENT. I NEITHER SPOKE NOR LOOKED AT ANYONE BUT SAT MOTIONLESSBEWILDERED BY THE MULTITUDE OF MISERIES THAT OVERCAME ME.ELIZABETH ALONE HAD THE POWER TO DRAW ME FROM THESE FITS HER GENTLE VOICEWOULD SOOTHE ME WHEN TRANSPORTED BY PASSION AND INSPIRE ME WITH HUMANFEELINGS WHEN SUNK IN TORPOR. SHE WEPT WITH ME AND FOR ME. WHEN REASONRETURNED SHE WOULD REMONSTRATE AND ENDEAVOUR TO INSPIRE ME WITHRESIGNATION. AH IT IS WELL FOR THE UNFORTUNATE TO BE RESIGNED BUT FOR THEGUILTY THERE IS NO PEACE. THE AGONIES OF REMORSE POISON THE LUXURY THERE ISOTHERWISE SOMETIMES FOUND IN INDULGING THE EXCESS OF GRIEF.SOON AFTER MY ARRIVAL MY FATHER SPOKE OF MY IMMEDIATE MARRIAGE WITHELIZABETH. I REMAINED SILENT.HAVE YOU THEN SOME OTHER ATTACHMENTNONE ON EARTH. I LOVE ELIZABETH AND LOOK FORWARD TO OUR UNION WITHDELIGHT. LET THE DAY THEREFORE BE FIXED AND ON IT I WILL CONSECRATEMYSELF IN LIFE OR DEATH TO THE HAPPINESS OF MY COUSIN.MY DEAR VICTOR DO NOT SPEAK THUS. HEAVY MISFORTUNES HAVE BEFALLENUS BUT LET US ONLY CLING CLOSER TO WHAT REMAINS AND TRANSFER OUR LOVEFOR THOSE WHOM WE HAVE LOST TO THOSE WHO YET LIVE. OUR CIRCLE WILL BESMALL BUT BOUND CLOSE BY THE TIES OF AFFECTION AND MUTUAL MISFORTUNE.AND WHEN TIME SHALL HAVE SOFTENED YOUR DESPAIR NEW AND DEAR OBJECTS OFCARE WILL BE BORN TO REPLACE THOSE OF WHOM WE HAVE BEEN SO CRUELLYDEPRIVED.SUCH WERE THE LESSONS OF MY FATHER. BUT TO ME THE REMEMBRANCE OF THETHREAT RETURNED NOR CAN YOU WONDER THAT OMNIPOTENT AS THE FIEND HADYET BEEN IN HIS DEEDS OF BLOOD I SHOULD ALMOST REGARD HIM ASINVINCIBLE AND THAT WHEN HE HAD PRONOUNCED THE WORDS I SHALL BE WITHYOU ON YOUR WEDDINGNIGHT I SHOULD REGARD THE THREATENED FATE ASUNAVOIDABLE. BUT DEATH WAS NO EVIL TO ME IF THE LOSS OF ELIZABETH WEREBALANCED WITH IT AND I THEREFORE WITH A CONTENTED AND EVEN CHEERFULCOUNTENANCE AGREED WITH MY FATHER THAT IF MY COUSIN WOULD CONSENT THECEREMONY SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN TEN DAYS AND THUS PUT AS I IMAGINEDTHE SEAL TO MY FATE.GREAT GOD IF FOR ONE INSTANT I HAD THOUGHT WHAT MIGHT BE THE HELLISHINTENTION OF MY FIENDISH ADVERSARY I WOULD RATHER HAVE BANISHED MYSELFFOR EVER FROM MY NATIVE COUNTRY AND WANDERED A FRIENDLESS OUTCAST OVERTHE EARTH THAN HAVE CONSENTED TO THIS MISERABLE MARRIAGE. BUT AS IFPOSSESSED OF MAGIC POWERS THE MONSTER HAD BLINDED ME TO HIS REALINTENTIONS AND WHEN I THOUGHT THAT I HAD PREPARED ONLY MY OWN DEATH IHASTENED THAT OF A FAR DEARER VICTIM.AS THE PERIOD FIXED FOR OUR MARRIAGE DREW NEARER WHETHER FROM COWARDICE ORA PROPHETIC FEELING I FELT MY HEART SINK WITHIN ME. BUT I CONCEALED MYFEELINGS BY AN APPEARANCE OF HILARITY THAT BROUGHT SMILES AND JOY TO THECOUNTENANCE OF MY FATHER BUT HARDLY DECEIVED THE EVERWATCHFUL AND NICEREYE OF ELIZABETH. SHE LOOKED FORWARD TO OUR UNION WITH PLACID CONTENTMENTNOT UNMINGLED WITH A LITTLE FEAR WHICH PAST MISFORTUNES HAD IMPRESSEDTHAT WHAT NOW APPEARED CERTAIN AND TANGIBLE HAPPINESS MIGHT SOON DISSIPATEINTO AN AIRY DREAM AND LEAVE NO TRACE BUT DEEP AND EVERLASTING REGRET.PREPARATIONS WERE MADE FOR THE EVENT CONGRATULATORY VISITS WERE RECEIVEDAND ALL WORE A SMILING APPEARANCE. I SHUT UP AS WELL AS I COULD IN MY OWNHEART THE ANXIETY THAT PREYED THERE AND ENTERED WITH SEEMING EARNESTNESSINTO THE PLANS OF MY FATHER ALTHOUGH THEY MIGHT ONLY SERVE AS THEDECORATIONS OF MY TRAGEDY. THROUGH MY FATHERS EXERTIONS A PART OFTHE INHERITANCE OF ELIZABETH HAD BEEN RESTORED TO HER BY THE AUSTRIANGOVERNMENT. A SMALL POSSESSION ON THE SHORES OF COMO BELONGED TO HER. ITWAS AGREED THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER OUR UNION WE SHOULD PROCEED TO VILLALAVENZA AND SPEND OUR FIRST DAYS OF HAPPINESS BESIDE THE BEAUTIFUL LAKENEAR WHICH IT STOOD.IN THE MEANTIME I TOOK EVERY PRECAUTION TO DEFEND MY PERSON IN CASE THEFIEND SHOULD OPENLY ATTACK ME. I CARRIED PISTOLS AND A DAGGERCONSTANTLY ABOUT ME AND WAS EVER ON THE WATCH TO PREVENT ARTIFICE ANDBY THESE MEANS GAINED A GREATER DEGREE OF TRANQUILLITY. INDEED AS THEPERIOD APPROACHED THE THREAT APPEARED MORE AS A DELUSION NOT TO BEREGARDED AS WORTHY TO DISTURB MY PEACE WHILE THE HAPPINESS I HOPED FORIN MY MARRIAGE WORE A GREATER APPEARANCE OF CERTAINTY AS THE DAY FIXEDFOR ITS SOLEMNISATION DREW NEARER AND I HEARD IT CONTINUALLY SPOKEN OFAS AN OCCURRENCE WHICH NO ACCIDENT COULD POSSIBLY PREVENT.ELIZABETH SEEMED HAPPY MY TRANQUIL DEMEANOUR CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TOCALM HER MIND. BUT ON THE DAY THAT WAS TO FULFIL MY WISHES AND MYDESTINY SHE WAS MELANCHOLY AND A PRESENTIMENT OF EVIL PERVADED HERAND PERHAPS ALSO SHE THOUGHT OF THE DREADFUL SECRET WHICH I HADPROMISED TO REVEAL TO HER ON THE FOLLOWING DAY. MY FATHER WAS IN THEMEANTIME OVERJOYED AND IN THE BUSTLE OF PREPARATION ONLY RECOGNISED INTHE MELANCHOLY OF HIS NIECE THE DIFFIDENCE OF A BRIDE.AFTER THE CEREMONY WAS PERFORMED A LARGE PARTY ASSEMBLED AT MYFATHERS BUT IT WAS AGREED THAT ELIZABETH AND I SHOULD COMMENCE OURJOURNEY BY WATER SLEEPING THAT NIGHT AT EVIAN AND CONTINUING OURVOYAGE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY. THE DAY WAS FAIR THE WIND FAVOURABLEALL SMILED ON OUR NUPTIAL EMBARKATION.THOSE WERE THE LAST MOMENTS OF MY LIFE DURING WHICH I ENJOYED THEFEELING OF HAPPINESS. WE PASSED RAPIDLY ALONG THE SUN WAS HOT BUT WEWERE SHELTERED FROM ITS RAYS BY A KIND OF CANOPY WHILE WE ENJOYED THEBEAUTY OF THE SCENE SOMETIMES ON ONE SIDE OF THE LAKE WHERE WE SAWMONT SALVE THE PLEASANT BANKS OF MONTALGRE AND AT A DISTANCESURMOUNTING ALL THE BEAUTIFUL MONT BLANC AND THE ASSEMBLAGE OF SNOWYMOUNTAINS THAT IN VAIN ENDEAVOUR TO EMULATE HER SOMETIMES COASTING THEOPPOSITE BANKS WE SAW THE MIGHTY JURA OPPOSING ITS DARK SIDE TO THEAMBITION THAT WOULD QUIT ITS NATIVE COUNTRY AND AN ALMOSTINSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER TO THE INVADER WHO SHOULD WISH TO ENSLAVE IT.I TOOK THE HAND OF ELIZABETH. YOU ARE SORROWFUL MY LOVE. AH IFYOU KNEW WHAT I HAVE SUFFERED AND WHAT I MAY YET ENDURE YOU WOULDENDEAVOUR TO LET ME TASTE THE QUIET AND FREEDOM FROM DESPAIR THAT THISONE DAY AT LEAST PERMITS ME TO ENJOY.BE HAPPY MY DEAR VICTOR REPLIED ELIZABETH THERE IS I HOPENOTHING TO DISTRESS YOU AND BE ASSURED THAT IF A LIVELY JOY IS NOTPAINTED IN MY FACE MY HEART IS CONTENTED. SOMETHING WHISPERS TO MENOT TO DEPEND TOO MUCH ON THE PROSPECT THAT IS OPENED BEFORE US BUT IWILL NOT LISTEN TO SUCH A SINISTER VOICE. OBSERVE HOW FAST WE MOVEALONG AND HOW THE CLOUDS WHICH SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND SOMETIMES RISEABOVE THE DOME OF MONT BLANC RENDER THIS SCENE OF BEAUTY STILL MOREINTERESTING. LOOK ALSO AT THE INNUMERABLE FISH THAT ARE SWIMMING INTHE CLEAR WATERS WHERE WE CAN DISTINGUISH EVERY PEBBLE THAT LIES ATTHE BOTTOM. WHAT A DIVINE DAY HOW HAPPY AND SERENE ALL NATUREAPPEARSTHUS ELIZABETH ENDEAVOURED TO DIVERT HER THOUGHTS AND MINE FROM ALLREFLECTION UPON MELANCHOLY SUBJECTS. BUT HER TEMPER WAS FLUCTUATINGJOY FOR A FEW INSTANTS SHONE IN HER EYES BUT IT CONTINUALLY GAVE PLACETO DISTRACTION AND REVERIE.THE SUN SANK LOWER IN THE HEAVENS WE PASSED THE RIVER DRANCE ANDOBSERVED ITS PATH THROUGH THE CHASMS OF THE HIGHER AND THE GLENS OF THELOWER HILLS. THE ALPS HERE COME CLOSER TO THE LAKE AND WE APPROACHEDTHE AMPHITHEATRE OF MOUNTAINS WHICH FORMS ITS EASTERN BOUNDARY. THESPIRE OF EVIAN SHONE UNDER THE WOODS THAT SURROUNDED IT AND THE RANGEOF MOUNTAIN ABOVE MOUNTAIN BY WHICH IT WAS OVERHUNG.THE WIND WHICH HAD HITHERTO CARRIED US ALONG WITH AMAZING RAPIDITYSANK AT SUNSET TO A LIGHT BREEZE THE SOFT AIR JUST RUFFLED THE WATERAND CAUSED A PLEASANT MOTION AMONG THE TREES AS WE APPROACHED THESHORE FROM WHICH IT WAFTED THE MOST DELIGHTFUL SCENT OF FLOWERS ANDHAY. THE SUN SANK BENEATH THE HORIZON AS WE LANDED AND AS I TOUCHEDTHE SHORE I FELT THOSE CARES AND FEARS REVIVE WHICH SOON WERE TO CLASPME AND CLING TO ME FOR EVER.CHAPTER IT WAS EIGHT OCLOCK WHEN WE LANDED WE WALKED FOR A SHORT TIME ON THESHORE ENJOYING THE TRANSITORY LIGHT AND THEN RETIRED TO THE INN ANDCONTEMPLATED THE LOVELY SCENE OF WATERS WOODS AND MOUNTAINS OBSCUREDIN DARKNESS YET STILL DISPLAYING THEIR BLACK OUTLINES.THE WIND WHICH HAD FALLEN IN THE SOUTH NOW ROSE WITH GREAT VIOLENCEIN THE WEST. THE MOON HAD REACHED HER SUMMIT IN THE HEAVENS AND WASBEGINNING TO DESCEND THE CLOUDS SWEPT ACROSS IT SWIFTER THAN THEFLIGHT OF THE VULTURE AND DIMMED HER RAYS WHILE THE LAKE REFLECTED THESCENE OF THE BUSY HEAVENS RENDERED STILL BUSIER BY THE RESTLESS WAVESTHAT WERE BEGINNING TO RISE. SUDDENLY A HEAVY STORM OF RAIN DESCENDED.I HAD BEEN CALM DURING THE DAY BUT SO SOON AS NIGHT OBSCURED THESHAPES OF OBJECTS A THOUSAND FEARS AROSE IN MY MIND. I WAS ANXIOUSAND WATCHFUL WHILE MY RIGHT HAND GRASPED A PISTOL WHICH WAS HIDDEN INMY BOSOM EVERY SOUND TERRIFIED ME BUT I RESOLVED THAT I WOULD SELL MYLIFE DEARLY AND NOT SHRINK FROM THE CONFLICT UNTIL MY OWN LIFE OR THATOF MY ADVERSARY WAS EXTINGUISHED.ELIZABETH OBSERVED MY AGITATION FOR SOME TIME IN TIMID AND FEARFUL SILENCEBUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN MY GLANCE WHICH COMMUNICATED TERROR TO HER ANDTREMBLING SHE ASKED WHAT IS IT THAT AGITATES YOU MY DEAR VICTORWHAT IS IT YOU FEAROH PEACE PEACE MY LOVE REPLIED I THIS NIGHT ANDALL WILL BE SAFE BUT THIS NIGHT IS DREADFUL VERY DREADFUL.I PASSED AN HOUR IN THIS STATE OF MIND WHEN SUDDENLY I REFLECTED HOWFEARFUL THE COMBAT WHICH I MOMENTARILY EXPECTED WOULD BE TO MY WIFEAND I EARNESTLY ENTREATED HER TO RETIRE RESOLVING NOT TO JOIN HERUNTIL I HAD OBTAINED SOME KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE SITUATION OF MY ENEMY.SHE LEFT ME AND I CONTINUED SOME TIME WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PASSAGESOF THE HOUSE AND INSPECTING EVERY CORNER THAT MIGHT AFFORD A RETREAT TOMY ADVERSARY. BUT I DISCOVERED NO TRACE OF HIM AND WAS BEGINNING TOCONJECTURE THAT SOME FORTUNATE CHANCE HAD INTERVENED TO PREVENT THEEXECUTION OF HIS MENACES WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A SHRILL AND DREADFULSCREAM. IT CAME FROM THE ROOM INTO WHICH ELIZABETH HAD RETIRED. AS IHEARD IT THE WHOLE TRUTH RUSHED INTO MY MIND MY ARMS DROPPED THEMOTION OF EVERY MUSCLE AND FIBRE WAS SUSPENDED I COULD FEEL THE BLOODTRICKLING IN MY VEINS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES OF MY LIMBS. THISSTATE LASTED BUT FOR AN INSTANT THE SCREAM WAS REPEATED AND I RUSHEDINTO THE ROOM.GREAT GOD WHY DID I NOT THEN EXPIRE WHY AM I HERE TO RELATE THEDESTRUCTION OF THE BEST HOPE AND THE PUREST CREATURE ON EARTH SHE WASTHERE LIFELESS AND INANIMATE THROWN ACROSS THE BED HER HEAD HANGING DOWNAND HER PALE AND DISTORTED FEATURES HALF COVERED BY HER HAIR. EVERYWHERE ITURN I SEE THE SAME FIGUREHER BLOODLESS ARMS AND RELAXED FORM FLUNGBY THE MURDERER ON ITS BRIDAL BIER. COULD I BEHOLD THIS AND LIVE ALASLIFE IS OBSTINATE AND CLINGS CLOSEST WHERE IT IS MOST HATED. FOR A MOMENTONLY DID I LOSE RECOLLECTION I FELL SENSELESS ON THE GROUND.WHEN I RECOVERED I FOUND MYSELF SURROUNDED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE INN THEIRCOUNTENANCES EXPRESSED A BREATHLESS TERROR BUT THE HORROR OF OTHERSAPPEARED ONLY AS A MOCKERY A SHADOW OF THE FEELINGS THAT OPPRESSED ME. IESCAPED FROM THEM TO THE ROOM WHERE LAY THE BODY OF ELIZABETH MY LOVE MYWIFE SO LATELY LIVING SO DEAR SO WORTHY. SHE HAD BEEN MOVED FROM THEPOSTURE IN WHICH I HAD FIRST BEHELD HER AND NOW AS SHE LAY HER HEAD UPONHER ARM AND A HANDKERCHIEF THROWN ACROSS HER FACE AND NECK I MIGHT HAVESUPPOSED HER ASLEEP. I RUSHED TOWARDS HER AND EMBRACED HER WITH ARDOUR BUTTHE DEADLY LANGUOR AND COLDNESS OF THE LIMBS TOLD ME THAT WHAT I NOW HELDIN MY ARMS HAD CEASED TO BE THE ELIZABETH WHOM I HAD LOVED AND CHERISHED.THE MURDEROUS MARK OF THE FIENDS GRASP WAS ON HER NECK AND THEBREATH HAD CEASED TO ISSUE FROM HER LIPS.WHILE I STILL HUNG OVER HER IN THE AGONY OF DESPAIR I HAPPENED TO LOOK UP.THE WINDOWS OF THE ROOM HAD BEFORE BEEN DARKENED AND I FELT A KIND OFPANIC ON SEEING THE PALE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE MOON ILLUMINATE THE CHAMBER.THE SHUTTERS HAD BEEN THROWN BACK AND WITH A SENSATION OF HORROR NOT TO BEDESCRIBED I SAW AT THE OPEN WINDOW A FIGURE THE MOST HIDEOUS AND ABHORRED.A GRIN WAS ON THE FACE OF THE MONSTER HE SEEMED TO JEER AS WITH HISFIENDISH FINGER HE POINTED TOWARDS THE CORPSE OF MY WIFE. I RUSHED TOWARDSTHE WINDOW AND DRAWING A PISTOL FROM MY BOSOM FIRED BUT HE ELUDED MELEAPED FROM HIS STATION AND RUNNING WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHTNINGPLUNGED INTO THE LAKE.THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BROUGHT A CROWD INTO THE ROOM. I POINTED TOTHE SPOT WHERE HE HAD DISAPPEARED AND WE FOLLOWED THE TRACK WITHBOATS NETS WERE CAST BUT IN VAIN. AFTER PASSING SEVERAL HOURS WERETURNED HOPELESS MOST OF MY COMPANIONS BELIEVING IT TO HAVE BEEN AFORM CONJURED UP BY MY FANCY. AFTER HAVING LANDED THEY PROCEEDED TOSEARCH THE COUNTRY PARTIES GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AMONG THEWOODS AND VINES.I ATTEMPTED TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND PROCEEDED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THEHOUSE BUT MY HEAD WHIRLED ROUND MY STEPS WERE LIKE THOSE OF A DRUNKENMAN I FELL AT LAST IN A STATE OF UTTER EXHAUSTION A FILM COVERED MYEYES AND MY SKIN WAS PARCHED WITH THE HEAT OF FEVER. IN THIS STATE IWAS CARRIED BACK AND PLACED ON A BED HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HADHAPPENED MY EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM AS IF TO SEEK SOMETHING THATI HAD LOST.AFTER AN INTERVAL I AROSE AND AS IF BY INSTINCT CRAWLED INTO THE ROOMWHERE THE CORPSE OF MY BELOVED LAY. THERE WERE WOMEN WEEPING AROUND IHUNG OVER IT AND JOINED MY SAD TEARS TO THEIRS ALL THIS TIME NODISTINCT IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND BUT MY THOUGHTS RAMBLED TOVARIOUS SUBJECTS REFLECTING CONFUSEDLY ON MY MISFORTUNES AND THEIRCAUSE. I WAS BEWILDERED IN A CLOUD OF WONDER AND HORROR. THE DEATHOF WILLIAM THE EXECUTION OF JUSTINE THE MURDER OF CLERVAL AND LASTLYOF MY WIFE EVEN AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW NOT THAT MY ONLY REMAININGFRIENDS WERE SAFE FROM THE MALIGNITY OF THE FIEND MY FATHER EVEN NOWMIGHT BE WRITHING UNDER HIS GRASP AND ERNEST MIGHT BE DEAD AT HISFEET. THIS IDEA MADE ME SHUDDER AND RECALLED ME TO ACTION. I STARTEDUP AND RESOLVED TO RETURN TO GENEVA WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED.THERE WERE NO HORSES TO BE PROCURED AND I MUST RETURN BY THE LAKE BUT THEWIND WAS UNFAVOURABLE AND THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS. HOWEVER IT WASHARDLY MORNING AND I MIGHT REASONABLY HOPE TO ARRIVE BY NIGHT. I HIRED MENTO ROW AND TOOK AN OAR MYSELF FOR I HAD ALWAYS EXPERIENCED RELIEF FROMMENTAL TORMENT IN BODILY EXERCISE. BUT THE OVERFLOWING MISERY I NOW FELTAND THE EXCESS OF AGITATION THAT I ENDURED RENDERED ME INCAPABLE OF ANYEXERTION. I THREW DOWN THE OAR AND LEANING MY HEAD UPON MY HANDS GAVE WAYTO EVERY GLOOMY IDEA THAT AROSE. IF I LOOKED UP I SAW SCENES WHICH WEREFAMILIAR TO ME IN MY HAPPIER TIME AND WHICH I HAD CONTEMPLATED BUT THE DAYBEFORE IN THE COMPANY OF HER WHO WAS NOW BUT A SHADOW AND A RECOLLECTION.TEARS STREAMED FROM MY EYES. THE RAIN HAD CEASED FOR A MOMENT AND I SAWTHE FISH PLAY IN THE WATERS AS THEY HAD DONE A FEW HOURS BEFORE THEY HADTHEN BEEN OBSERVED BY ELIZABETH. NOTHING IS SO PAINFUL TO THE HUMAN MIND ASA GREAT AND SUDDEN CHANGE. THE SUN MIGHT SHINE OR THE CLOUDS MIGHT LOWERBUT NOTHING COULD APPEAR TO ME AS IT HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE. A FIEND HADSNATCHED FROM ME EVERY HOPE OF FUTURE HAPPINESS NO CREATURE HAD EVER BEENSO MISERABLE AS I WAS SO FRIGHTFUL AN EVENT IS SINGLE IN THE HISTORY OFMAN.BUT WHY SHOULD I DWELL UPON THE INCIDENTS THAT FOLLOWED THIS LASTOVERWHELMING EVENT MINE HAS BEEN A TALE OF HORRORS I HAVE REACHED THEIRACME AND WHAT I MUST NOW RELATE CAN BUT BE TEDIOUS TO YOU. KNOWTHAT ONE BY ONE MY FRIENDS WERE SNATCHED AWAY I WAS LEFT DESOLATE. MYOWN STRENGTH IS EXHAUSTED AND I MUST TELL IN A FEW WORDS WHAT REMAINS OFMY HIDEOUS NARRATION.I ARRIVED AT GENEVA. MY FATHER AND ERNEST YET LIVED BUT THE FORMER SUNKUNDER THE TIDINGS THAT I BORE. I SEE HIM NOW EXCELLENT AND VENERABLE OLDMAN HIS EYES WANDERED IN VACANCY FOR THEY HAD LOST THEIR CHARM AND THEIRDELIGHTHIS ELIZABETH HIS MORE THAN DAUGHTER WHOM HE DOTED ON WITHALL THAT AFFECTION WHICH A MAN FEELS WHO IN THE DECLINE OF LIFE HAVINGFEW AFFECTIONS CLINGS MORE EARNESTLY TO THOSE THAT REMAIN. CURSED CURSEDBE THE FIEND THAT BROUGHT MISERY ON HIS GREY HAIRS AND DOOMED HIM TO WASTEIN WRETCHEDNESS HE COULD NOT LIVE UNDER THE HORRORS THAT WERE ACCUMULATEDAROUND HIM THE SPRINGS OF EXISTENCE SUDDENLY GAVE WAY HE WAS UNABLE TORISE FROM HIS BED AND IN A FEW DAYS HE DIED IN MY ARMS.WHAT THEN BECAME OF ME I KNOW NOT I LOST SENSATION AND CHAINS ANDDARKNESS WERE THE ONLY OBJECTS THAT PRESSED UPON ME. SOMETIMESINDEED I DREAMT THAT I WANDERED IN FLOWERY MEADOWS AND PLEASANT VALESWITH THE FRIENDS OF MY YOUTH BUT I AWOKE AND FOUND MYSELF IN ADUNGEON. MELANCHOLY FOLLOWED BUT BY DEGREES I GAINED A CLEARCONCEPTION OF MY MISERIES AND SITUATION AND WAS THEN RELEASED FROM MYPRISON. FOR THEY HAD CALLED ME MAD AND DURING MANY MONTHS AS IUNDERSTOOD A SOLITARY CELL HAD BEEN MY HABITATION.LIBERTY HOWEVER HAD BEEN A USELESS GIFT TO ME HAD I NOT AS IAWAKENED TO REASON AT THE SAME TIME AWAKENED TO REVENGE. AS THEMEMORY OF PAST MISFORTUNES PRESSED UPON ME I BEGAN TO REFLECT ON THEIRCAUSETHE MONSTER WHOM I HAD CREATED THE MISERABLE DMON WHOM I HADSENT ABROAD INTO THE WORLD FOR MY DESTRUCTION. I WAS POSSESSED BY AMADDENING RAGE WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM AND DESIRED AND ARDENTLY PRAYEDTHAT I MIGHT HAVE HIM WITHIN MY GRASP TO WREAK A GREAT AND SIGNALREVENGE ON HIS CURSED HEAD.NOR DID MY HATE LONG CONFINE ITSELF TO USELESS WISHES I BEGAN TOREFLECT ON THE BEST MEANS OF SECURING HIM AND FOR THIS PURPOSE ABOUTA MONTH AFTER MY RELEASE I REPAIRED TO A CRIMINAL JUDGE IN THE TOWNAND TOLD HIM THAT I HAD AN ACCUSATION TO MAKE THAT I KNEW THEDESTROYER OF MY FAMILY AND THAT I REQUIRED HIM TO EXERT HIS WHOLEAUTHORITY FOR THE APPREHENSION OF THE MURDERER.THE MAGISTRATE LISTENED TO ME WITH ATTENTION AND KINDNESS. BEASSURED SIR SAID HE NO PAINS OR EXERTIONS ON MY PART SHALLBE SPARED TO DISCOVER THE VILLAIN.I THANK YOU REPLIED I LISTEN THEREFORE TO THEDEPOSITION THAT I HAVE TO MAKE. IT IS INDEED A TALE SO STRANGE THAT ISHOULD FEAR YOU WOULD NOT CREDIT IT WERE THERE NOT SOMETHING IN TRUTHWHICH HOWEVER WONDERFUL FORCES CONVICTION. THE STORY IS TOO CONNECTED TOBE MISTAKEN FOR A DREAM AND I HAVE NO MOTIVE FOR FALSEHOOD. MYMANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE BUT CALM I HAD FORMED IN MYOWN HEART A RESOLUTION TO PURSUE MY DESTROYER TO DEATH AND THIS PURPOSEQUIETED MY AGONY AND FOR AN INTERVAL RECONCILED ME TO LIFE. I NOW RELATEDMY HISTORY BRIEFLY BUT WITH FIRMNESS AND PRECISION MARKING THE DATES WITHACCURACY AND NEVER DEVIATING INTO INVECTIVE OR EXCLAMATION.THE MAGISTRATE APPEARED AT FIRST PERFECTLY INCREDULOUS BUT AS I CONTINUEDHE BECAME MORE ATTENTIVE AND INTERESTED I SAW HIM SOMETIMES SHUDDER WITHHORROR AT OTHERS A LIVELY SURPRISE UNMINGLED WITH DISBELIEF WAS PAINTEDON HIS COUNTENANCE.WHEN I HAD CONCLUDED MY NARRATION I SAID THIS IS THE BEING WHOM IACCUSE AND FOR WHOSE SEIZURE AND PUNISHMENT I CALL UPON YOU TO EXERT YOURWHOLE POWER. IT IS YOUR DUTY AS A MAGISTRATE AND I BELIEVE AND HOPE THATYOUR FEELINGS AS A MAN WILL NOT REVOLT FROM THE EXECUTION OF THOSEFUNCTIONS ON THIS OCCASION.THIS ADDRESS CAUSED A CONSIDERABLE CHANGE IN THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF MY OWNAUDITOR. HE HAD HEARD MY STORY WITH THAT HALF KIND OF BELIEF THAT IS GIVENTO A TALE OF SPIRITS AND SUPERNATURAL EVENTS BUT WHEN HE WAS CALLED UPONTO ACT OFFICIALLY IN CONSEQUENCE THE WHOLE TIDE OF HIS INCREDULITYRETURNED. HE HOWEVER ANSWERED MILDLY I WOULD WILLINGLY AFFORD YOUEVERY AID IN YOUR PURSUIT BUT THE CREATURE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK APPEARS TOHAVE POWERS WHICH WOULD PUT ALL MY EXERTIONS TO DEFIANCE. WHO CAN FOLLOW ANANIMAL WHICH CAN TRAVERSE THE SEA OF ICE AND INHABIT CAVES AND DENS WHERENO MAN WOULD VENTURE TO INTRUDE BESIDES SOME MONTHS HAVE ELAPSED SINCETHE COMMISSION OF HIS CRIMES AND NO ONE CAN CONJECTURE TO WHAT PLACE HEHAS WANDERED OR WHAT REGION HE MAY NOW INHABIT.I DO NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOVERS NEAR THE SPOT WHICH I INHABIT AND IFHE HAS INDEED TAKEN REFUGE IN THE ALPS HE MAY BE HUNTED LIKE THE CHAMOISAND DESTROYED AS A BEAST OF PREY. BUT I PERCEIVE YOUR THOUGHTS YOU DO NOTCREDIT MY NARRATIVE AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE MY ENEMY WITH THEPUNISHMENT WHICH IS HIS DESERT.AS I SPOKE RAGE SPARKLED IN MY EYES THE MAGISTRATE WAS INTIMIDATED.YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID HE. I WILL EXERT MYSELF AND IFIT IS IN MY POWER TO SEIZE THE MONSTER BE ASSURED THAT HE SHALL SUFFERPUNISHMENT PROPORTIONATE TO HIS CRIMES. BUT I FEAR FROM WHAT YOU HAVEYOURSELF DESCRIBED TO BE HIS PROPERTIES THAT THIS WILL PROVEIMPRACTICABLE AND THUS WHILE EVERY PROPER MEASURE IS PURSUED YOU SHOULDMAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DISAPPOINTMENT.THAT CANNOT BE BUT ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL BE OF LITTLE AVAIL. MYREVENGE IS OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YET WHILE I ALLOW IT TO BE A VICE ICONFESS THAT IT IS THE DEVOURING AND ONLY PASSION OF MY SOUL. MY RAGEIS UNSPEAKABLE WHEN I REFLECT THAT THE MURDERER WHOM I HAVE TURNEDLOOSE UPON SOCIETY STILL EXISTS. YOU REFUSE MY JUST DEMAND I HAVEBUT ONE RESOURCE AND I DEVOTE MYSELF EITHER IN MY LIFE OR DEATH TOHIS DESTRUCTION.I TREMBLED WITH EXCESS OF AGITATION AS I SAID THIS THERE WAS A FRENZYIN MY MANNER AND SOMETHING I DOUBT NOT OF THAT HAUGHTY FIERCENESSWHICH THE MARTYRS OF OLD ARE SAID TO HAVE POSSESSED. BUT TO A GENEVANMAGISTRATE WHOSE MIND WAS OCCUPIED BY FAR OTHER IDEAS THAN THOSE OFDEVOTION AND HEROISM THIS ELEVATION OF MIND HAD MUCH THE APPEARANCE OFMADNESS. HE ENDEAVOURED TO SOOTHE ME AS A NURSE DOES A CHILD ANDREVERTED TO MY TALE AS THE EFFECTS OF DELIRIUM.MAN I CRIED HOW IGNORANT ART THOU IN THY PRIDE OFWISDOM CEASE YOU KNOW NOT WHAT IT IS YOU SAY.I BROKE FROM THE HOUSE ANGRY AND DISTURBED AND RETIRED TO MEDITATE ONSOME OTHER MODE OF ACTION.CHAPTER MY PRESENT SITUATION WAS ONE IN WHICH ALL VOLUNTARY THOUGHT WASSWALLOWED UP AND LOST. I WAS HURRIED AWAY BY FURY REVENGE ALONEENDOWED ME WITH STRENGTH AND COMPOSURE IT MOULDED MY FEELINGS ANDALLOWED ME TO BE CALCULATING AND CALM AT PERIODS WHEN OTHERWISEDELIRIUM OR DEATH WOULD HAVE BEEN MY PORTION.MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOR EVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN IWAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAMEHATEFUL. I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A SUM OF MONEY TOGETHER WITH A FEW JEWELSWHICH HAD BELONGED TO MY MOTHER AND DEPARTED.AND NOW MY WANDERINGS BEGAN WHICH ARE TO CEASE BUT WITH LIFE. I HAVETRAVERSED A VAST PORTION OF THE EARTH AND HAVE ENDURED ALL THE HARDSHIPSWHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET. HOW IHAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW MANY TIMES HAVE I STRETCHED MY FAILING LIMBS UPONTHE SANDY PLAIN AND PRAYED FOR DEATH. BUT REVENGE KEPT ME ALIVE I DAREDNOT DIE AND LEAVE MY ADVERSARY IN BEING.WHEN I QUITTED GENEVA MY FIRST LABOUR WAS TO GAIN SOME CLUE BY WHICH IMIGHT TRACE THE STEPS OF MY FIENDISH ENEMY. BUT MY PLAN WAS UNSETTLEDAND I WANDERED MANY HOURS ROUND THE CONFINES OF THE TOWN UNCERTAINWHAT PATH I SHOULD PURSUE. AS NIGHT APPROACHED I FOUND MYSELF AT THEENTRANCE OF THE CEMETERY WHERE WILLIAM ELIZABETH AND MY FATHERREPOSED. I ENTERED IT AND APPROACHED THE TOMB WHICH MARKED THEIRGRAVES. EVERYTHING WAS SILENT EXCEPT THE LEAVES OF THE TREES WHICHWERE GENTLY AGITATED BY THE WIND THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY DARK AND THESCENE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLEMN AND AFFECTING EVEN TO AN UNINTERESTEDOBSERVER. THE SPIRITS OF THE DEPARTED SEEMED TO FLIT AROUND AND TOCAST A SHADOW WHICH WAS FELT BUT NOT SEEN AROUND THE HEAD OF THEMOURNER.THE DEEP GRIEF WHICH THIS SCENE HAD AT FIRST EXCITED QUICKLY GAVE WAY TORAGE AND DESPAIR. THEY WERE DEAD AND I LIVED THEIR MURDERER ALSO LIVEDAND TO DESTROY HIM I MUST DRAG OUT MY WEARY EXISTENCE. I KNELT ON THE GRASSAND KISSED THE EARTH AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS EXCLAIMED BY THESACRED EARTH ON WHICH I KNEEL BY THE SHADES THAT WANDER NEAR ME BY THEDEEP AND ETERNAL GRIEF THAT I FEEL I SWEAR AND BY THEE O NIGHT AND THESPIRITS THAT PRESIDE OVER THEE TO PURSUE THE DMON WHO CAUSED THIS MISERYUNTIL HE OR I SHALL PERISH IN MORTAL CONFLICT. FOR THIS PURPOSE I WILLPRESERVE MY LIFE TO EXECUTE THIS DEAR REVENGE WILL I AGAIN BEHOLD THE SUNAND TREAD THE GREEN HERBAGE OF EARTH WHICH OTHERWISE SHOULD VANISH FROM MYEYES FOR EVER. AND I CALL ON YOU SPIRITS OF THE DEAD AND ON YOU WANDERINGMINISTERS OF VENGEANCE TO AID AND CONDUCT ME IN MY WORK. LET THE CURSEDAND HELLISH MONSTER DRINK DEEP OF AGONY LET HIM FEEL THE DESPAIR THAT NOWTORMENTS ME.I HAD BEGUN MY ADJURATION WITH SOLEMNITY AND AN AWE WHICH ALMOST ASSURED METHAT THE SHADES OF MY MURDERED FRIENDS HEARD AND APPROVED MY DEVOTION BUTTHE FURIES POSSESSED ME AS I CONCLUDED AND RAGE CHOKED MY UTTERANCE.I WAS ANSWERED THROUGH THE STILLNESS OF NIGHT BY A LOUD AND FIENDISHLAUGH. IT RANG ON MY EARS LONG AND HEAVILY THE MOUNTAINS REECHOEDIT AND I FELT AS IF ALL HELL SURROUNDED ME WITH MOCKERY AND LAUGHTER.SURELY IN THAT MOMENT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN POSSESSED BY FRENZY AND HAVEDESTROYED MY MISERABLE EXISTENCE BUT THAT MY VOW WAS HEARD AND THAT IWAS RESERVED FOR VENGEANCE. THE LAUGHTER DIED AWAY WHEN A WELLKNOWNAND ABHORRED VOICE APPARENTLY CLOSE TO MY EAR ADDRESSED ME IN ANAUDIBLE WHISPER I AM SATISFIED MISERABLE WRETCH YOU HAVEDETERMINED TO LIVE AND I AM SATISFIED.I DARTED TOWARDS THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE SOUND PROCEEDED BUT THE DEVILELUDED MY GRASP. SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONEFULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THANMORTAL SPEED.I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK. GUIDED BY ASLIGHT CLUE I FOLLOWED THE WINDINGS OF THE RHONE BUT VAINLY. THEBLUE MEDITERRANEAN APPEARED AND BY A STRANGE CHANCE I SAW THE FIENDENTER BY NIGHT AND HIDE HIMSELF IN A VESSEL BOUND FOR THE BLACK SEA. ITOOK MY PASSAGE IN THE SAME SHIP BUT HE ESCAPED I KNOW NOT HOW.AMIDST THE WILDS OF TARTARY AND RUSSIA ALTHOUGH HE STILL EVADED ME IHAVE EVER FOLLOWED IN HIS TRACK. SOMETIMES THE PEASANTS SCARED BYTHIS HORRID APPARITION INFORMED ME OF HIS PATH SOMETIMES HE HIMSELFWHO FEARED THAT IF I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM I SHOULD DESPAIR AND DIELEFT SOME MARK TO GUIDE ME. THE SNOWS DESCENDED ON MY HEAD AND I SAWTHE PRINT OF HIS HUGE STEP ON THE WHITE PLAIN. TO YOU FIRST ENTERINGON LIFE TO WHOM CARE IS NEW AND AGONY UNKNOWN HOW CAN YOU UNDERSTANDWHAT I HAVE FELT AND STILL FEEL COLD WANT AND FATIGUE WERE THELEAST PAINS WHICH I WAS DESTINED TO ENDURE I WAS CURSED BY SOME DEVILAND CARRIED ABOUT WITH ME MY ETERNAL HELL YET STILL A SPIRIT OF GOODFOLLOWED AND DIRECTED MY STEPS AND WHEN I MOST MURMURED WOULD SUDDENLYEXTRICATE ME FROM SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES. SOMETIMESWHEN NATURE OVERCOME BY HUNGER SANK UNDER THE EXHAUSTION A REPASTWAS PREPARED FOR ME IN THE DESERT THAT RESTORED AND INSPIRITED ME. THEFARE WAS INDEED COARSE SUCH AS THE PEASANTS OF THE COUNTRY ATE BUTI WILL NOT DOUBT THAT IT WAS SET THERE BY THE SPIRITS THAT I HADINVOKED TO AID ME. OFTEN WHEN ALL WAS DRY THE HEAVENS CLOUDLESS ANDI WAS PARCHED BY THIRST A SLIGHT CLOUD WOULD BEDIM THE SKY SHED THEFEW DROPS THAT REVIVED ME AND VANISH.I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DMONGENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THECOUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED. IN OTHER PLACES HUMAN BEINGS WERE SELDOMSEEN AND I GENERALLY SUBSISTED ON THE WILD ANIMALS THAT CROSSED MYPATH. I HAD MONEY WITH ME AND GAINED THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE VILLAGERSBY DISTRIBUTING IT OR I BROUGHT WITH ME SOME FOOD THAT I HAD KILLEDWHICH AFTER TAKING A SMALL PART I ALWAYS PRESENTED TO THOSE WHO HADPROVIDED ME WITH FIRE AND UTENSILS FOR COOKING.MY LIFE AS IT PASSED THUS WAS INDEED HATEFUL TO ME AND IT WAS DURINGSLEEP ALONE THAT I COULD TASTE JOY. O BLESSED SLEEP OFTEN WHEN MOSTMISERABLE I SANK TO REPOSE AND MY DREAMS LULLED ME EVEN TO RAPTURE. THESPIRITS THAT GUARDED ME HAD PROVIDED THESE MOMENTS OR RATHER HOURS OFHAPPINESS THAT I MIGHT RETAIN STRENGTH TO FULFIL MY PILGRIMAGE. DEPRIVED OFTHIS RESPITE I SHOULD HAVE SUNK UNDER MY HARDSHIPS. DURING THE DAY I WASSUSTAINED AND INSPIRITED BY THE HOPE OF NIGHT FOR IN SLEEP I SAW MYFRIENDS MY WIFE AND MY BELOVED COUNTRY AGAIN I SAW THE BENEVOLENTCOUNTENANCE OF MY FATHER HEARD THE SILVER TONES OF MY ELIZABETHSVOICE AND BEHELD CLERVAL ENJOYING HEALTH AND YOUTH. OFTEN WHEN WEARIED BYA TOILSOME MARCH I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I WAS DREAMING UNTIL NIGHT SHOULDCOME AND THAT I SHOULD THEN ENJOY REALITY IN THE ARMS OF MY DEARESTFRIENDS. WHAT AGONISING FONDNESS DID I FEEL FOR THEM HOW DID I CLING TOTHEIR DEAR FORMS AS SOMETIMES THEY HAUNTED EVEN MY WAKING HOURS ANDPERSUADE MYSELF THAT THEY STILL LIVED AT SUCH MOMENTS VENGEANCE THATBURNED WITHIN ME DIED IN MY HEART AND I PURSUED MY PATH TOWARDS THEDESTRUCTION OF THE DMON MORE AS A TASK ENJOINED BY HEAVEN AS THEMECHANICAL IMPULSE OF SOME POWER OF WHICH I WAS UNCONSCIOUS THAN AS THEARDENT DESIRE OF MY SOUL.WHAT HIS FEELINGS WERE WHOM I PURSUED I CANNOT KNOW. SOMETIMES INDEED HELEFT MARKS IN WRITING ON THE BARKS OF THE TREES OR CUT IN STONE THAT GUIDEDME AND INSTIGATED MY FURY. MY REIGN IS NOT YETOVERTHESE WORDS WERE LEGIBLE IN ONE OF THESEINSCRIPTIONSYOU LIVE AND MY POWER IS COMPLETE. FOLLOW ME ISEEK THE EVERLASTING ICES OF THE NORTH WHERE YOU WILL FEEL THE MISERY OFCOLD AND FROST TO WHICH I AM IMPASSIVE. YOU WILL FIND NEAR THIS PLACE IFYOU FOLLOW NOT TOO TARDILY A DEAD HARE EAT AND BE REFRESHED. COME ON MYENEMY WE HAVE YET TO WRESTLE FOR OUR LIVES BUT MANY HARD AND MISERABLEHOURS MUST YOU ENDURE UNTIL THAT PERIOD SHALL ARRIVE.SCOFFING DEVIL AGAIN DO I VOW VENGEANCE AGAIN DO I DEVOTE THEEMISERABLE FIEND TO TORTURE AND DEATH. NEVER WILL I GIVE UP MY SEARCHUNTIL HE OR I PERISH AND THEN WITH WHAT ECSTASY SHALL I JOIN MYELIZABETH AND MY DEPARTED FRIENDS WHO EVEN NOW PREPARE FOR ME THEREWARD OF MY TEDIOUS TOIL AND HORRIBLE PILGRIMAGEAS I STILL PURSUED MY JOURNEY TO THE NORTHWARD THE SNOWS THICKENED AND THECOLD INCREASED IN A DEGREE ALMOST TOO SEVERE TO SUPPORT. THE PEASANTS WERESHUT UP IN THEIR HOVELS AND ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDY VENTURED FORTH TOSEIZE THE ANIMALS WHOM STARVATION HAD FORCED FROM THEIR HIDINGPLACES TOSEEK FOR PREY. THE RIVERS WERE COVERED WITH ICE AND NO FISH COULD BEPROCURED AND THUS I WAS CUT OFF FROM MY CHIEF ARTICLE OF MAINTENANCE.THE TRIUMPH OF MY ENEMY INCREASED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MY LABOURS. ONEINSCRIPTION THAT HE LEFT WAS IN THESE WORDS PREPARE YOUR TOILSONLY BEGIN WRAP YOURSELF IN FURS AND PROVIDE FOOD FOR WE SHALL SOON ENTERUPON A JOURNEY WHERE YOUR SUFFERINGS WILL SATISFY MY EVERLASTINGHATRED.MY COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE WERE INVIGORATED BY THESE SCOFFING WORDS IRESOLVED NOT TO FAIL IN MY PURPOSE AND CALLING ON HEAVEN TO SUPPORTME I CONTINUED WITH UNABATED FERVOUR TO TRAVERSE IMMENSE DESERTSUNTIL THE OCEAN APPEARED AT A DISTANCE AND FORMED THE UTMOST BOUNDARYOF THE HORIZON. OH HOW UNLIKE IT WAS TO THE BLUE SEASONS OF THESOUTH COVERED WITH ICE IT WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM LAND BYITS SUPERIOR WILDNESS AND RUGGEDNESS. THE GREEKS WEPT FOR JOY WHENTHEY BEHELD THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM THE HILLS OF ASIA AND HAILED WITHRAPTURE THE BOUNDARY OF THEIR TOILS. I DID NOT WEEP BUT I KNELT DOWNAND WITH A FULL HEART THANKED MY GUIDING SPIRIT FOR CONDUCTING ME INSAFETY TO THE PLACE WHERE I HOPED NOTWITHSTANDING MY ADVERSARYS GIBETO MEET AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM.SOME WEEKS BEFORE THIS PERIOD I HAD PROCURED A SLEDGE AND DOGS AND THUSTRAVERSED THE SNOWS WITH INCONCEIVABLE SPEED. I KNOW NOT WHETHER THEFIEND POSSESSED THE SAME ADVANTAGES BUT I FOUND THAT AS BEFORE I HADDAILY LOST GROUND IN THE PURSUIT I NOW GAINED ON HIM SO MUCH SO THATWHEN I FIRST SAW THE OCEAN HE WAS BUT ONE DAYS JOURNEY IN ADVANCE ANDI HOPED TO INTERCEPT HIM BEFORE HE SHOULD REACH THE BEACH. WITH NEWCOURAGE THEREFORE I PRESSED ON AND IN TWO DAYS ARRIVED AT A WRETCHEDHAMLET ON THE SEASHORE. I INQUIRED OF THE INHABITANTS CONCERNING THEFIEND AND GAINED ACCURATE INFORMATION. A GIGANTIC MONSTER THEY SAIDHAD ARRIVED THE NIGHT BEFORE ARMED WITH A GUN AND MANY PISTOLSPUTTING TO FLIGHT THE INHABITANTS OF A SOLITARY COTTAGE THROUGH FEAR OFHIS TERRIFIC APPEARANCE. HE HAD CARRIED OFF THEIR STORE OF WINTERFOOD AND PLACING IT IN A SLEDGE TO DRAW WHICH HE HAD SEIZED ON ANUMEROUS DROVE OF TRAINED DOGS HE HAD HARNESSED THEM AND THE SAMENIGHT TO THE JOY OF THE HORRORSTRUCK VILLAGERS HAD PURSUED HISJOURNEY ACROSS THE SEA IN A DIRECTION THAT LED TO NO LAND AND THEYCONJECTURED THAT HE MUST SPEEDILY BE DESTROYED BY THE BREAKING OF THEICE OR FROZEN BY THE ETERNAL FROSTS.ON HEARING THIS INFORMATION I SUFFERED A TEMPORARY ACCESS OF DESPAIR.HE HAD ESCAPED ME AND I MUST COMMENCE A DESTRUCTIVE AND ALMOST ENDLESSJOURNEY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINOUS ICES OF THE OCEAN AMIDST COLD THAT FEWOF THE INHABITANTS COULD LONG ENDURE AND WHICH I THE NATIVE OF AGENIAL AND SUNNY CLIMATE COULD NOT HOPE TO SURVIVE. YET AT THE IDEATHAT THE FIEND SHOULD LIVE AND BE TRIUMPHANT MY RAGE AND VENGEANCERETURNED AND LIKE A MIGHTY TIDE OVERWHELMED EVERY OTHER FEELING.AFTER A SLIGHT REPOSE DURING WHICH THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD HOVEREDROUND AND INSTIGATED ME TO TOIL AND REVENGE I PREPARED FOR MY JOURNEY.I EXCHANGED MY LANDSLEDGE FOR ONE FASHIONED FOR THE INEQUALITIES OFTHE FROZEN OCEAN AND PURCHASING A PLENTIFUL STOCK OF PROVISIONS IDEPARTED FROM LAND.I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDUREDMISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT OF A JUST RETRIBUTIONBURNING WITHIN MY HEART COULD HAVE ENABLED ME TO SUPPORT. IMMENSE ANDRUGGED MOUNTAINS OF ICE OFTEN BARRED UP MY PASSAGE AND I OFTEN HEARDTHE THUNDER OF THE GROUND SEA WHICH THREATENED MY DESTRUCTION. BUTAGAIN THE FROST CAME AND MADE THE PATHS OF THE SEA SECURE.BY THE QUANTITY OF PROVISION WHICH I HAD CONSUMED I SHOULD GUESS THATI HAD PASSED THREE WEEKS IN THIS JOURNEY AND THE CONTINUAL PROTRACTIONOF HOPE RETURNING BACK UPON THE HEART OFTEN WRUNG BITTER DROPS OFDESPONDENCY AND GRIEF FROM MY EYES. DESPAIR HAD INDEED ALMOST SECUREDHER PREY AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK BENEATH THIS MISERY. ONCE AFTERTHE POOR ANIMALS THAT CONVEYED ME HAD WITH INCREDIBLE TOIL GAINED THESUMMIT OF A SLOPING ICE MOUNTAIN AND ONE SINKING UNDER HIS FATIGUEDIED I VIEWED THE EXPANSE BEFORE ME WITH ANGUISH WHEN SUDDENLY MY EYECAUGHT A DARK SPECK UPON THE DUSKY PLAIN. I STRAINED MY SIGHT TODISCOVER WHAT IT COULD BE AND UTTERED A WILD CRY OF ECSTASY WHEN IDISTINGUISHED A SLEDGE AND THE DISTORTED PROPORTIONS OF A WELLKNOWNFORM WITHIN. OH WITH WHAT A BURNING GUSH DID HOPE REVISIT MY HEARTWARM TEARS FILLED MY EYES WHICH I HASTILY WIPED AWAY THAT THEY MIGHTNOT INTERCEPT THE VIEW I HAD OF THE DMON BUT STILL MY SIGHT WASDIMMED BY THE BURNING DROPS UNTIL GIVING WAY TO THE EMOTIONS THATOPPRESSED ME I WEPT ALOUD.BUT THIS WAS NOT THE TIME FOR DELAY I DISENCUMBERED THE DOGS OF THEIRDEAD COMPANION GAVE THEM A PLENTIFUL PORTION OF FOOD AND AFTER ANHOURS REST WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND YET WHICH WAS BITTERLYIRKSOME TO ME I CONTINUED MY ROUTE. THE SLEDGE WAS STILL VISIBLE NORDID I AGAIN LOSE SIGHT OF IT EXCEPT AT THE MOMENTS WHEN FOR A SHORTTIME SOME ICEROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS. I INDEEDPERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY IBEHELD MY ENEMY AT NO MORE THAN A MILE DISTANT MY HEART BOUNDED WITHINME.BUT NOW WHEN I APPEARED ALMOST WITHIN GRASP OF MY FOE MY HOPES WERESUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED AND I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM MORE UTTERLY THAN I HADEVER DONE BEFORE. A GROUND SEA WAS HEARD THE THUNDER OF ITS PROGRESS ASTHE WATERS ROLLED AND SWELLED BENEATH ME BECAME EVERY MOMENT MORE OMINOUSAND TERRIFIC. I PRESSED ON BUT IN VAIN. THE WIND AROSE THE SEA ROAREDAND AS WITH THE MIGHTY SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE IT SPLIT AND CRACKED WITH ATREMENDOUS AND OVERWHELMING SOUND. THE WORK WAS SOON FINISHED IN A FEWMINUTES A TUMULTUOUS SEA ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND MY ENEMY AND I WAS LEFTDRIFTING ON A SCATTERED PIECE OF ICE THAT WAS CONTINUALLY LESSENING ANDTHUS PREPARING FOR ME A HIDEOUS DEATH.IN THIS MANNER MANY APPALLING HOURS PASSED SEVERAL OF MY DOGS DIED AND IMYSELF WAS ABOUT TO SINK UNDER THE ACCUMULATION OF DISTRESS WHEN I SAW YOURVESSEL RIDING AT ANCHOR AND HOLDING FORTH TO ME HOPES OF SUCCOUR AND LIFE.I HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT VESSELS EVER CAME SO FAR NORTH AND WAS ASTOUNDEDAT THE SIGHT. I QUICKLY DESTROYED PART OF MY SLEDGE TO CONSTRUCT OARS ANDBY THESE MEANS WAS ENABLED WITH INFINITE FATIGUE TO MOVE MY ICE RAFT INTHE DIRECTION OF YOUR SHIP. I HAD DETERMINED IF YOU WERE GOING SOUTHWARDSSTILL TO TRUST MYSELF TO THE MERCY OF THE SEAS RATHER THAN ABANDON MYPURPOSE. I HOPED TO INDUCE YOU TO GRANT ME A BOAT WITH WHICH I COULD PURSUEMY ENEMY. BUT YOUR DIRECTION WAS NORTHWARDS. YOU TOOK ME ON BOARD WHEN MYVIGOUR WAS EXHAUSTED AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK UNDER MY MULTIPLIEDHARDSHIPS INTO A DEATH WHICH I STILL DREAD FOR MY TASK IS UNFULFILLED.OH WHEN WILL MY GUIDING SPIRIT IN CONDUCTING ME TO THE DMON ALLOWME THE REST I SO MUCH DESIRE OR MUST I DIE AND HE YET LIVE IF I DOSWEAR TO ME WALTON THAT HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE THAT YOU WILL SEEK HIMAND SATISFY MY VENGEANCE IN HIS DEATH. AND DO I DARE TO ASK OF YOU TOUNDERTAKE MY PILGRIMAGE TO ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS THAT I HAVE UNDERGONENO I AM NOT SO SELFISH. YET WHEN I AM DEAD IF HE SHOULD APPEAR IFTHE MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIM TO YOU SWEAR THAT HESHALL NOT LIVESWEAR THAT HE SHALL NOT TRIUMPH OVER MY ACCUMULATEDWOES AND SURVIVE TO ADD TO THE LIST OF HIS DARK CRIMES. HE IS ELOQUENTAND PERSUASIVE AND ONCE HIS WORDS HAD EVEN POWER OVER MY HEART BUTTRUST HIM NOT. HIS SOUL IS AS HELLISH AS HIS FORM FULL OF TREACHERYAND FIENDLIKE MALICE. HEAR HIM NOT CALL ON THE NAMES OF WILLIAMJUSTINE CLERVAL ELIZABETH MY FATHER AND OF THE WRETCHED VICTOR ANDTHRUST YOUR SWORD INTO HIS HEART. I WILL HOVER NEAR AND DIRECT THESTEEL ARIGHT.WALTON IN CONTINUATION.AUGUST TH .YOU HAVE READ THIS STRANGE AND TERRIFIC STORY MARGARET AND DO YOU NOTFEEL YOUR BLOOD CONGEAL WITH HORROR LIKE THAT WHICH EVEN NOW CURDLESMINE SOMETIMES SEIZED WITH SUDDEN AGONY HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HISTALE AT OTHERS HIS VOICE BROKEN YET PIERCING UTTERED WITHDIFFICULTY THE WORDS SO REPLETE WITH ANGUISH. HIS FINE AND LOVELY EYESWERE NOW LIGHTED UP WITH INDIGNATION NOW SUBDUED TO DOWNCAST SORROWAND QUENCHED IN INFINITE WRETCHEDNESS. SOMETIMES HE COMMANDED HISCOUNTENANCE AND TONES AND RELATED THE MOST HORRIBLE INCIDENTS WITH ATRANQUIL VOICE SUPPRESSING EVERY MARK OF AGITATION THEN LIKE AVOLCANO BURSTING FORTH HIS FACE WOULD SUDDENLY CHANGE TO AN EXPRESSIONOF THE WILDEST RAGE AS HE SHRIEKED OUT IMPRECATIONS ON HIS PERSECUTOR.HIS TALE IS CONNECTED AND TOLD WITH AN APPEARANCE OF THE SIMPLEST TRUTHYET I OWN TO YOU THAT THE LETTERS OF FELIX AND SAFIE WHICH HE SHOWED MEAND THE APPARITION OF THE MONSTER SEEN FROM OUR SHIP BROUGHT TO ME AGREATER CONVICTION OF THE TRUTH OF HIS NARRATIVE THAN HIS ASSEVERATIONSHOWEVER EARNEST AND CONNECTED. SUCH A MONSTER HAS THEN REALLY EXISTENCEI CANNOT DOUBT IT YET I AM LOST IN SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION. SOMETIMES IENDEAVOURED TO GAIN FROM FRANKENSTEIN THE PARTICULARS OF HISCREATURES FORMATION BUT ON THIS POINT HE WAS IMPENETRABLE.ARE YOU MAD MY FRIEND SAID HE. OR WHITHER DOES YOURSENSELESS CURIOSITY LEAD YOU WOULD YOU ALSO CREATE FOR YOURSELF AND THEWORLD A DEMONIACAL ENEMY PEACE PEACE LEARN MY MISERIES AND DO NOT SEEKTO INCREASE YOUR OWN.FRANKENSTEIN DISCOVERED THAT I MADE NOTES CONCERNING HIS HISTORY HE ASKEDTO SEE THEM AND THEN HIMSELF CORRECTED AND AUGMENTED THEM IN MANY PLACESBUT PRINCIPALLY IN GIVING THE LIFE AND SPIRIT TO THE CONVERSATIONS HE HELDWITH HIS ENEMY. SINCE YOU HAVE PRESERVED MY NARRATION SAIDHE I WOULD NOT THAT A MUTILATED ONE SHOULD GO DOWN TOPOSTERITY.THUS HAS A WEEK PASSED AWAY WHILE I HAVE LISTENED TO THE STRANGESTTALE THAT EVER IMAGINATION FORMED. MY THOUGHTS AND EVERY FEELING OF MYSOUL HAVE BEEN DRUNK UP BY THE INTEREST FOR MY GUEST WHICH THIS TALEAND HIS OWN ELEVATED AND GENTLE MANNERS HAVE CREATED. I WISH TO SOOTHEHIM YET CAN I COUNSEL ONE SO INFINITELY MISERABLE SO DESTITUTE OFEVERY HOPE OF CONSOLATION TO LIVE OH NO THE ONLY JOY THAT HE CANNOW KNOW WILL BE WHEN HE COMPOSES HIS SHATTERED SPIRIT TO PEACE ANDDEATH. YET HE ENJOYS ONE COMFORT THE OFFSPRING OF SOLITUDE ANDDELIRIUM HE BELIEVES THAT WHEN IN DREAMS HE HOLDS CONVERSE WITH HISFRIENDS AND DERIVES FROM THAT COMMUNION CONSOLATION FOR HIS MISERIES OREXCITEMENTS TO HIS VENGEANCE THAT THEY ARE NOT THE CREATIONS OF HISFANCY BUT THE BEINGS THEMSELVES WHO VISIT HIM FROM THE REGIONS OF AREMOTE WORLD. THIS FAITH GIVES A SOLEMNITY TO HIS REVERIES THAT RENDERTHEM TO ME ALMOST AS IMPOSING AND INTERESTING AS TRUTH.OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS CONFINED TO HIS OWN HISTORY ANDMISFORTUNES. ON EVERY POINT OF GENERAL LITERATURE HE DISPLAYSUNBOUNDED KNOWLEDGE AND A QUICK AND PIERCING APPREHENSION. HISELOQUENCE IS FORCIBLE AND TOUCHING NOR CAN I HEAR HIM WHEN HE RELATESA PATHETIC INCIDENT OR ENDEAVOURS TO MOVE THE PASSIONS OF PITY OR LOVEWITHOUT TEARS. WHAT A GLORIOUS CREATURE MUST HE HAVE BEEN IN THE DAYSOF HIS PROSPERITY WHEN HE IS THUS NOBLE AND GODLIKE IN RUIN HE SEEMSTO FEEL HIS OWN WORTH AND THE GREATNESS OF HIS FALL.WHEN YOUNGER SAID HE I BELIEVED MYSELF DESTINED FORSOME GREAT ENTERPRISE. MY FEELINGS ARE PROFOUND BUT I POSSESSED A COOLNESSOF JUDGMENT THAT FITTED ME FOR ILLUSTRIOUS ACHIEVEMENTS. THIS SENTIMENT OFTHE WORTH OF MY NATURE SUPPORTED ME WHEN OTHERS WOULD HAVE BEEN OPPRESSEDFOR I DEEMED IT CRIMINAL TO THROW AWAY IN USELESS GRIEF THOSE TALENTS THATMIGHT BE USEFUL TO MY FELLOW CREATURES. WHEN I REFLECTED ON THE WORK I HADCOMPLETED NO LESS A ONE THAN THE CREATION OF A SENSITIVE AND RATIONALANIMAL I COULD NOT RANK MYSELF WITH THE HERD OF COMMON PROJECTORS. BUTTHIS THOUGHT WHICH SUPPORTED ME IN THE COMMENCEMENT OF MY CAREER NOWSERVES ONLY TO PLUNGE ME LOWER IN THE DUST. ALL MY SPECULATIONS AND HOPESARE AS NOTHING AND LIKE THE ARCHANGEL WHO ASPIRED TO OMNIPOTENCE I AMCHAINED IN AN ETERNAL HELL. MY IMAGINATION WAS VIVID YET MY POWERS OFANALYSIS AND APPLICATION WERE INTENSE BY THE UNION OF THESE QUALITIES ICONCEIVED THE IDEA AND EXECUTED THE CREATION OF A MAN. EVEN NOW I CANNOTRECOLLECT WITHOUT PASSION MY REVERIES WHILE THE WORK WAS INCOMPLETE. I TRODHEAVEN IN MY THOUGHTS NOW EXULTING IN MY POWERS NOW BURNING WITH THE IDEAOF THEIR EFFECTS. FROM MY INFANCY I WAS IMBUED WITH HIGH HOPES AND A LOFTYAMBITION BUT HOW AM I SUNK OH MY FRIEND IF YOU HAD KNOWN ME AS I ONCEWAS YOU WOULD NOT RECOGNISE ME IN THIS STATE OF DEGRADATION. DESPONDENCYRARELY VISITED MY HEART A HIGH DESTINY SEEMED TO BEAR ME ON UNTIL I FELLNEVER NEVER AGAIN TO RISE.MUST I THEN LOSE THIS ADMIRABLE BEING I HAVE LONGED FOR A FRIEND I HAVESOUGHT ONE WHO WOULD SYMPATHISE WITH AND LOVE ME. BEHOLD ON THESE DESERTSEAS I HAVE FOUND SUCH A ONE BUT I FEAR I HAVE GAINED HIM ONLY TO KNOW HISVALUE AND LOSE HIM. I WOULD RECONCILE HIM TO LIFE BUT HE REPULSES THE IDEA.I THANK YOU WALTON HE SAID FOR YOUR KIND INTENTIONS TOWARDS SOMISERABLE A WRETCH BUT WHEN YOU SPEAK OF NEW TIES AND FRESHAFFECTIONS THINK YOU THAT ANY CAN REPLACE THOSE WHO ARE GONE CAN ANYMAN BE TO ME AS CLERVAL WAS OR ANY WOMAN ANOTHER ELIZABETH EVENWHERE THE AFFECTIONS ARE NOT STRONGLY MOVED BY ANY SUPERIOR EXCELLENCETHE COMPANIONS OF OUR CHILDHOOD ALWAYS POSSESS A CERTAIN POWER OVER OURMINDS WHICH HARDLY ANY LATER FRIEND CAN OBTAIN. THEY KNOW OURINFANTINE DISPOSITIONS WHICH HOWEVER THEY MAY BE AFTERWARDS MODIFIEDARE NEVER ERADICATED AND THEY CAN JUDGE OF OUR ACTIONS WITH MORECERTAIN CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE INTEGRITY OF OUR MOTIVES. A SISTER OR ABROTHER CAN NEVER UNLESS INDEED SUCH SYMPTOMS HAVE BEEN SHOWN EARLYSUSPECT THE OTHER OF FRAUD OR FALSE DEALING WHEN ANOTHER FRIENDHOWEVER STRONGLY HE MAY BE ATTACHED MAY IN SPITE OF HIMSELF BECONTEMPLATED WITH SUSPICION. BUT I ENJOYED FRIENDS DEAR NOT ONLYTHROUGH HABIT AND ASSOCIATION BUT FROM THEIR OWN MERITS AND WHEREVERI AM THE SOOTHING VOICE OF MY ELIZABETH AND THE CONVERSATION OFCLERVAL WILL BE EVER WHISPERED IN MY EAR. THEY ARE DEAD AND BUT ONEFEELING IN SUCH A SOLITUDE CAN PERSUADE ME TO PRESERVE MY LIFE. IF IWERE ENGAGED IN ANY HIGH UNDERTAKING OR DESIGN FRAUGHT WITH EXTENSIVEUTILITY TO MY FELLOW CREATURES THEN COULD I LIVE TO FULFIL IT. BUTSUCH IS NOT MY DESTINY I MUST PURSUE AND DESTROY THE BEING TO WHOM IGAVE EXISTENCE THEN MY LOT ON EARTH WILL BE FULFILLED AND I MAY DIE.MY BELOVED SISTERSEPTEMBER D.I WRITE TO YOU ENCOMPASSED BY PERIL AND IGNORANT WHETHER I AM EVERDOOMED TO SEE AGAIN DEAR ENGLAND AND THE DEARER FRIENDS THAT INHABITIT. I AM SURROUNDED BY MOUNTAINS OF ICE WHICH ADMIT OF NO ESCAPE ANDTHREATEN EVERY MOMENT TO CRUSH MY VESSEL. THE BRAVE FELLOWS WHOM IHAVE PERSUADED TO BE MY COMPANIONS LOOK TOWARDS ME FOR AID BUT I HAVENONE TO BESTOW. THERE IS SOMETHING TERRIBLY APPALLING IN OURSITUATION YET MY COURAGE AND HOPES DO NOT DESERT ME. YET IT ISTERRIBLE TO REFLECT THAT THE LIVES OF ALL THESE MEN ARE ENDANGEREDTHROUGH ME. IF WE ARE LOST MY MAD SCHEMES ARE THE CAUSE.AND WHAT MARGARET WILL BE THE STATE OF YOUR MIND YOU WILL NOT HEAR OF MYDESTRUCTION AND YOU WILL ANXIOUSLY AWAIT MY RETURN. YEARS WILL PASS ANDYOU WILL HAVE VISITINGS OF DESPAIR AND YET BE TORTURED BY HOPE. OH MYBELOVED SISTER THE SICKENING FAILING OF YOUR HEARTFELT EXPECTATIONS ISIN PROSPECT MORE TERRIBLE TO ME THAN MY OWN DEATH. BUT YOU HAVE A HUSBANDAND LOVELY CHILDREN YOU MAY BE HAPPY. HEAVEN BLESS YOU AND MAKE YOU SOMY UNFORTUNATE GUEST REGARDS ME WITH THE TENDEREST COMPASSION. HEENDEAVOURS TO FILL ME WITH HOPE AND TALKS AS IF LIFE WERE A POSSESSIONWHICH HE VALUED. HE REMINDS ME HOW OFTEN THE SAME ACCIDENTS HAVEHAPPENED TO OTHER NAVIGATORS WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED THIS SEA AND IN SPITEOF MYSELF HE FILLS ME WITH CHEERFUL AUGURIES. EVEN THE SAILORS FEELTHE POWER OF HIS ELOQUENCE WHEN HE SPEAKS THEY NO LONGER DESPAIR HEROUSES THEIR ENERGIES AND WHILE THEY HEAR HIS VOICE THEY BELIEVE THESEVAST MOUNTAINS OF ICE ARE MOLEHILLS WHICH WILL VANISH BEFORE THERESOLUTIONS OF MAN. THESE FEELINGS ARE TRANSITORY EACH DAY OFEXPECTATION DELAYED FILLS THEM WITH FEAR AND I ALMOST DREAD A MUTINYCAUSED BY THIS DESPAIR.SEPTEMBER TH.A SCENE HAS JUST PASSED OF SUCH UNCOMMON INTEREST THAT ALTHOUGH IT ISHIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THESE PAPERS MAY NEVER REACH YOU YET I CANNOTFORBEAR RECORDING IT.WE ARE STILL SURROUNDED BY MOUNTAINS OF ICE STILL IN IMMINENT DANGEROF BEING CRUSHED IN THEIR CONFLICT. THE COLD IS EXCESSIVE AND MANY OFMY UNFORTUNATE COMRADES HAVE ALREADY FOUND A GRAVE AMIDST THIS SCENE OFDESOLATION. FRANKENSTEIN HAS DAILY DECLINED IN HEALTH A FEVERISH FIRESTILL GLIMMERS IN HIS EYES BUT HE IS EXHAUSTED AND WHEN SUDDENLYROUSED TO ANY EXERTION HE SPEEDILY SINKS AGAIN INTO APPARENTLIFELESSNESS.I MENTIONED IN MY LAST LETTER THE FEARS I ENTERTAINED OF A MUTINY.THIS MORNING AS I SAT WATCHING THE WAN COUNTENANCE OF MY FRIENDHISEYES HALF CLOSED AND HIS LIMBS HANGING LISTLESSLYI WAS ROUSED BY HALFA DOZEN OF THE SAILORS WHO DEMANDED ADMISSION INTO THE CABIN. THEYENTERED AND THEIR LEADER ADDRESSED ME. HE TOLD ME THAT HE AND HISCOMPANIONS HAD BEEN CHOSEN BY THE OTHER SAILORS TO COME IN DEPUTATIONTO ME TO MAKE ME A REQUISITION WHICH IN JUSTICE I COULD NOT REFUSE.WE WERE IMMURED IN ICE AND SHOULD PROBABLY NEVER ESCAPE BUT THEYFEARED THAT IF AS WAS POSSIBLE THE ICE SHOULD DISSIPATE AND A FREEPASSAGE BE OPENED I SHOULD BE RASH ENOUGH TO CONTINUE MY VOYAGE ANDLEAD THEM INTO FRESH DANGERS AFTER THEY MIGHT HAPPILY HAVE SURMOUNTEDTHIS. THEY INSISTED THEREFORE THAT I SHOULD ENGAGE WITH A SOLEMNPROMISE THAT IF THE VESSEL SHOULD BE FREED I WOULD INSTANTLY DIRECT MYCOURSE SOUTHWARDS.THIS SPEECH TROUBLED ME. I HAD NOT DESPAIRED NOR HAD I YET CONCEIVEDTHE IDEA OF RETURNING IF SET FREE. YET COULD I IN JUSTICE OR EVEN INPOSSIBILITY REFUSE THIS DEMAND I HESITATED BEFORE I ANSWERED WHENFRANKENSTEIN WHO HAD AT FIRST BEEN SILENT AND INDEED APPEARED HARDLYTO HAVE FORCE ENOUGH TO ATTEND NOW ROUSED HIMSELF HIS EYES SPARKLEDAND HIS CHEEKS FLUSHED WITH MOMENTARY VIGOUR. TURNING TOWARDS THE MENHE SAIDWHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT DO YOU DEMAND OF YOUR CAPTAIN ARE YOU THENSO EASILY TURNED FROM YOUR DESIGN DID YOU NOT CALL THIS A GLORIOUSEXPEDITION AND WHEREFORE WAS IT GLORIOUS NOT BECAUSE THE WAY WASSMOOTH AND PLACID AS A SOUTHERN SEA BUT BECAUSE IT WAS FULL OF DANGERS ANDTERROR BECAUSE AT EVERY NEW INCIDENT YOUR FORTITUDE WAS TO BE CALLED FORTHAND YOUR COURAGE EXHIBITED BECAUSE DANGER AND DEATH SURROUNDED IT ANDTHESE YOU WERE TO BRAVE AND OVERCOME. FOR THIS WAS IT A GLORIOUS FOR THISWAS IT AN HONOURABLE UNDERTAKING. YOU WERE HEREAFTER TO BE HAILED AS THEBENEFACTORS OF YOUR SPECIES YOUR NAMES ADORED AS BELONGING TO BRAVE MENWHO ENCOUNTERED DEATH FOR HONOUR AND THE BENEFIT OF MANKIND. AND NOWBEHOLD WITH THE FIRST IMAGINATION OF DANGER OR IF YOU WILL THE FIRSTMIGHTY AND TERRIFIC TRIAL OF YOUR COURAGE YOU SHRINK AWAY AND ARE CONTENTTO BE HANDED DOWN AS MEN WHO HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO ENDURE COLD ANDPERIL AND SO POOR SOULS THEY WERE CHILLY AND RETURNED TO THEIR WARMFIRESIDES. WHY THAT REQUIRES NOT THIS PREPARATION YE NEED NOT HAVE COMETHUS FAR AND DRAGGED YOUR CAPTAIN TO THE SHAME OF A DEFEAT MERELY TO PROVEYOURSELVES COWARDS. OH BE MEN OR BE MORE THAN MEN. BE STEADY TO YOURPURPOSES AND FIRM AS A ROCK. THIS ICE IS NOT MADE OF SUCH STUFF AS YOURHEARTS MAY BE IT IS MUTABLE AND CANNOT WITHSTAND YOU IF YOU SAY THAT ITSHALL NOT. DO NOT RETURN TO YOUR FAMILIES WITH THE STIGMA OF DISGRACEMARKED ON YOUR BROWS. RETURN AS HEROES WHO HAVE FOUGHT AND CONQUERED ANDWHO KNOW NOT WHAT IT IS TO TURN THEIR BACKS ON THE FOE.HE SPOKE THIS WITH A VOICE SO MODULATED TO THE DIFFERENT FEELINGS EXPRESSEDIN HIS SPEECH WITH AN EYE SO FULL OF LOFTY DESIGN AND HEROISM THAT CANYOU WONDER THAT THESE MEN WERE MOVED THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND WEREUNABLE TO REPLY. I SPOKE I TOLD THEM TO RETIRE AND CONSIDER OF WHAT HADBEEN SAID THAT I WOULD NOT LEAD THEM FARTHER NORTH IF THEY STRENUOUSLYDESIRED THE CONTRARY BUT THAT I HOPED THAT WITH REFLECTION THEIR COURAGEWOULD RETURN.THEY RETIRED AND I TURNED TOWARDS MY FRIEND BUT HE WAS SUNK IN LANGUOR ANDALMOST DEPRIVED OF LIFE.HOW ALL THIS WILL TERMINATE I KNOW NOT BUT I HAD RATHER DIE THANRETURN SHAMEFULLY MY PURPOSE UNFULFILLED. YET I FEAR SUCH WILL BE MYFATE THE MEN UNSUPPORTED BY IDEAS OF GLORY AND HONOUR CAN NEVERWILLINGLY CONTINUE TO ENDURE THEIR PRESENT HARDSHIPS.SEPTEMBER TH.THE DIE IS CAST I HAVE CONSENTED TO RETURN IF WE ARE NOT DESTROYED.THUS ARE MY HOPES BLASTED BY COWARDICE AND INDECISION I COME BACKIGNORANT AND DISAPPOINTED. IT REQUIRES MORE PHILOSOPHY THAN I POSSESSTO BEAR THIS INJUSTICE WITH PATIENCE.SEPTEMBER TH.IT IS PAST I AM RETURNING TO ENGLAND. I HAVE LOST MY HOPES OF UTILITYAND GLORY I HAVE LOST MY FRIEND. BUT I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO DETAIL THESEBITTER CIRCUMSTANCES TO YOU MY DEAR SISTER AND WHILE I AM WAFTEDTOWARDS ENGLAND AND TOWARDS YOU I WILL NOT DESPOND.SEPTEMBER TH THE ICE BEGAN TO MOVE AND ROARINGS LIKE THUNDER WERE HEARDAT A DISTANCE AS THE ISLANDS SPLIT AND CRACKED IN EVERY DIRECTION. WE WEREIN THE MOST IMMINENT PERIL BUT AS WE COULD ONLY REMAIN PASSIVE MY CHIEFATTENTION WAS OCCUPIED BY MY UNFORTUNATE GUEST WHOSE ILLNESS INCREASED INSUCH A DEGREE THAT HE WAS ENTIRELY CONFINED TO HIS BED. THE ICE CRACKEDBEHIND US AND WAS DRIVEN WITH FORCE TOWARDS THE NORTH A BREEZE SPRANG FROMTHE WEST AND ON THE TH THE PASSAGE TOWARDS THE SOUTH BECAME PERFECTLYFREE. WHEN THE SAILORS SAW THIS AND THAT THEIR RETURN TO THEIR NATIVECOUNTRY WAS APPARENTLY ASSURED A SHOUT OF TUMULTUOUS JOY BROKE FROM THEMLOUD AND LONGCONTINUED. FRANKENSTEIN WHO WAS DOZING AWOKE AND ASKED THECAUSE OF THE TUMULT. THEY SHOUT I SAID BECAUSE THEYWILL SOON RETURN TO ENGLAND.DO YOU THEN REALLY RETURNALAS YES I CANNOT WITHSTAND THEIR DEMANDS. I CANNOT LEAD THEMUNWILLINGLY TO DANGER AND I MUST RETURN.DO SO IF YOU WILL BUT I WILL NOT. YOU MAY GIVE UP YOUR PURPOSE BUTMINE IS ASSIGNED TO ME BY HEAVEN AND I DARE NOT. I AM WEAK BUTSURELY THE SPIRITS WHO ASSIST MY VENGEANCE WILL ENDOW ME WITHSUFFICIENT STRENGTH. SAYING THIS HE ENDEAVOURED TO SPRING FROM THEBED BUT THE EXERTION WAS TOO GREAT FOR HIM HE FELL BACK AND FAINTED.IT WAS LONG BEFORE HE WAS RESTORED AND I OFTEN THOUGHT THAT LIFE WASENTIRELY EXTINCT. AT LENGTH HE OPENED HIS EYES HE BREATHED WITHDIFFICULTY AND WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK. THE SURGEON GAVE HIM A COMPOSINGDRAUGHT AND ORDERED US TO LEAVE HIM UNDISTURBED. IN THE MEANTIME HETOLD ME THAT MY FRIEND HAD CERTAINLY NOT MANY HOURS TO LIVE.HIS SENTENCE WAS PRONOUNCED AND I COULD ONLY GRIEVE AND BE PATIENT. I SATBY HIS BED WATCHING HIM HIS EYES WERE CLOSED AND I THOUGHT HE SLEPT BUTPRESENTLY HE CALLED TO ME IN A FEEBLE VOICE AND BIDDING ME COME NEARSAID ALAS THE STRENGTH I RELIED ON IS GONE I FEEL THAT I SHALLSOON DIE AND HE MY ENEMY AND PERSECUTOR MAY STILL BE IN BEING. THINKNOT WALTON THAT IN THE LAST MOMENTS OF MY EXISTENCE I FEEL THAT BURNINGHATRED AND ARDENT DESIRE OF REVENGE I ONCE EXPRESSED BUT I FEEL MYSELFJUSTIFIED IN DESIRING THE DEATH OF MY ADVERSARY. DURING THESE LAST DAYS IHAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN EXAMINING MY PAST CONDUCT NOR DO I FIND IT BLAMABLE.IN A FIT OF ENTHUSIASTIC MADNESS I CREATED A RATIONAL CREATURE AND WASBOUND TOWARDS HIM TO ASSURE AS FAR AS WAS IN MY POWER HIS HAPPINESS ANDWELLBEING. THIS WAS MY DUTY BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER STILL PARAMOUNT TOTHAT. MY DUTIES TOWARDS THE BEINGS OF MY OWN SPECIES HAD GREATER CLAIMS TOMY ATTENTION BECAUSE THEY INCLUDED A GREATER PROPORTION OF HAPPINESS ORMISERY. URGED BY THIS VIEW I REFUSED AND I DID RIGHT IN REFUSING TOCREATE A COMPANION FOR THE FIRST CREATURE. HE SHOWED UNPARALLELED MALIGNITYAND SELFISHNESS IN EVIL HE DESTROYED MY FRIENDS HE DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTIONBEINGS WHO POSSESSED EXQUISITE SENSATIONS HAPPINESS AND WISDOM NOR DO IKNOW WHERE THIS THIRST FOR VENGEANCE MAY END. MISERABLE HIMSELF THAT HE MAYRENDER NO OTHER WRETCHED HE OUGHT TO DIE. THE TASK OF HIS DESTRUCTION WASMINE BUT I HAVE FAILED. WHEN ACTUATED BY SELFISH AND VICIOUS MOTIVES IASKED YOU TO UNDERTAKE MY UNFINISHED WORK AND I RENEW THIS REQUEST NOWWHEN I AM ONLY INDUCED BY REASON AND VIRTUE.YET I CANNOT ASK YOU TO RENOUNCE YOUR COUNTRY AND FRIENDS TO FULFILTHIS TASK AND NOW THAT YOU ARE RETURNING TO ENGLAND YOU WILL HAVELITTLE CHANCE OF MEETING WITH HIM. BUT THE CONSIDERATION OF THESEPOINTS AND THE WELL BALANCING OF WHAT YOU MAY ESTEEM YOUR DUTIES ILEAVE TO YOU MY JUDGMENT AND IDEAS ARE ALREADY DISTURBED BY THE NEARAPPROACH OF DEATH. I DARE NOT ASK YOU TO DO WHAT I THINK RIGHT FOR IMAY STILL BE MISLED BY PASSION.THAT HE SHOULD LIVE TO BE AN INSTRUMENT OF MISCHIEF DISTURBS ME INOTHER RESPECTS THIS HOUR WHEN I MOMENTARILY EXPECT MY RELEASE IS THEONLY HAPPY ONE WHICH I HAVE ENJOYED FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THE FORMS OFTHE BELOVED DEAD FLIT BEFORE ME AND I HASTEN TO THEIR ARMS. FAREWELLWALTON SEEK HAPPINESS IN TRANQUILLITY AND AVOID AMBITION EVEN IF ITBE ONLY THE APPARENTLY INNOCENT ONE OF DISTINGUISHING YOURSELF INSCIENCE AND DISCOVERIES. YET WHY DO I SAY THIS I HAVE MYSELF BEENBLASTED IN THESE HOPES YET ANOTHER MAY SUCCEED.HIS VOICE BECAME FAINTER AS HE SPOKE AND AT LENGTH EXHAUSTED BY HISEFFORT HE SANK INTO SILENCE. ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HEATTEMPTED AGAIN TO SPEAK BUT WAS UNABLE HE PRESSED MY HAND FEEBLY ANDHIS EYES CLOSED FOR EVER WHILE THE IRRADIATION OF A GENTLE SMILE PASSEDAWAY FROM HIS LIPS.MARGARET WHAT COMMENT CAN I MAKE ON THE UNTIMELY EXTINCTION OF THISGLORIOUS SPIRIT WHAT CAN I SAY THAT WILL ENABLE YOU TO UNDERSTAND THEDEPTH OF MY SORROW ALL THAT I SHOULD EXPRESS WOULD BE INADEQUATE ANDFEEBLE. MY TEARS FLOW MY MIND IS OVERSHADOWED BY A CLOUD OFDISAPPOINTMENT. BUT I JOURNEY TOWARDS ENGLAND AND I MAY THERE FINDCONSOLATION.I AM INTERRUPTED. WHAT DO THESE SOUNDS PORTEND IT IS MIDNIGHT THEBREEZE BLOWS FAIRLY AND THE WATCH ON DECK SCARCELY STIR. AGAIN THEREIS A SOUND AS OF A HUMAN VOICE BUT HOARSER IT COMES FROM THE CABINWHERE THE REMAINS OF FRANKENSTEIN STILL LIE. I MUST ARISE AND EXAMINE.GOOD NIGHT MY SISTER.GREAT GOD WHAT A SCENE HAS JUST TAKEN PLACE I AM YET DIZZY WITH THEREMEMBRANCE OF IT. I HARDLY KNOW WHETHER I SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO DETAILIT YET THE TALE WHICH I HAVE RECORDED WOULD BE INCOMPLETE WITHOUT THISFINAL AND WONDERFUL CATASTROPHE.I ENTERED THE CABIN WHERE LAY THE REMAINS OF MY ILLFATED AND ADMIRABLEFRIEND. OVER HIM HUNG A FORM WHICH I CANNOT FIND WORDS TODESCRIBEGIGANTIC IN STATURE YET UNCOUTH AND DISTORTED IN ITSPROPORTIONS. AS HE HUNG OVER THE COFFIN HIS FACE WAS CONCEALED BY LONGLOCKS OF RAGGED HAIR BUT ONE VAST HAND WAS EXTENDED IN COLOUR ANDAPPARENT TEXTURE LIKE THAT OF A MUMMY. WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF MYAPPROACH HE CEASED TO UTTER EXCLAMATIONS OF GRIEF AND HORROR AND SPRUNGTOWARDS THE WINDOW. NEVER DID I BEHOLD A VISION SO HORRIBLE AS HIS FACE OFSUCH LOATHSOME YET APPALLING HIDEOUSNESS. I SHUT MY EYES INVOLUNTARILY ANDENDEAVOURED TO RECOLLECT WHAT WERE MY DUTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS DESTROYER.I CALLED ON HIM TO STAY.HE PAUSED LOOKING ON ME WITH WONDER AND AGAIN TURNING TOWARDS THELIFELESS FORM OF HIS CREATOR HE SEEMED TO FORGET MY PRESENCE ANDEVERY FEATURE AND GESTURE SEEMED INSTIGATED BY THE WILDEST RAGE OF SOMEUNCONTROLLABLE PASSION.THAT IS ALSO MY VICTIM HE EXCLAIMED. IN HIS MURDER MYCRIMES ARE CONSUMMATED THE MISERABLE SERIES OF MY BEING IS WOUND TO ITSCLOSE OH FRANKENSTEIN GENEROUS AND SELFDEVOTED BEING WHAT DOES ITAVAIL THAT I NOW ASK THEE TO PARDON ME I WHO IRRETRIEVABLY DESTROYED THEEBY DESTROYING ALL THOU LOVEDST. ALAS HE IS COLD HE CANNOT ANSWERME.HIS VOICE SEEMED SUFFOCATED AND MY FIRST IMPULSES WHICH HAD SUGGESTED TOME THE DUTY OF OBEYING THE DYING REQUEST OF MY FRIEND IN DESTROYING HISENEMY WERE NOW SUSPENDED BY A MIXTURE OF CURIOSITY AND COMPASSION. IAPPROACHED THIS TREMENDOUS BEING I DARED NOT AGAIN RAISE MY EYES TO HISFACE THERE WAS SOMETHING SO SCARING AND UNEARTHLY IN HIS UGLINESS. IATTEMPTED TO SPEAK BUT THE WORDS DIED AWAY ON MY LIPS. THE MONSTERCONTINUED TO UTTER WILD AND INCOHERENT SELFREPROACHES. AT LENGTH IGATHERED RESOLUTION TO ADDRESS HIM IN A PAUSE OF THE TEMPEST OF HIS PASSION.YOUR REPENTANCE I SAID IS NOW SUPERFLUOUS. IF YOUHAD LISTENED TO THE VOICE OF CONSCIENCE AND HEEDED THE STINGS OF REMORSEBEFORE YOU HAD URGED YOUR DIABOLICAL VENGEANCE TO THIS EXTREMITYFRANKENSTEIN WOULD YET HAVE LIVED.AND DO YOU DREAM SAID THE DMON. DO YOU THINK THAT I WAS THENDEAD TO AGONY AND REMORSE HE HE CONTINUED POINTING TO THE CORPSEHE SUFFERED NOT IN THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DEED. OH NOT THETENTHOUSANDTH PORTION OF THE ANGUISH THAT WAS MINE DURING THELINGERING DETAIL OF ITS EXECUTION. A FRIGHTFUL SELFISHNESS HURRIED MEON WHILE MY HEART WAS POISONED WITH REMORSE. THINK YOU THAT THEGROANS OF CLERVAL WERE MUSIC TO MY EARS MY HEART WAS FASHIONED TO BESUSCEPTIBLE OF LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND WHEN WRENCHED BY MISERY TO VICEAND HATRED IT DID NOT ENDURE THE VIOLENCE OF THE CHANGE WITHOUTTORTURE SUCH AS YOU CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE.AFTER THE MURDER OF CLERVAL I RETURNED TO SWITZERLAND HEARTBROKENAND OVERCOME. I PITIED FRANKENSTEIN MY PITY AMOUNTED TO HORROR IABHORRED MYSELF. BUT WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT HE THE AUTHOR AT ONCE OFMY EXISTENCE AND OF ITS UNSPEAKABLE TORMENTS DARED TO HOPE FORHAPPINESS THAT WHILE HE ACCUMULATED WRETCHEDNESS AND DESPAIR UPON MEHE SOUGHT HIS OWN ENJOYMENT IN FEELINGS AND PASSIONS FROM THEINDULGENCE OF WHICH I WAS FOR EVER BARRED THEN IMPOTENT ENVY AND BITTERINDIGNATION FILLED ME WITH AN INSATIABLE THIRST FOR VENGEANCE. IRECOLLECTED MY THREAT AND RESOLVED THAT IT SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED. IKNEW THAT I WAS PREPARING FOR MYSELF A DEADLY TORTURE BUT I WAS THESLAVE NOT THE MASTER OF AN IMPULSE WHICH I DETESTED YET COULD NOTDISOBEY. YET WHEN SHE DIED NAY THEN I WAS NOT MISERABLE. I HADCAST OFF ALL FEELING SUBDUED ALL ANGUISH TO RIOT IN THE EXCESS OF MYDESPAIR. EVIL THENCEFORTH BECAME MY GOOD. URGED THUS FAR I HAD NOCHOICE BUT TO ADAPT MY NATURE TO AN ELEMENT WHICH I HAD WILLINGLYCHOSEN. THE COMPLETION OF MY DEMONIACAL DESIGN BECAME AN INSATIABLEPASSION. AND NOW IT IS ENDED THERE IS MY LAST VICTIMI WAS AT FIRST TOUCHED BY THE EXPRESSIONS OF HIS MISERY YET WHEN I CALLEDTO MIND WHAT FRANKENSTEIN HAD SAID OF HIS POWERS OF ELOQUENCE ANDPERSUASION AND WHEN I AGAIN CAST MY EYES ON THE LIFELESS FORM OF MYFRIEND INDIGNATION WAS REKINDLED WITHIN ME. WRETCH I SAID.IT IS WELL THAT YOU COME HERE TO WHINE OVER THE DESOLATION THAT YOUHAVE MADE. YOU THROW A TORCH INTO A PILE OF BUILDINGS AND WHEN THEY ARECONSUMED YOU SIT AMONG THE RUINS AND LAMENT THE FALL. HYPOCRITICAL FIENDIF HE WHOM YOU MOURN STILL LIVED STILL WOULD HE BE THE OBJECT AGAIN WOULDHE BECOME THE PREY OF YOUR ACCURSED VENGEANCE. IT IS NOT PITY THAT YOUFEEL YOU LAMENT ONLY BECAUSE THE VICTIM OF YOUR MALIGNITY IS WITHDRAWNFROM YOUR POWER.OH IT IS NOT THUSNOT THUS INTERRUPTED THE BEING.YET SUCH MUST BE THE IMPRESSION CONVEYED TO YOU BY WHAT APPEARS TOBE THE PURPORT OF MY ACTIONS. YET I SEEK NOT A FELLOW FEELING IN MY MISERY.NO SYMPATHY MAY I EVER FIND. WHEN I FIRST SOUGHT IT IT WAS THE LOVE OFVIRTUE THE FEELINGS OF HAPPINESS AND AFFECTION WITH WHICH MY WHOLE BEINGOVERFLOWED THAT I WISHED TO BE PARTICIPATED. BUT NOW THAT VIRTUE HASBECOME TO ME A SHADOW AND THAT HAPPINESS AND AFFECTION ARE TURNED INTOBITTER AND LOATHING DESPAIR IN WHAT SHOULD I SEEK FOR SYMPATHY I AMCONTENT TO SUFFER ALONE WHILE MY SUFFERINGS SHALL ENDURE WHEN I DIE I AMWELL SATISFIED THAT ABHORRENCE AND OPPROBRIUM SHOULD LOAD MY MEMORY. ONCEMY FANCY WAS SOOTHED WITH DREAMS OF VIRTUE OF FAME AND OF ENJOYMENT. ONCEI FALSELY HOPED TO MEET WITH BEINGS WHO PARDONING MY OUTWARD FORM WOULDLOVE ME FOR THE EXCELLENT QUALITIES WHICH I WAS CAPABLE OF UNFOLDING. I WASNOURISHED WITH HIGH THOUGHTS OF HONOUR AND DEVOTION. BUT NOW CRIME HASDEGRADED ME BENEATH THE MEANEST ANIMAL. NO GUILT NO MISCHIEF NOMALIGNITY NO MISERY CAN BE FOUND COMPARABLE TO MINE. WHEN I RUN OVER THEFRIGHTFUL CATALOGUE OF MY SINS I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT I AM THE SAMECREATURE WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE ONCE FILLED WITH SUBLIME AND TRANSCENDENTVISIONS OF THE BEAUTY AND THE MAJESTY OF GOODNESS. BUT IT IS EVEN SO THEFALLEN ANGEL BECOMES A MALIGNANT DEVIL. YET EVEN THAT ENEMY OF GOD AND MANHAD FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES IN HIS DESOLATION I AM ALONE.YOU WHO CALL FRANKENSTEIN YOUR FRIEND SEEM TO HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF MYCRIMES AND HIS MISFORTUNES. BUT IN THE DETAIL WHICH HE GAVE YOU OF THEMHE COULD NOT SUM UP THE HOURS AND MONTHS OF MISERY WHICH I ENDUREDWASTING IN IMPOTENT PASSIONS. FOR WHILE I DESTROYED HIS HOPES I DIDNOT SATISFY MY OWN DESIRES. THEY WERE FOR EVER ARDENT AND CRAVING STILLI DESIRED LOVE AND FELLOWSHIP AND I WAS STILL SPURNED. WAS THERE NOINJUSTICE IN THIS AM I TO BE THOUGHT THE ONLY CRIMINAL WHEN ALLHUMANKIND SINNED AGAINST ME WHY DO YOU NOT HATE FELIX WHO DROVE HISFRIEND FROM HIS DOOR WITH CONTUMELY WHY DO YOU NOT EXECRATE THE RUSTICWHO SOUGHT TO DESTROY THE SAVIOUR OF HIS CHILD NAY THESE ARE VIRTUOUSAND IMMACULATE BEINGS I THE MISERABLE AND THE ABANDONED AM ANABORTION TO BE SPURNED AT AND KICKED AND TRAMPLED ON. EVEN NOW MYBLOOD BOILS AT THE RECOLLECTION OF THIS INJUSTICE.BUT IT IS TRUE THAT I AM A WRETCH. I HAVE MURDERED THE LOVELY ANDTHE HELPLESS I HAVE STRANGLED THE INNOCENT AS THEY SLEPT AND GRASPED TODEATH HIS THROAT WHO NEVER INJURED ME OR ANY OTHER LIVING THING. I HAVEDEVOTED MY CREATOR THE SELECT SPECIMEN OF ALL THAT IS WORTHY OF LOVE ANDADMIRATION AMONG MEN TO MISERY I HAVE PURSUED HIM EVEN TO THATIRREMEDIABLE RUIN. THERE HE LIES WHITE AND COLD IN DEATH. YOU HATE ME BUTYOUR ABHORRENCE CANNOT EQUAL THAT WITH WHICH I REGARD MYSELF. I LOOK ON THEHANDS WHICH EXECUTED THE DEED I THINK ON THE HEART IN WHICH THEIMAGINATION OF IT WAS CONCEIVED AND LONG FOR THE MOMENT WHEN THESE HANDSWILL MEET MY EYES WHEN THAT IMAGINATION WILL HAUNT MY THOUGHTS NO MORE.FEAR NOT THAT I SHALL BE THE INSTRUMENT OF FUTURE MISCHIEF. MY WORKIS NEARLY COMPLETE. NEITHER YOURS NOR ANY MANS DEATH IS NEEDED TOCONSUMMATE THE SERIES OF MY BEING AND ACCOMPLISH THAT WHICH MUST BE DONEBUT IT REQUIRES MY OWN. DO NOT THINK THAT I SHALL BE SLOW TO PERFORM THISSACRIFICE. I SHALL QUIT YOUR VESSEL ON THE ICE RAFT WHICH BROUGHT METHITHER AND SHALL SEEK THE MOST NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE GLOBE I SHALLCOLLECT MY FUNERAL PILE AND CONSUME TO ASHES THIS MISERABLE FRAME THAT ITSREMAINS MAY AFFORD NO LIGHT TO ANY CURIOUS AND UNHALLOWED WRETCH WHO WOULDCREATE SUCH ANOTHER AS I HAVE BEEN. I SHALL DIE. I SHALL NO LONGER FEEL THEAGONIES WHICH NOW CONSUME ME OR BE THE PREY OF FEELINGS UNSATISFIED YETUNQUENCHED. HE IS DEAD WHO CALLED ME INTO BEING AND WHEN I SHALL BE NOMORE THE VERY REMEMBRANCE OF US BOTH WILL SPEEDILY VANISH. I SHALL NOLONGER SEE THE SUN OR STARS OR FEEL THE WINDS PLAY ON MY CHEEKS. LIGHTFEELING AND SENSE WILL PASS AWAY AND IN THIS CONDITION MUST I FIND MYHAPPINESS. SOME YEARS AGO WHEN THE IMAGES WHICH THIS WORLD AFFORDS FIRSTOPENED UPON ME WHEN I FELT THE CHEERING WARMTH OF SUMMER AND HEARD THERUSTLING OF THE LEAVES AND THE WARBLING OF THE BIRDS AND THESE WERE ALL TOME I SHOULD HAVE WEPT TO DIE NOW IT IS MY ONLY CONSOLATION. POLLUTED BYCRIMES AND TORN BY THE BITTEREST REMORSE WHERE CAN I FIND REST BUT INDEATHFAREWELL I LEAVE YOU AND IN YOU THE LAST OF HUMANKIND WHOM THESEEYES WILL EVER BEHOLD. FAREWELL FRANKENSTEIN IF THOU WERT YET ALIVEAND YET CHERISHED A DESIRE OF REVENGE AGAINST ME IT WOULD BE BETTERSATIATED IN MY LIFE THAN IN MY DESTRUCTION. BUT IT WAS NOT SO THOUDIDST SEEK MY EXTINCTION THAT I MIGHT NOT CAUSE GREATER WRETCHEDNESSAND IF YET IN SOME MODE UNKNOWN TO ME THOU HADST NOT CEASED TO THINKAND FEEL THOU WOULDST NOT DESIRE AGAINST ME A VENGEANCE GREATER THANTHAT WHICH I FEEL. BLASTED AS THOU WERT MY AGONY WAS STILL SUPERIOR TOTHINE FOR THE BITTER STING OF REMORSE WILL NOT CEASE TO RANKLE IN MYWOUNDS UNTIL DEATH SHALL CLOSE THEM FOR EVER.BUT SOON HE CRIED WITH SAD AND SOLEMN ENTHUSIASM ISHALL DIE AND WHAT I NOW FEEL BE NO LONGER FELT. SOON THESE BURNINGMISERIES WILL BE EXTINCT. I SHALL ASCEND MY FUNERAL PILE TRIUMPHANTLY ANDEXULT IN THE AGONY OF THE TORTURING FLAMES. THE LIGHT OF THAT CONFLAGRATIONWILL FADE AWAY MY ASHES WILL BE SWEPT INTO THE SEA BY THE WINDS. MY SPIRITWILL SLEEP IN PEACE OR IF IT THINKS IT WILL NOT SURELY THINK THUS.FAREWELL.HE SPRANG FROM THE CABINWINDOW AS HE SAID THIS UPON THE ICE RAFTWHICH LAY CLOSE TO THE VESSEL. HE WAS SOON BORNE AWAY BY THE WAVES ANDLOST IN DARKNESS AND DISTANCE.\n",

THE HORROR IN CLAY.THE MOST MERCIFUL THING IN THE WORLD I THINK IS THE INABILITY OF THEHUMAN MIND TO CORRELATE ALL ITS CONTENTS. WE LIVE ON A PLACID ISLANDOF IGNORANCE IN THE MIDST OF BLACK SEAS OF INFINITY AND IT WAS NOTMEANT THAT WE SHOULD VOYAGE FAR. THE SCIENCES EACH STRAINING IN ITSOWN DIRECTION HAVE HITHERTO HARMED US LITTLE BUT SOME DAY THE PIECINGTOGETHER OF DISSOCIATED KNOWLEDGE WILL OPEN UP SUCH TERRIFYING VISTASOF REALITY AND OF OUR FRIGHTFUL POSITION THEREIN THAT WE SHALL EITHERGO MAD FROM THE REVELATION OR FLEE FROM THE DEADLY LIGHT INTO THE PEACEAND SAFETY OF A NEW DARK AGE.THEOSOPHISTS HAVE GUESSED AT THE AWESOME GRANDEUR OF THE COSMIC CYCLEWHEREIN OUR WORLD AND HUMAN RACE FORM TRANSIENT INCIDENTS. THEY HAVEHINTED AT STRANGE SURVIVALS IN TERMS WHICH WOULD FREEZE THE BLOOD IFNOT MASKED BY A BLAND OPTIMISM. BUT IT IS NOT FROM THEM THAT THERECAME THE SINGLE GLIMPSE OF FORBIDDEN EONS WHICH CHILLS ME WHEN I THINKOF IT AND MADDENS ME WHEN I DREAM OF IT. THAT GLIMPSE LIKE ALL DREADGLIMPSES OF TRUTH FLASHED OUT FROM AN ACCIDENTAL PIECING TOGETHER OFSEPARATED THINGSIN THIS CASE AN OLD NEWSPAPER ITEM AND THE NOTES OFA DEAD PROFESSOR. I HOPE THAT NO ONE ELSE WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS PIECINGOUT CERTAINLY IF I LIVE I SHALL NEVER KNOWINGLY SUPPLY A LINK INSO HIDEOUS A CHAIN. I THINK THAT THE PROFESSOR TOO INTENDED TO KEEPSILENT REGARDING THE PART HE KNEW AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE DESTROYED HISNOTES HAD NOT SUDDEN DEATH SEIZED HIM.MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE THING BEGAN IN THE WINTER OF  WITH THE DEATHOF MY GRANDUNCLE GEORGE GAMMELL ANGELL PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF SEMITICLANGUAGES IN BROWN UNIVERSITY PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND. PROFESSORANGELL WAS WIDELY KNOWN AS AN AUTHORITY ON ANCIENT INSCRIPTIONS ANDHAD FREQUENTLY BEEN RESORTED TO BY THE HEADS OF PROMINENT MUSEUMS SOTHAT HIS PASSING AT THE AGE OF NINETYTWO MAY BE RECALLED BY MANY.LOCALLY INTEREST WAS INTENSIFIED BY THE OBSCURITY OF THE CAUSE OFDEATH. THE PROFESSOR HAD BEEN STRICKEN WHILST RETURNING FROM THENEWPORT BOAT FALLING SUDDENLY AS WITNESSES SAID AFTER HAVING BEENJOSTLED BY A NAUTICALLOOKING NEGRO WHO HAD COME FROM ONE OF THE QUEERDARK COURTS ON THE PRECIPITOUS HILLSIDE WHICH FORMED A SHORT CUT FROMTHE WATERFRONT TO THE DECEASEDS HOME IN WILLIAMS STREET. PHYSICIANSWERE UNABLE TO FIND ANY VISIBLE DISORDER BUT CONCLUDED AFTER PERPLEXEDDEBATE THAT SOME OBSCURE LESION OF THE HEART INDUCED BY THE BRISKASCENT OF SO STEEP A HILL BY SO ELDERLY A MAN WAS RESPONSIBLE FORTHE END. AT THE TIME I SAW NO REASON TO DISSENT FROM THIS DICTUM BUTLATTERLY I AM INCLINED TO WONDERAND MORE THAN WONDER.AS MY GRANDUNCLES HEIR AND EXECUTOR FOR HE DIED A CHILDLESS WIDOWERI WAS EXPECTED TO GO OVER HIS PAPERS WITH SOME THOROUGHNESS AND FORTHAT PURPOSE MOVED HIS ENTIRE SET OF FILES AND BOXES TO MY QUARTERS INBOSTON. MUCH OF THE MATERIAL WHICH I CORRELATED WILL BE LATER PUBLISHEDBY THE AMERICAN ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY BUT THERE WAS ONE BOX WHICH IFOUND EXCEEDINGLY PUZZLING AND WHICH I FELT MUCH AVERSE FROM SHOWINGTO OTHER EYES. IT HAD BEEN LOCKED AND I DID NOT FIND THE KEY TILLIT OCCURRED TO ME TO EXAMINE THE PERSONAL RING WHICH THE PROFESSORCARRIED ALWAYS IN HIS POCKET. THEN INDEED I SUCCEEDED IN OPENING ITBUT WHEN I DID SO SEEMED ONLY TO BE CONFRONTED BY A GREATER AND MORECLOSELY LOCKED BARRIER. FOR WHAT COULD BE THE MEANING OF THE QUEER CLAYBASRELIEF AND THE DISJOINTED JOTTINGS RAMBLINGS AND CUTTINGS WHICH IFOUND HAD MY UNCLE IN HIS LATTER YEARS BECOME CREDULOUS OF THE MOSTSUPERFICIAL IMPOSTURES I RESOLVED TO SEARCH OUT THE ECCENTRIC SCULPTORRESPONSIBLE FOR THIS APPARENT DISTURBANCE OF AN OLD MANS PEACE OF MIND.THE BASRELIEF WAS A ROUGH RECTANGLE LESS THAN AN INCH THICK AND ABOUTFIVE BY SIX INCHES IN AREA OBVIOUSLY OF MODERN ORIGIN. ITS DESIGNSHOWEVER WERE FAR FROM MODERN IN ATMOSPHERE AND SUGGESTION FORALTHOUGH THE VAGARIES OF CUBISM AND FUTURISM ARE MANY AND WILD THEY DONOT OFTEN REPRODUCE THAT CRYPTIC REGULARITY WHICH LURKS IN PREHISTORICWRITING. AND WRITING OF SOME KIND THE BULK OF THESE DESIGNS SEEMEDCERTAINLY TO BE THOUGH MY MEMORY DESPITE MUCH FAMILIARITY WITH THEPAPERS AND COLLECTIONS OF MY UNCLE FAILED IN ANY WAY TO IDENTIFY THISPARTICULAR SPECIES OR EVEN HINT AT ITS REMOTEST AFFILIATIONS.ABOVE THESE APPARENT HIEROGLYPHICS WAS A FIGURE OF EVIDENTLY PICTORIALINTENT THOUGH ITS IMPRESSIONISTIC EXECUTION FORBADE A VERY CLEARIDEA OF ITS NATURE. IT SEEMED TO BE A SORT OF MONSTER OR SYMBOLREPRESENTING A MONSTER OF A FORM WHICH ONLY A DISEASED FANCY COULDCONCEIVE. IF I SAY THAT MY SOMEWHAT EXTRAVAGANT IMAGINATION YIELDEDSIMULTANEOUS PICTURES OF AN OCTOPUS A DRAGON AND A HUMAN CARICATUREI SHALL NOT BE UNFAITHFUL TO THE SPIRIT OF THE THING. A PULPYTENTACLED HEAD SURMOUNTED A GROTESQUE AND SCALY BODY WITH RUDIMENTARYWINGS BUT IT WAS THE GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE WHOLE WHICH MADE IT MOSTSHOCKINGLY FRIGHTFUL. BEHIND THE FIGURE WAS A VAGUE SUGGESTION OF ACYCLOPEAN ARCHITECTURAL BACKGROUND.THE WRITING ACCOMPANYING THIS ODDITY WAS ASIDE FROM A STACK OFPRESS CUTTINGS IN PROFESSOR ANGELLS MOST RECENT HAND AND MADE NOPRETENSE TO LITERARY STYLE. WHAT SEEMED TO BE THE MAIN DOCUMENT WASHEADED CTHULHU CULT IN CHARACTERS PAINSTAKINGLY PRINTED TO AVOIDTHE ERRONEOUS READING OF A WORD SO UNHEARDOF. THIS MANUSCRIPT WASDIVIDED INTO TWO SECTIONS THE FIRST OF WHICH WAS HEADED DREAMAND DREAM WORK OF H. A. WILCOX  THOMAS ST. PROVIDENCE R. I. ANDTHE SECOND NARRATIVE OF INSPECTOR JOHN R.

THE CUTTINGS LARGELY ALLUDED TO OUTR MENTAL ILLNESSES ANDOUTBREAKS OF GROUP FOLLY OR MANIA IN THE SPRING OF .                                   THE FIRST HALF OF THE PRINCIPAL MANUSCRIPT TOLD A VERY PECULIARTALE. IT APPEARS THAT ON MARCH ST  A THIN DARK YOUNG MAN OFNEUROTIC AND EXCITED ASPECT HAD CALLED UPON PROFESSOR ANGELL BEARINGTHE SINGULAR CLAY BASRELIEF WHICH WAS THEN EXCEEDINGLY DAMP ANDFRESH. HIS CARD BORE THE NAME OF HENRY ANTHONY WILCOX AND MY UNCLEHAD RECOGNIZED HIM AS THE YOUNGEST SON OF AN EXCELLENT FAMILY SLIGHTLYKNOWN TO HIM WHO HAD LATTERLY BEEN STUDYING SCULPTURE AT THE RHODEISLAND SCHOOL OF DESIGN AND LIVING ALONE AT THE FLEURDELYS BUILDINGNEAR THAT INSTITUTION. WILCOX WAS A PRECOCIOUS YOUTH OF KNOWN GENIUSBUT GREAT ECCENTRICITY AND HAD FROM CHILDHOOD EXCITED ATTENTIONTHROUGH THE STRANGE STORIES AND ODD DREAMS HE WAS IN THE HABIT OFRELATING. HE CALLED HIMSELF PSYCHICALLY HYPERSENSITIVE BUT THE STAIDFOLK OF THE ANCIENT COMMERCIAL CITY DISMISSED HIM AS MERELY QUEER.NEVER MINGLING MUCH WITH HIS KIND HE HAD DROPPED GRADUALLY FROM SOCIALVISIBILITY AND WAS NOW KNOWN ONLY TO A SMALL GROUP OF ESTHETES FROMOTHER TOWNS. EVEN THE PROVIDENCE ART CLUB ANXIOUS TO PRESERVE ITSCONSERVATISM HAD FOUND HIM QUITE HOPELESS.ON THE OCCASION OF THE VISIT RAN THE PROFESSORS MANUSCRIPT THESCULPTOR ABRUPTLY ASKED FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS HOSTS ARCHEOLOGICALKNOWLEDGE IN IDENTIFYING THE HIEROGLYPHICS ON THE BASRELIEF. HESPOKE IN A DREAMY STILTED MANNER WHICH SUGGESTED POSE AND ALIENATEDSYMPATHY AND MY UNCLE SHOWED SOME SHARPNESS IN REPLYING FOR THECONSPICUOUS FRESHNESS OF THE TABLET IMPLIED KINSHIP WITH ANYTHING BUTARCHEOLOGY. YOUNG WILCOXS REJOINDER WHICH IMPRESSED MY UNCLE ENOUGHTO MAKE HIM RECALL AND RECORD IT VERBATIM WAS OF A FANTASTICALLYPOETIC CAST WHICH MUST HAVE TYPIFIED HIS WHOLE CONVERSATION AND WHICHI HAVE SINCE FOUND HIGHLY CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM. HE SAID IT IS NEWINDEED FOR I MADE IT LAST NIGHT IN A DREAM OF STRANGE CITIES ANDDREAMS ARE OLDER THAN BROODING TYRE OR THE CONTEMPLATIVE SPHINX ORGARDENGIRDLED BABYLON.IT WAS THEN THAT HE BEGAN THAT RAMBLING TALE WHICH SUDDENLY PLAYED UPONA SLEEPING MEMORY AND WON THE FEVERED INTEREST OF MY UNCLE. THERE HADBEEN A SLIGHT EARTHQUAKE TREMOR THE NIGHT BEFORE THE MOST CONSIDERABLEFELT IN NEW ENGLAND FOR SOME YEARS AND WILCOXS IMAGINATION HAD BEENKEENLY AFFECTED. UPON RETIRING HE HAD HAD AN UNPRECEDENTED DREAM OFGREAT CYCLOPEAN CITIES OF TITAN BLOCKS AND SKYFLUNG MONOLITHS ALLDRIPPING WITH GREEN OOZE AND SINISTER WITH LATENT HORROR. HIEROGLYPHICSHAD COVERED THE WALLS AND PILLARS AND FROM SOME UNDETERMINED POINTBELOW HAD COME A VOICE THAT WAS NOT A VOICE A CHAOTIC SENSATION WHICHONLY FANCY COULD TRANSMUTE INTO SOUND BUT WHICH HE ATTEMPTED TO RENDERBY THE ALMOST UNPRONOUNCEABLE JUMBLE OF LETTERS CTHULHU FHTAGN.THIS VERBAL JUMBLE WAS THE KEY TO THE RECOLLECTION WHICH EXCITED ANDDISTURBED PROFESSOR ANGELL. HE QUESTIONED THE SCULPTOR WITH SCIENTIFICMINUTENESS AND STUDIED WITH ALMOST FRANTIC INTENSITY THE BASRELIEFON WHICH THE YOUTH HAD FOUND HIMSELF WORKING CHILLED AND CLAD ONLYIN HIS NIGHTCLOTHES WHEN WAKING HAD STOLEN BEWILDERINGLY OVER HIM.MY UNCLE BLAMED HIS OLD AGE WILCOX AFTERWARD SAID FOR HIS SLOWNESSIN RECOGNIZING BOTH HIEROGLYPHICS AND PICTORIAL DESIGN. MANY OF HISQUESTIONS SEEMED HIGHLY OUT OF PLACE TO HIS VISITOR ESPECIALLY THOSEWHICH TRIED TO CONNECT THE LATTER WITH STRANGE CULTS OR SOCIETIESAND WILCOX COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE REPEATED PROMISES OF SILENCEWHICH HE WAS OFFERED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN ADMISSION OF MEMBERSHIP INSOME WIDESPREAD MYSTICAL OR PAGANLY RELIGIOUS BODY. WHEN PROFESSORANGELL BECAME CONVINCED THAT THE SCULPTOR WAS INDEED IGNORANT OF ANYCULT OR SYSTEM OF CRYPTIC LORE HE BESIEGED HIS VISITOR WITH DEMANDSFOR FUTURE REPORTS OF DREAMS. THIS BORE REGULAR FRUIT FOR AFTER THEFIRST INTERVIEW THE MANUSCRIPT RECORDS DAILY CALLS OF THE YOUNG MANDURING WHICH HE RELATED STARTLING FRAGMENTS OF NOCTURNAL IMAGERY WHOSEBURDEN WAS ALWAYS SOME TERRIBLE CYCLOPEAN VISTA OF DARK AND DRIPPINGSTONE WITH A SUBTERRENE VOICE OR INTELLIGENCE SHOUTING MONOTONOUSLYIN ENIGMATICAL SENSEIMPACTS UNINSCRIBABLE SAVE AS GIBBERISH. THE TWOSOUNDS MOST FREQUENTLY REPEATED ARE THOSE RENDERED BY THE LETTERSCTHULHU AND RLYEH.ON MARCH RD THE MANUSCRIPT CONTINUED WILCOX FAILED TO APPEAR ANDINQUIRIES AT HIS QUARTERS REVEALED THAT HE HAD BEEN STRICKEN WITH ANOBSCURE SORT OF FEVER AND TAKEN TO THE HOME OF HIS FAMILY IN WATERMANSTREET. HE HAD CRIED OUT IN THE NIGHT AROUSING SEVERAL OTHER ARTISTSIN THE BUILDING AND HAD MANIFESTED SINCE THEN ONLY ALTERNATIONS OFUNCONSCIOUSNESS AND DELIRIUM. MY UNCLE AT ONCE TELEPHONED THE FAMILYAND FROM THAT TIME FORWARD KEPT CLOSE WATCH OF THE CASE CALLINGOFTEN AT THE THAYER STREET OFFICE OF DR. TOBEY WHOM HE LEARNED TOBE IN CHARGE. THE YOUTHS FEBRILE MIND APPARENTLY WAS DWELLING ONSTRANGE THINGS AND THE DOCTOR SHUDDERED NOW AND THEN AS HE SPOKE OFTHEM. THEY INCLUDED NOT ONLY A REPETITION OF WHAT HE HAD FORMERLYDREAMED BUT TOUCHED WILDLY ON A GIGANTIC THING MILES HIGH WHICHWALKED OR LUMBERED ABOUT. HE AT NO TIME FULLY DESCRIBED THIS OBJECTBUT OCCASIONAL FRANTIC WORDS AS REPEATED BY DR. TOBEY CONVINCED THEPROFESSOR THAT IT MUST BE IDENTICAL WITH THE NAMELESS MONSTROSITYHE HAD SOUGHT TO DEPICT IN HIS DREAMSCULPTURE. REFERENCE TO THISOBJECT THE DOCTOR ADDED WAS INVARIABLY A PRELUDE TO THE YOUNG MANSSUBSIDENCE INTO LETHARGY. HIS TEMPERATURE ODDLY ENOUGH WAS NOTGREATLY ABOVE NORMAL BUT THE WHOLE CONDITION WAS OTHERWISE SUCH AS TOSUGGEST TRUE FEVER RATHER THAN MENTAL DISORDER.ON APRIL ND AT ABOUT  P. M. EVERY TRACE OF WILCOXS MALADY SUDDENLYCEASED. HE SAT UPRIGHT IN BED ASTONISHED TO FIND HIMSELF AT HOME ANDCOMPLETELY IGNORANT OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN DREAM OR REALITY SINCE THENIGHT OF MARCH ND. PRONOUNCED WELL BY HIS PHYSICIAN HE RETURNEDTO HIS QUARTERS IN THREE DAYS BUT TO PROFESSOR ANGELL HE WAS OF NOFURTHER ASSISTANCE. ALL TRACES OF STRANGE DREAMING HAD VANISHED WITHHIS RECOVERY AND MY UNCLE KEPT NO RECORD OF HIS NIGHTTHOUGHTS AFTER AWEEK OF POINTLESS AND IRRELEVANT ACCOUNTS OF THOROUGHLY USUAL VISIONS.                                   HERE THE FIRST PART OF THE MANUSCRIPT ENDED BUT REFERENCES TO CERTAINOF THE SCATTERED NOTES GAVE ME MUCH MATERIAL FOR THOUGHTSO MUCH INFACT THAT ONLY THE INGRAINED SKEPTICISM THEN FORMING MY PHILOSOPHYCAN ACCOUNT FOR MY CONTINUED DISTRUST OF THE ARTIST. THE NOTES INQUESTION WERE THOSE DESCRIPTIVE OF THE DREAMS OF VARIOUS PERSONSCOVERING THE SAME PERIOD AS THAT IN WHICH YOUNG WILCOX HAD HAD HISSTRANGE VISITATIONS. MY UNCLE IT SEEMS HAD QUICKLY INSTITUTED APRODIGIOUSLY FARFLUNG BODY OF INQUIRIES AMONGST NEARLY ALL THE FRIENDSWHOM HE COULD QUESTION WITHOUT IMPERTINENCE ASKING FOR NIGHTLY REPORTSOF THEIR DREAMS AND THE DATES OF ANY NOTABLE VISIONS FOR SOME TIMEPAST. THE RECEPTION OF HIS REQUEST SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VARIED BUTHE MUST AT THE VERY LEAST HAVE RECEIVED MORE RESPONSES THAN ANYORDINARY MAN COULD HAVE HANDLED WITHOUT A SECRETARY. THIS ORIGINALCORRESPONDENCE WAS NOT PRESERVED BUT HIS NOTES FORMED A THOROUGH ANDREALLY SIGNIFICANT DIGEST. AVERAGE PEOPLE IN SOCIETY AND BUSINESSNEWENGLANDS TRADITIONAL SALT OF THE EARTHGAVE AN ALMOST COMPLETELYNEGATIVE RESULT THOUGH SCATTERED CASES OF UNEASY BUT FORMLESSNOCTURNAL IMPRESSIONS APPEAR HERE AND THERE ALWAYS BETWEEN MARCHRD AND APRIL NDTHE PERIOD OF YOUNG WILCOXS DELIRIUM. SCIENTIFICMEN WERE LITTLE MORE AFFECTED THOUGH FOUR CASES OF VAGUE DESCRIPTIONSUGGEST FUGITIVE GLIMPSES OF STRANGE LANDSCAPES AND IN ONE CASE THEREIS MENTIONED A DREAD OF SOMETHING ABNORMAL.IT WAS FROM THE ARTISTS AND POETS THAT THE PERTINENT ANSWERS CAMEAND I KNOW THAT PANIC WOULD HAVE BROKEN LOOSE HAD THEY BEEN ABLE TOCOMPARE NOTES. AS IT WAS LACKING THEIR ORIGINAL LETTERS I HALFSUSPECTED THE COMPILER OF HAVING ASKED LEADING QUESTIONS OR OF HAVINGEDITED THE CORRESPONDENCE IN CORROBORATION OF WHAT HE HAD LATENTLYRESOLVED TO SEE. THAT IS WHY I CONTINUED TO FEEL THAT WILCOX SOMEHOWCOGNIZANT OF THE OLD DATA WHICH MY UNCLE HAD POSSESSED HAD BEENIMPOSING ON THE VETERAN SCIENTIST. THESE RESPONSES FROM ESTHETES TOLDA DISTURBING TALE. FROM FEBRUARY TH TO APRIL ND A LARGE PROPORTIONOF THEM HAD DREAMED VERY BIZARRE THINGS THE INTENSITY OF THE DREAMSBEING IMMEASURABLY THE STRONGER DURING THE PERIOD OF THE SCULPTORSDELIRIUM. OVER A FOURTH OF THOSE WHO REPORTED ANYTHING REPORTEDSCENES AND HALFSOUNDS NOT UNLIKE THOSE WHICH WILCOX HAD DESCRIBEDAND SOME OF THE DREAMERS CONFESSED ACUTE FEAR OF THE GIGANTIC NAMELESSTHING VISIBLE TOWARD THE LAST. ONE CASE WHICH THE NOTE DESCRIBES WITHEMPHASIS WAS VERY SAD. THE SUBJECT A WIDELY KNOWN ARCHITECT WITHLEANINGS TOWARD THEOSOPHY AND OCCULTISM WENT VIOLENTLY INSANE ONTHE DATE OF YOUNG WILCOXS SEIZURE AND EXPIRED SEVERAL MONTHS LATERAFTER INCESSANT SCREAMINGS TO BE SAVED FROM SOME ESCAPED DENIZEN OFHELL. HAD MY UNCLE REFERRED TO THESE CASES BY NAME INSTEAD OF MERELYBY NUMBER I SHOULD HAVE ATTEMPTED SOME CORROBORATION AND PERSONALINVESTIGATION BUT AS IT WAS I SUCCEEDED IN TRACING DOWN ONLY AFEW. ALL OF THESE HOWEVER BORE OUT THE NOTES IN FULL. I HAVE OFTENWONDERED IF ALL THE OBJECTS OF THE PROFESSORS QUESTIONING FELT ASPUZZLED AS DID THIS FRACTION. IT IS WELL THAT NO EXPLANATION SHALL EVERREACH THEM.THE PRESS CUTTINGS AS I HAVE INTIMATED TOUCHED ON CASES OF PANICMANIA AND ECCENTRICITY DURING THE GIVEN PERIOD. PROFESSOR ANGELLMUST HAVE EMPLOYED A CUTTING BUREAU FOR THE NUMBER OF EXTRACTS WASTREMENDOUS AND THE SOURCES SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE. HEREWAS A NOCTURNAL SUICIDE IN LONDON WHERE A LONE SLEEPER HAD LEAPEDFROM A WINDOW AFTER A SHOCKING CRY. HERE LIKEWISE A RAMBLING LETTERTO THE EDITOR OF A PAPER IN SOUTH AMERICA WHERE A FANATIC DEDUCESA DIRE FUTURE FROM VISIONS HE HAS SEEN.

AND SO NUMEROUS ARE THE RECORDED TROUBLES IN INSANEASYLUMS THAT ONLY A MIRACLE CAN HAVE STOPPED THE MEDICAL FRATERNITYFROM NOTING STRANGE PARALLELISMS AND DRAWING MYSTIFIED CONCLUSIONS.A WEIRD BUNCH OF CUTTINGS ALL TOLD AND I CAN AT THIS DATE SCARCELYENVISAGE THE CALLOUS RATIONALISM WITH WHICH I SET THEM ASIDE. BUT IWAS THEN CONVINCED THAT YOUNG WILCOX HAD KNOWN OF THE OLDER MATTERSMENTIONED BY THE PROFESSOR.                 . THE TALE OF INSPECTOR LEGRASSE.THE OLDER MATTERS WHICH HAD MADE THE SCULPTORS DREAM AND BASRELIEF SOSIGNIFICANT TO MY UNCLE FORMED THE SUBJECT OF THE SECOND HALF OF HISLONG MANUSCRIPT. ONCE BEFORE IT APPEARS PROFESSOR ANGELL HAD SEEN THEHELLISH OUTLINES OF THE NAMELESS MONSTROSITY PUZZLED OVER THE UNKNOWNHIEROGLYPHICS AND HEARD THE OMINOUS SYLLABLES WHICH CAN BE RENDEREDONLY AS CTHULHU AND ALL THIS IN SO STIRRING AND HORRIBLE ACONNECTION THAT IT IS SMALL WONDER HE PURSUED YOUNG WILCOX WITH QUERIESAND DEMANDS FOR DATA.THIS EARLIER EXPERIENCE HAD COME IN  SEVENTEEN YEARS BEFOREWHEN THE AMERICAN ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY HELD ITS ANNUAL MEETING INST. LOUIS. PROFESSOR ANGELL AS BEFITTED ONE OF HIS AUTHORITY ANDATTAINMENTS HAD HAD A PROMINENT PART IN ALL THE DELIBERATIONS AND WASONE OF THE FIRST TO BE APPROACHED BY THE SEVERAL OUTSIDERS WHO TOOKADVANTAGE OF THE CONVOCATION TO OFFER QUESTIONS FOR CORRECT ANSWERINGAND PROBLEMS FOR EXPERT SOLUTION.THE CHIEF OF THESE OUTSIDERS AND IN A SHORT TIME THE FOCUS OF INTERESTFOR THE ENTIRE MEETING WAS A COMMONPLACELOOKING MIDDLEAGED MANWHO HAD TRAVELED ALL THE WAY FROM NEW ORLEANS FOR CERTAIN SPECIALINFORMATION UNOBTAINABLE FROM ANY LOCAL SOURCE. HIS NAME WAS JOHNRAYMOND LEGRASSE AND HE WAS BY PROFESSION AN INSPECTOR OF POLICE. WITHHIM HE BORE THE SUBJECT OF HIS VISIT A GROTESQUE REPULSIVE ANDAPPARENTLY VERY ANCIENT STONE STATUETTE WHOSE ORIGIN HE WAS AT A LOSSTO DETERMINE.IT MUST NOT BE FANCIED THAT INSPECTOR LEGRASSE HAD THE LEAST INTERESTIN ARCHEOLOGY. ON THE CONTRARY HIS WISH FOR ENLIGHTENMENT WAS PROMPTEDBY PURELY PROFESSIONAL CONSIDERATIONS. THE STATUETTE IDOL FETISHOR WHATEVER IT WAS HAD BEEN CAPTURED SOME MONTHS BEFORE IN THEWOODED SWAMPS SOUTH OF NEW ORLEANS DURING A RAID ON A SUPPOSED VOODOOMEETING AND SO SINGULAR AND HIDEOUS WERE THE RITES CONNECTED WITHIT THAT THE POLICE COULD NOT BUT REALIZE THAT THEY HAD STUMBLED ON ADARK CULT TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO THEM AND INFINITELY MORE DIABOLIC THANEVEN THE BLACKEST OF THE AFRICAN VOODOO CIRCLES. OF ITS ORIGIN APARTFROM THE ERRATIC AND UNBELIEVABLE TALES EXTORTED FROM THE CAPTUREDMEMBERS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WAS TO BE DISCOVERED HENCE THE ANXIETYOF THE POLICE FOR ANY ANTIQUARIAN LORE WHICH MIGHT HELP THEM TO PLACETHE FRIGHTFUL SYMBOL AND THROUGH IT TRACK DOWN THE CULT TO ITSFOUNTAINHEAD.INSPECTOR LEGRASSE WAS SCARCELY PREPARED FOR THE SENSATION WHICH HISOFFERING CREATED. ONE SIGHT OF THE THING HAD BEEN ENOUGH TO THROW THEASSEMBLED MEN OF SCIENCE INTO A STATE OF TENSE EXCITEMENT AND THEYLOST NO TIME IN CROWDING AROUND HIM TO GAZE AT THE DIMINUTIVE FIGUREWHOSE UTTER STRANGENESS AND AIR OF GENUINELY ABYSMAL ANTIQUITY HINTEDSO POTENTLY AT UNOPENED AND ARCHAIC VISTAS. NO RECOGNIZED SCHOOL OFSCULPTURE HAD ANIMATED THIS TERRIBLE OBJECT YET CENTURIES AND EVENTHOUSANDS OF YEARS SEEMED RECORDED IN ITS DIM AND GREENISH SURFACE OFUNPLACEABLE STONE.THE FIGURE WHICH WAS FINALLY PASSED SLOWLY FROM MAN TO MAN FOR CLOSEAND CAREFUL STUDY WAS BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT INCHES IN HEIGHT AND OFEXQUISITELY ARTISTIC WORKMANSHIP. IT REPRESENTED A MONSTER OF VAGUELYANTHROPOID OUTLINE BUT WITH AN OCTOPUSLIKE HEAD WHOSE FACE WAS A MASSOF FEELERS A SCALY RUBBERYLOOKING BODY PRODIGIOUS CLAWS ON HINDAND FORE FEET AND LONG NARROW WINGS BEHIND. THIS THING WHICH SEEMEDINSTINCT WITH A FEARSOME AND UNNATURAL MALIGNANCY WAS OF A SOMEWHATBLOATED CORPULENCE AND SQUATTED EVILLY ON A RECTANGULAR BLOCK ORPEDESTAL COVERED WITH UNDECIPHERABLE CHARACTERS. THE TIPS OF THE WINGSTOUCHED THE BACK EDGE OF THE BLOCK THE SEAT OCCUPIED THE CENTERWHILST THE LONG CURVED CLAWS OF THE DOUBLEDUP CROUCHING HIND LEGSGRIPPED THE FRONT EDGE AND EXTENDED A QUARTER OF THE WAY DOWN TOWARDTHE BOTTOM OF THE PEDESTAL. THE CEPHALOPOD HEAD WAS BENT FORWARD SOTHAT THE ENDS OF THE FACIAL FEELERS BRUSHED THE BACKS OF HUGE FOREPAWSWHICH CLASPED THE CROUCHERS ELEVATED KNEES. THE ASPECT OF THE WHOLEWAS ABNORMALLY LIFELIKE AND THE MORE SUBTLY FEARFUL BECAUSE ITS SOURCEWAS SO TOTALLY UNKNOWN. ITS VAST AWESOME AND INCALCULABLE AGE WASUNMISTAKABLE YET NOT ONE LINK DID IT SHOW WITH ANY KNOWN TYPE OF ARTBELONGING TO CIVILIZATIONS YOUTHOR INDEED TO ANY OTHER TIME.TOTALLY SEPARATE AND APART ITS VERY MATERIAL WAS A MYSTERY FOR THESOAPY GREENISHBLACK STONE WITH ITS GOLDEN OR IRIDESCENT FLECKS ANDSTRIATIONS RESEMBLED NOTHING FAMILIAR TO GEOLOGY OR MINERALOGY. THECHARACTERS ALONG THE BASE WERE EQUALLY BAFFLING AND NO MEMBER PRESENTDESPITE A REPRESENTATION OF HALF THE WORLDS EXPERT LEARNING IN THISFIELD COULD FORM THE LEAST NOTION OF EVEN THEIR REMOTEST LINGUISTICKINSHIP. THEY LIKE THE SUBJECT AND MATERIAL BELONGED TO SOMETHINGHORRIBLY REMOTE AND DISTINCT FROM MANKIND AS WE KNOW IT SOMETHINGFRIGHTFULLY SUGGESTIVE OF OLD AND UNHALLOWED CYCLES OF LIFE IN WHICHOUR WORLD AND OUR CONCEPTIONS HAVE NO PART.AND YET AS THE MEMBERS SEVERALLY SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND CONFESSEDDEFEAT AT THE INSPECTORS PROBLEM THERE WAS ONE MAN IN THAT GATHERINGWHO SUSPECTED A TOUCH OF BIZARRE FAMILIARITY IN THE MONSTROUS SHAPE ANDWRITING AND WHO PRESENTLY TOLD WITH SOME DIFFIDENCE OF THE ODD TRIFLEHE KNEW. THIS PERSON WAS THE LATE WILLIAM CHANNING WEBB PROFESSOR OFANTHROPOLOGY IN PRINCETON UNIVERSITY AND AN EXPLORER OF NO SLIGHT NOTE.PROFESSOR WEBB HAD BEEN ENGAGED FORTYEIGHT YEARS BEFORE IN A TOUROF GREENLAND AND ICELAND IN SEARCH OF SOME RUNIC INSCRIPTIONS WHICHHE FAILED TO UNEARTH AND WHILST HIGH UP ON THE WEST GREENLAND COASTHAD ENCOUNTERED A SINGULAR TRIBE OR CULT OF DEGENERATE ESKIMOS WHOSERELIGION A CURIOUS FORM OF DEVILWORSHIP CHILLED HIM WITH ITSDELIBERATE BLOODTHIRSTINESS AND REPULSIVENESS. IT WAS A FAITH OF WHICHOTHER ESKIMOS KNEW LITTLE AND WHICH THEY MENTIONED ONLY WITH SHUDDERSSAYING THAT IT HAD COME DOWN FROM HORRIBLY ANCIENT EONS BEFORE EVER THEWORLD WAS MADE. BESIDES NAMELESS RITES AND HUMAN SACRIFICES THERE WERECERTAIN QUEER HEREDITARY RITUALS ADDRESSED TO A SUPREME ELDER DEVIL ORTORNASUK AND OF THIS PROFESSOR WEBB HAD TAKEN A CAREFUL PHONETICCOPY FROM AN AGED ANGEKOK OR WIZARDPRIEST EXPRESSING THE SOUNDS INROMAN LETTERS AS BEST HE KNEW HOW. BUT JUST NOW OF PRIME SIGNIFICANCEWAS THE FETISH WHICH THIS CULT HAD CHERISHED AND AROUND WHICH THEYDANCED WHEN THE AURORA LEAPED HIGH OVER THE ICE CLIFFS. IT WAS THEPROFESSOR STATED A VERY CRUDE BASRELIEF OF STONE COMPRISING AHIDEOUS PICTURE AND SOME CRYPTIC WRITING. AND AS FAR AS HE COULD TELLIT WAS A ROUGH PARALLEL IN ALL ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF THE BESTIAL THINGNOW LYING BEFORE THE MEETING.THESE DATA RECEIVED WITH SUSPENSE AND ASTONISHMENT BY THE ASSEMBLEDMEMBERS PROVED DOUBLY EXCITING TO INSPECTOR LEGRASSE AND HE BEGAN ATONCE TO PLY HIS INFORMANT WITH QUESTIONS. HAVING NOTED AND COPIED ANORAL RITUAL AMONG THE SWAMP CULTWORSHIPERS HIS MEN HAD ARRESTED HEBESOUGHT THE PROFESSOR TO REMEMBER AS BEST HE MIGHT THE SYLLABLES TAKENDOWN AMONGST THE DIABOLIST ESKIMOS. THERE THEN FOLLOWED AN EXHAUSTIVECOMPARISON OF DETAILS AND A MOMENT OF REALLY AWED SILENCE WHEN BOTHDETECTIVE AND SCIENTIST AGREED ON THE VIRTUAL IDENTITY OF THE PHRASECOMMON TO TWO HELLISH RITUALS SO MANY WORLDS OF DISTANCE APART. WHATIN SUBSTANCE BOTH THE ESKIMO WIZARDS AND THE LOUISIANA SWAMPPRIESTSHAD CHANTED TO THEIR KINDRED IDOLS WAS SOMETHING VERY LIKE THISTHEWORDDIVISIONS BEING GUESSED AT FROM TRADITIONAL BREAKS IN THE PHRASEAS CHANTED ALOUD        PHNGLUI MGLWNAFH CTHULHU RLYEH WGAHNAGL FHTAGN.LEGRASSE HAD ONE POINT IN ADVANCE OF PROFESSOR WEBB FOR SEVERAL AMONGHIS MONGREL PRISONERS HAD REPEATED TO HIM WHAT OLDER CELEBRANTS HADTOLD THEM THE WORDS MEANT. THIS TEXT AS GIVEN RAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS         IN HIS HOUSE AT RLYEH DEAD CTHULHU WAITS DREAMING.                                   AND NOW IN RESPONSE TO A GENERAL URGENT DEMAND INSPECTOR LEGRASSERELATED AS FULLY AS POSSIBLE HIS EXPERIENCE WITH THE SWAMP WORSHIPERSTELLING A STORY TO WHICH I COULD SEE MY UNCLE ATTACHED PROFOUNDSIGNIFICANCE. IT SAVORED OF THE WILDEST DREAMS OF MYTHMAKER ANDTHEOSOPHIST AND DISCLOSED AN ASTONISHING DEGREE OF COSMIC IMAGINATIONAMONG SUCH HALFCASTES AND PARIAHS AS MIGHT BE LEAST EXPECTED TOPOSSESS IT.ON NOVEMBER ST  THERE HAD COME TO NEW ORLEANS POLICE A FRANTICSUMMONS FROM THE SWAMP AND LAGOON COUNTRY TO THE SOUTH. THE SQUATTERSTHERE MOSTLY PRIMITIVE BUT GOODNATURED DESCENDANTS OF LAFITTES MENWERE IN THE GRIP OF STARK TERROR FROM AN UNKNOWN THING WHICH HAD STOLENUPON THEM IN THE NIGHT. IT WAS VOODOO APPARENTLY BUT VOODOO OF A MORETERRIBLE SORT THAN THEY HAD EVER KNOWN AND SOME OF THEIR WOMEN ANDCHILDREN HAD DISAPPEARED SINCE THE MALEVOLENT TOMTOM HAD BEGUN ITSINCESSANT BEATING FAR WITHIN THE BLACK HAUNTED WOODS WHERE NO DWELLERVENTURED. THERE WERE INSANE SHOUTS AND HARROWING SCREAMS SOULCHILLINGCHANTS AND DANCING DEVILFLAMES AND THE FRIGHTENED MESSENGER ADDEDTHE PEOPLE COULD STAND IT NO MORE.SO A BODY OF TWENTY POLICE FILLING TWO CARRIAGES AND AN AUTOMOBILEHAD SET OUT IN THE LATE AFTERNOON WITH THE SHIVERING SQUATTER AS AGUIDE. AT THE END OF THE PASSABLE ROAD THEY ALIGHTED AND FOR MILESSPLASHED ON IN SILENCE THROUGH THE TERRIBLE CYPRESS WOODS WHERE DAYNEVER CAME. UGLY ROOTS AND MALIGNANT HANGING NOOSES OF SPANISH MOSSBESET THEM AND NOW AND THEN A PILE OF DANK STONES OR FRAGMENTS OF AROTTING WALL INTENSIFIED BY ITS HINT OF MORBID HABITATION A DEPRESSIONWHICH EVERY MALFORMED TREE AND EVERY FUNGOUS ISLET COMBINED TO CREATE.AT LENGTH THE SQUATTER SETTLEMENT A MISERABLE HUDDLE OF HUTS HOVE INSIGHT AND HYSTERICAL DWELLERS RAN OUT TO CLUSTER AROUND THE GROUP OFBOBBING LANTERNS. THE MUFFLED BEAT OF TOMTOMS WAS NOW FAINTLY AUDIBLEFAR FAR AHEAD AND A CURDLING SHRIEK CAME AT INFREQUENT INTERVALSWHEN THE WIND SHIFTED. A REDDISH GLARE TOO SEEMED TO FILTER THROUGHTHE PALE UNDERGROWTH BEYOND ENDLESS AVENUES OF FOREST NIGHT. RELUCTANTEVEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AGAIN EACH ONE OF THE COWED SQUATTERS REFUSEDPOINTBLANK TO ADVANCE ANOTHER INCH TOWARD THE SCENE OF UNHOLYWORSHIP SO INSPECTOR LEGRASSE AND HIS NINETEEN COLLEAGUES PLUNGED ONUNGUIDED INTO BLACK ARCADES OF HORROR THAT NONE OF THEM HAD EVER TRODBEFORE.THE REGION NOW ENTERED BY THE POLICE WAS ONE OF TRADITIONALLY EVILREPUTE SUBSTANTIALLY UNKNOWN AND UNTRAVERSED BY WHITE MEN. THERE WERELEGENDS OF A HIDDEN LAKE UNGLIMPSED BY MORTAL SIGHT IN WHICH DWELT AHUGE FORMLESS WHITE POLYPOUS THING WITH LUMINOUS EYES AND SQUATTERSWHISPERED THAT BATWINGED DEVILS FLEW UP OUT OF CAVERNS IN INNEREARTH TO WORSHIP IT AT MIDNIGHT. THEY SAID IT HAD BEEN THERE BEFOREDIBERVILLE BEFORE LA SALLE BEFORE THE INDIANS AND BEFORE EVEN THEWHOLESOME BEASTS AND BIRDS OF THE WOODS. IT WAS NIGHTMARE ITSELF ANDTO SEE IT WAS TO DIE. BUT IT MADE MEN DREAM AND SO THEY KNEW ENOUGH TOKEEP AWAY. THE PRESENT VOODOO ORGY WAS INDEED ON THE MEREST FRINGEOF THIS ABHORRED AREA BUT THAT LOCATION WAS BAD ENOUGH HENCE PERHAPSTHE VERY PLACE OF THE WORSHIP HAD TERRIFIED THE SQUATTERS MORE THAN THESHOCKING SOUNDS AND INCIDENTS.ONLY POETRY OR MADNESS COULD DO JUSTICE TO THE NOISES HEARD BYLEGRASSES MEN AS THEY PLOWED ON THROUGH THE BLACK MORASS TOWARD THERED GLARE AND THE MUFFLED TOMTOMS. THERE ARE VOCAL QUALITIES PECULIARTO MEN AND VOCAL QUALITIES PECULIAR TO BEASTS AND IT IS TERRIBLETO HEAR THE ONE WHEN THE SOURCE SHOULD YIELD THE OTHER. ANIMAL FURYAND ORGIASTIC LICENSE HERE WHIPPED THEMSELVES TO DEMONIAC HEIGHTS BYHOWLS AND SQUAWKING ECSTASIES THAT TORE AND REVERBERATED THROUGH THOSENIGHTED WOODS LIKE PESTILENTIAL TEMPESTS FROM THE GULFS OF HELL. NOWAND THEN THE LESS ORGANIZED ULULATIONS WOULD CEASE AND FROM WHATSEEMED A WELLDRILLED CHORUS OF HOARSE VOICES WOULD RISE IN SINGSONGCHANT THAT HIDEOUS PHRASE OR RITUAL        PHNGLUI MGLWNAFH CTHULHU RLYEH WGAHNAGL FHTAGN.THEN THE MEN HAVING REACHED A SPOT WHERE THE TREES WERE THINNER CAMESUDDENLY IN SIGHT OF THE SPECTACLE ITSELF. FOUR OF THEM REELED ONEFAINTED AND TWO WERE SHAKEN INTO A FRANTIC CRY WHICH THE MAD CACOPHONYOF THE ORGY FORTUNATELY DEADENED. LEGRASSE DASHED SWAMP WATER ON THEFACE OF THE FAINTING MAN AND ALL STOOD TREMBLING AND NEARLY HYPNOTIZEDWITH HORROR.IN A NATURAL GLADE OF THE SWAMP STOOD A GRASSY ISLAND OF PERHAPS ANACRES EXTENT CLEAR OF TREES AND TOLERABLY DRY. ON THIS NOW LEAPED ANDTWISTED A MORE INDESCRIBABLE HORDE OF HUMAN ABNORMALITY THAN ANY BUT ASIME OR AN ANGAROLA COULD PAINT. VOID OF CLOTHING THIS HYBRID SPAWNWERE BRAYING BELLOWING AND WRITHING ABOUT A MONSTROUS RINGSHAPEDBONFIRE IN THE CENTER OF WHICH REVEALED BY OCCASIONAL RIFTS IN THECURTAIN OF FLAME STOOD A GREAT GRANITE MONOLITH SOME EIGHT FEET INHEIGHT ON TOP OF WHICH INCONGRUOUS IN ITS DIMINUTIVENESS RESTED THENOXIOUS CARVEN STATUETTE. FROM A WIDE CIRCLE OF TEN SCAFFOLDS SET UPAT REGULAR INTERVALS WITH THE FLAMEGIRT MONOLITH AS A CENTER HUNGHEAD DOWNWARD THE ODDLY MARRED BODIES OF THE HELPLESS SQUATTERS WHOHAD DISAPPEARED. IT WAS INSIDE THIS CIRCLE THAT THE RING OF WORSHIPERSJUMPED AND ROARED THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE MASS MOTION BEING FROMLEFT TO RIGHT IN ENDLESS BACCHANALE BETWEEN THE RING OF BODIES AND THERING OF FIRE.IT MAY HAVE BEEN ONLY IMAGINATION AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN ONLY ECHOESWHICH INDUCED ONE OF THE MEN AN EXCITABLE SPANIARD TO FANCY HE HEARDANTIPHONAL RESPONSES TO THE RITUAL FROM SOME FAR AND UNILLUMINED SPOTDEEPER WITHIN THE WOOD OF ANCIENT LEGENDRY AND HORROR. THIS MAN JOSEPHD. GALVEZ I LATER MET AND QUESTIONED AND HE PROVED DISTRACTINGLYIMAGINATIVE. HE INDEED WENT SO FAR AS TO HINT OF THE FAINT BEATING OFGREAT WINGS AND OF A GLIMPSE OF SHINING EYES AND A MOUNTAINOUS WHITEBULK BEYOND THE REMOTEST TREESBUT I SUPPOSE HE HAD BEEN HEARING TOOMUCH NATIVE SUPERSTITION.ACTUALLY THE HORRIFIED PAUSE OF THE MEN WAS OF COMPARATIVELY BRIEFDURATION. DUTY CAME FIRST AND ALTHOUGH THERE MUST HAVE BEEN NEARLY AHUNDRED MONGREL CELEBRANTS IN THE THRONG THE POLICE RELIED ON THEIRFIREARMS AND PLUNGED DETERMINEDLY INTO THE NAUSEOUS ROUT. FOR FIVEMINUTES THE RESULTANT DIN AND CHAOS WERE BEYOND DESCRIPTION. WILDBLOWS WERE STRUCK SHOTS WERE FIRED AND ESCAPES WERE MADE BUT INTHE END LEGRASSE WAS ABLE TO COUNT SOME FORTYSEVEN SULLEN PRISONERSWHOM HE FORCED TO DRESS IN HASTE AND FALL INTO LINE BETWEEN TWO ROWSOF POLICEMEN. FIVE OF THE WORSHIPERS LAY DEAD AND TWO SEVERELYWOUNDED ONES WERE CARRIED AWAY ON IMPROVISED STRETCHERS BY THEIRFELLOWPRISONERS. THE IMAGE ON THE MONOLITH OF COURSE WAS CAREFULLYREMOVED AND CARRIED BACK BY LEGRASSE.EXAMINED AT HEADQUARTERS AFTER A TRIP OF INTENSE STRAIN AND WEARINESSTHE PRISONERS ALL PROVED TO BE MEN OF A VERY LOW MIXEDBLOODED ANDMENTALLY ABERRANT TYPE. MOST WERE SEAMEN AND A SPRINKLING OF NEGROESAND MULATTOES LARGELY WEST INDIANS OR BRAVA PORTUGUESE FROM THE CAPEVERDE ISLANDS GAVE A COLORING OF VOODOOISM TO THE HETEROGENEOUS CULT.BUT BEFORE MANY QUESTIONS WERE ASKED IT BECAME MANIFEST THAT SOMETHINGFAR DEEPER AND OLDER THAN NEGRO FETISHISM WAS INVOLVED. DEGRADED ANDIGNORANT AS THEY WERE THE CREATURES HELD WITH SURPRIZING CONSISTENCYTO THE CENTRAL IDEA OF THEIR LOATHSOME FAITH.THEY WORSHIPED SO THEY SAID THE GREAT OLD ONES WHO LIVED AGES BEFORETHERE WERE ANY MEN AND WHO CAME TO THE YOUNG WORLD OUT OF THE SKY.THOSE OLD ONES WERE GONE NOW INSIDE THE EARTH AND UNDER THE SEA BUTTHEIR DEAD BODIES HAD TOLD THEIR SECRETS IN DREAMS TO THE FIRST MANWHO FORMED A CULT WHICH HAD NEVER DIED. THIS WAS THAT CULT AND THEPRISONERS SAID IT HAD ALWAYS EXISTED AND ALWAYS WOULD EXIST HIDDEN INDISTANT WASTES AND DARK PLACES ALL OVER THE WORLD UNTIL THE TIME WHENTHE GREAT PRIEST CTHULHU FROM HIS DARK HOUSE IN THE MIGHTY CITY OFRLYEH UNDER THE WATERS SHOULD RISE AND BRING THE EARTH AGAIN BENEATHHIS SWAY. SOME DAY HE WOULD CALL WHEN THE STARS WERE READY AND THESECRET CULT WOULD ALWAYS BE WAITING TO LIBERATE HIM.MEANWHILE NO MORE MUST BE TOLD. THERE WAS A SECRET WHICH EVEN TORTURECOULD NOT EXTRACT. MANKIND WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY ALONE AMONG THE CONSCIOUSTHINGS OF EARTH FOR SHAPES CAME OUT OF THE DARK TO VISIT THE FAITHFULFEW. BUT THESE WERE NOT THE GREAT OLD ONES. NO MAN HAD EVER SEEN THEOLD ONES. THE CARVEN IDOL WAS GREAT CTHULHU BUT NONE MIGHT SAY WHETHEROR NOT THE OTHERS WERE PRECISELY LIKE HIM. NO ONE COULD READ THE OLDWRITING NOW BUT THINGS WERE TOLD BY WORD OF MOUTH. THE CHANTED RITUALWAS NOT THE SECRETTHAT WAS NEVER SPOKEN ALOUD ONLY WHISPERED. THECHANT MEANT ONLY THIS IN HIS HOUSE AT RLYEH DEAD CTHULHU WAITSDREAMING.                                   ONLY TWO OF THE PRISONERS WERE FOUND SANE ENOUGH TO BE HANGED ANDTHE REST WERE COMMITTED TO VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS. ALL DENIED A PARTIN THE RITUAL MURDERS AND AVERRED THAT THE KILLING HAD BEEN DONEBY BLACKWINGED ONES WHICH HAD COME TO THEM FROM THEIR IMMEMORIALMEETINGPLACE IN THE HAUNTED WOOD. BUT OF THOSE MYSTERIOUS ALLIES NOCOHERENT ACCOUNT COULD EVER BE GAINED. WHAT THE POLICE DID EXTRACTCAME MAINLY FROM AN IMMENSELY AGED MESTIZO NAMED CASTRO WHO CLAIMEDTO HAVE SAILED TO STRANGE PORTS AND TALKED WITH UNDYING LEADERS OF THECULT IN THE MOUNTAINS OF CHINA.OLD CASTRO REMEMBERED BITS OF HIDEOUS LEGEND THAT PALED THESPECULATIONS OF THEOSOPHISTS AND MADE MAN AND THE WORLD SEEM RECENTAND TRANSIENT INDEED. THERE HAD BEEN EONS WHEN OTHER THINGS RULED ONTHE EARTH AND THEY HAD HAD GREAT CITIES. REMAINS OF THEM HE SAID THEDEATHLESS CHINAMEN HAD TOLD HIM WERE STILL TO BE FOUND AS CYCLOPEANSTONES ON ISLANDS IN THE PACIFIC. THEY ALL DIED VAST EPOCHS OF TIMEBEFORE MAN CAME BUT THERE WERE ARTS WHICH COULD REVIVE THEM WHEN THESTARS HAD COME ROUND AGAIN TO THE RIGHT POSITIONS IN THE CYCLE OFETERNITY. THEY HAD INDEED COME THEMSELVES FROM THE STARS AND BROUGHTTHEIR IMAGES WITH THEM.THESE GREAT OLD ONES CASTRO CONTINUED WERE NOT COMPOSED ALTOGETHEROF FLESH AND BLOOD. THEY HAD SHAPEFOR DID NOT THIS STARFASHIONEDIMAGE PROVE ITBUT THAT SHAPE WAS NOT MADE OF MATTER. WHEN THE STARSWERE RIGHT THEY COULD PLUNGE FROM WORLD TO WORLD THROUGH THE SKYBUT WHEN THE STARS WERE WRONG THEY COULD NOT LIVE. BUT ALTHOUGH THEYNO LONGER LIVED THEY WOULD NEVER REALLY DIE. THEY ALL LAY IN STONEHOUSES IN THEIR GREAT CITY OF RLYEH PRESERVED BY THE SPELLS OF MIGHTYCTHULHU FOR A GLORIOUS RESURRECTION WHEN THE STARS AND THE EARTH MIGHTONCE MORE BE READY FOR THEM. BUT AT THAT TIME SOME FORCE FROM OUTSIDEMUST SERVE TO LIBERATE THEIR BODIES. THE SPELLS THAT PRESERVED THEMINTACT LIKEWISE PREVENTED THEM FROM MAKING AN INITIAL MOVE AND THEYCOULD ONLY LIE AWAKE IN THE DARK AND THINK WHILST UNCOUNTED MILLIONSOF YEARS ROLLED BY. THEY KNEW ALL THAT WAS OCCURRING IN THE UNIVERSEFOR THEIR MODE OF SPEECH WAS TRANSMITTED THOUGHT. EVEN NOW THEY TALKEDIN THEIR TOMBS. WHEN AFTER INFINITIES OF CHAOS THE FIRST MEN CAMETHE GREAT OLD ONES SPOKE TO THE SENSITIVE AMONG THEM BY MOLDING THEIRDREAMS FOR ONLY THUS COULD THEIR LANGUAGE REACH THE FLESHLY MINDS OFMAMMALS.THEN WHISPERED CASTRO THOSE FIRST MEN FORMED THE CULT AROUND SMALLIDOLS WHICH THE GREAT ONES SHOWED THEM IDOLS BROUGHT IN DIM ERASFROM DARK STARS. THAT CULT WOULD NEVER DIE TILL THE STARS CAME RIGHTAGAIN AND THE SECRET PRIESTS WOULD TAKE GREAT CTHULHU FROM HIS TOMBTO REVIVE HIS SUBJECTS AND RESUME HIS RULE OF EARTH. THE TIME WOULDBE EASY TO KNOW FOR THEN MANKIND WOULD HAVE BECOME AS THE GREAT OLDONES FREE AND WILD AND BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL WITH LAWS AND MORALSTHROWN ASIDE AND ALL MEN SHOUTING AND KILLING AND REVELING IN JOY. THENTHE LIBERATED OLD ONES WOULD TEACH THEM NEW WAYS TO SHOUT AND KILLAND REVEL AND ENJOY THEMSELVES AND ALL THE EARTH WOULD FLAME WITH AHOLOCAUST OF ECSTASY AND FREEDOM. MEANWHILE THE CULT BY APPROPRIATERITES MUST KEEP ALIVE THE MEMORY OF THOSE ANCIENT WAYS AND SHADOWFORTH THE PROPHECY OF THEIR RETURN.IN THE ELDER TIME CHOSEN MEN HAD TALKED WITH THE ENTOMBED OLD ONES INDREAMS BUT THEN SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED. THE GREAT STONE CITY RLYEHWITH ITS MONOLITHS AND SEPULCHERS HAD SUNK BENEATH THE WAVES AND THEDEEP WATERS FULL OF THE ONE PRIMAL MYSTERY THROUGH WHICH NOT EVENTHOUGHT CAN PASS HAD CUT OFF THE SPECTRAL INTERCOURSE. BUT MEMORYNEVER DIED AND HIGH PRIESTS SAID THAT THE CITY WOULD RISE AGAIN WHENTHE STARS WERE RIGHT. THEN CAME OUT OF THE EARTH THE BLACK SPIRITS OFEARTH MOLDY AND SHADOWY AND FULL OF DIM RUMORS PICKED UP IN CAVERNSBENEATH FORGOTTEN SEABOTTOMS. BUT OF THEM OLD CASTRO DARED NOT SPEAKMUCH. HE CUT HIMSELF OFF HURRIEDLY AND NO AMOUNT OF PERSUASION ORSUBTLETY COULD ELICIT MORE IN THIS DIRECTION. THE SIZE OF THE OLDONES TOO HE CURIOUSLY DECLINED TO MENTION. OF THE CULT HE SAID THATHE THOUGHT THE CENTER LAY AMID THE PATHLESS DESERTS OF ARABIA WHEREIREM THE CITY OF PILLARS DREAMS HIDDEN AND UNTOUCHED. IT WAS NOTALLIED TO THE EUROPEAN WITCHCULT AND WAS VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN BEYOND ITSMEMBERS. NO BOOK HAD EVER REALLY HINTED OF IT THOUGH THE DEATHLESSCHINAMEN SAID THAT THERE WERE DOUBLE MEANINGS IN THE NECRONOMICONOF THE MAD ARAB ABDUL ALHAZRED WHICH THE INITIATED MIGHT READ AS THEYCHOSE ESPECIALLY THE MUCHDISCUSSED COUPLET    THAT IS NOT DEAD WHICH CAN ETERNAL LIE    AND WITH STRANGE EONS EVEN DEATH MAY DIE.LEGRASSE DEEPLY IMPRESSED AND NOT A LITTLE BEWILDERED HAD INQUIREDIN VAIN CONCERNING THE HISTORIC AFFILIATIONS OF THE CULT. CASTROAPPARENTLY HAD TOLD THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAID THAT IT WAS WHOLLYSECRET. THE AUTHORITIES AT TULANE UNIVERSITY COULD SHED NO LIGHT UPONEITHER CULT OR IMAGE AND NOW THE DETECTIVE HAD COME TO THE HIGHESTAUTHORITIES IN THE COUNTRY AND MET WITH NO MORE THAN THE GREENLAND TALEOF PROFESSOR WEBB.                                   THE FEVERISH INTEREST AROUSED AT THE MEETING BY LEGRASSES TALECORROBORATED AS IT WAS BY THE STATUETTE IS ECHOED IN THE SUBSEQUENTCORRESPONDENCE OF THOSE WHO ATTENDED ALTHOUGH SCANT MENTION OCCURS INTHE FORMAL PUBLICATION OF THE SOCIETY. CAUTION IS THE FIRST CARE OFTHOSE ACCUSTOMED TO FACE OCCASIONAL CHARLATANRY AND IMPOSTURE. LEGRASSEFOR SOME TIME LENT THE IMAGE TO PROFESSOR WEBB BUT AT THE LATTERSDEATH IT WAS RETURNED TO HIM AND REMAINS IN HIS POSSESSION WHERE IVIEWED IT NOT LONG AGO. IT IS TRULY A TERRIBLE THING AND UNMISTAKABLYAKIN TO THE DREAMSCULPTURE OF YOUNG WILCOX.THAT MY UNCLE WAS EXCITED BY THE TALE OF THE SCULPTOR I DID NOTWONDER FOR WHAT THOUGHTS MUST ARISE UPON HEARING AFTER A KNOWLEDGEOF WHAT LEGRASSE HAD LEARNED OF THE CULT OF A SENSITIVE YOUNG MANWHO HAD DREAMED NOT ONLY THE FIGURE AND EXACT HIEROGLYPHICS OF THESWAMPFOUND IMAGE AND THE GREENLAND DEVIL TABLET BUT HAD COME IN HISDREAMS UPON AT LEAST THREE OF THE PRECISE WORDS OF THE FORMULA UTTEREDALIKE BY ESKIMO DIABOLISTS AND MONGREL LOUISIANANS PROFESSOR ANGELLSINSTANT START ON AN INVESTIGATION OF THE UTMOST THOROUGHNESS WASEMINENTLY NATURAL THOUGH PRIVATELY I SUSPECTED YOUNG WILCOX OF HAVINGHEARD OF THE CULT IN SOME INDIRECT WAY AND OF HAVING INVENTED A SERIESOF DREAMS TO HEIGHTEN AND CONTINUE THE MYSTERY AT MY UNCLES EXPENSE.THE DREAMNARRATIVES AND CUTTINGS COLLECTED BY THE PROFESSOR WERE OFCOURSE STRONG CORROBORATION BUT THE RATIONALISM OF MY MIND AND THEEXTRAVAGANCE OF THE WHOLE SUBJECT LED ME TO ADOPT WHAT I THOUGHT THEMOST SENSIBLE CONCLUSIONS. SO AFTER THOROUGHLY STUDYING THE MANUSCRIPTAGAIN AND CORRELATING THE THEOSOPHICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL NOTES WITHTHE CULT NARRATIVE OF LEGRASSE I MADE A TRIP TO PROVIDENCE TO SEETHE SCULPTOR AND GIVE HIM THE REBUKE I THOUGHT PROPER FOR SO BOLDLYIMPOSING UPON A LEARNED AND AGED MAN.WILCOX STILL LIVED ALONE IN THE FLEURDELYS BUILDING IN THOMASSTREET A HIDEOUS VICTORIAN IMITATION OF SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BRETONARCHITECTURE WHICH FLAUNTS ITS STUCCOED FRONT AMIDST THE LOVELYCOLONIAL HOUSES ON THE ANCIENT HILL AND UNDER THE VERY SHADOW OF THEFINEST GEORGIAN STEEPLE IN AMERICA. I FOUND HIM AT WORK IN HIS ROOMSAND AT ONCE CONCEDED FROM THE SPECIMENS SCATTERED ABOUT THAT HIS GENIUSIS INDEED PROFOUND AND AUTHENTIC. HE WILL I BELIEVE BE HEARD FROMSOMETIME AS ONE OF THE GREAT DECADENTS FOR HE HAS CRYSTALLIZED IN CLAYAND WILL ONE DAY MIRROR IN MARBLE THOSE NIGHTMARES AND FANTASIES WHICHARTHUR MACHEN EVOKES IN PROSE AND CLARK ASHTON SMITH MAKES VISIBLE INVERSE AND IN PAINTING.DARK FRAIL AND SOMEWHAT UNKEMPT IN ASPECT HE TURNED LANGUIDLY AT MYKNOCK AND ASKED ME MY BUSINESS WITHOUT RISING. WHEN I TOLD HIM WHO IWAS HE DISPLAYED SOME INTEREST FOR MY UNCLE HAD EXCITED HIS CURIOSITYIN PROBING HIS STRANGE DREAMS YET HAD NEVER EXPLAINED THE REASON FORTHE STUDY. I DID NOT ENLARGE HIS KNOWLEDGE IN THIS REGARD BUT SOUGHTWITH SOME SUBTLETY TO DRAW HIM OUT.IN A SHORT TIME I BECAME CONVINCED OF HIS ABSOLUTE SINCERITY FOR HESPOKE OF THE DREAMS IN A MANNER NONE COULD MISTAKE. THEY AND THEIRSUBCONSCIOUS RESIDUUM HAD INFLUENCED HIS ART PROFOUNDLY AND HE SHOWEDME A MORBID STATUE WHOSE CONTOURS ALMOST MADE ME SHAKE WITH THE POTENCYOF ITS BLACK SUGGESTION. HE COULD NOT RECALL HAVING SEEN THE ORIGINALOF THIS THING EXCEPT IN HIS OWN DREAM BASRELIEF BUT THE OUTLINES HADFORMED THEMSELVES INSENSIBLY UNDER HIS HANDS. IT WAS NO DOUBT THEGIANT SHAPE HE HAD RAVED OF IN DELIRIUM. THAT HE REALLY KNEW NOTHING OFTHE HIDDEN CULT SAVE FROM WHAT MY UNCLES RELENTLESS CATECHISM HAD LETFALL HE SOON MADE CLEAR AND AGAIN I STROVE TO THINK OF SOME WAY INWHICH HE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE RECEIVED THE WEIRD IMPRESSIONS.HE TALKED OF HIS DREAMS IN A STRANGELY POETIC FASHION MAKING MESEE WITH TERRIBLE VIVIDNESS THE DAMP CYCLOPEAN CITY OF SLIMY GREENSTONEWHOSE GEOMETRY HE ODDLY SAID WAS ALL WRONGAND HEARWITH FRIGHTENED EXPECTANCY THE CEASELESS HALFMENTAL CALLING FROMUNDERGROUND CTHULHU FHTAGN CTHULHU FHTAGN.THESE WORDS HAD FORMED PART OF THAT DREAD RITUAL WHICH TOLD OF DEADCTHULHUS DREAMVIGIL IN HIS STONE VAULT AT RLYEH AND I FELT DEEPLYMOVED DESPITE MY RATIONAL BELIEFS. WILCOX I WAS SURE HAD HEARD OFTHE CULT IN SOME CASUAL WAY AND HAD SOON FORGOTTEN IT AMIDST THE MASSOF HIS EQUALLY WEIRD READING AND IMAGINING. LATER BY VIRTUE OF ITSSHEER IMPRESSIVENESS IT HAD FOUND SUBCONSCIOUS EXPRESSION IN DREAMSIN THE BASRELIEF AND IN THE TERRIBLE STATUE I NOW BEHELD SO THAT HISIMPOSTURE UPON MY UNCLE HAD BEEN A VERY INNOCENT ONE. THE YOUTH WAS OFA TYPE AT ONCE SLIGHTLY AFFECTED AND SLIGHTLY ILLMANNERED WHICH ICOULD NEVER LIKE BUT I WAS WILLING ENOUGH NOW TO ADMIT BOTH HIS GENIUSAND HIS HONESTY. I TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AMICABLY AND WISH HIM ALL THESUCCESS HIS TALENT PROMISES.THE MATTER OF THE CULT STILL REMAINED TO FASCINATE ME AND AT TIMESI HAD VISIONS OF PERSONAL FAME FROM RESEARCHES INTO ITS ORIGIN ANDCONNECTIONS. I VISITED NEW ORLEANS TALKED WITH LEGRASSE AND OTHERSOF THAT OLDTIME RAIDINGPARTY SAW THE FRIGHTFUL IMAGE AND EVENQUESTIONED SUCH OF THE MONGREL PRISONERS AS STILL SURVIVED. OLD CASTROUNFORTUNATELY HAD BEEN DEAD FOR SOME YEARS. WHAT I NOW HEARD SOGRAPHICALLY AT FIRST HAND THOUGH IT WAS REALLY NO MORE THAN A DETAILEDCONFIRMATION OF WHAT MY UNCLE HAD WRITTEN EXCITED ME AFRESH FOR IFELT SURE THAT I WAS ON THE TRACK OF A VERY REAL VERY SECRET ANDVERY ANCIENT RELIGION WHOSE DISCOVERY WOULD MAKE ME AN ANTHROPOLOGISTOF NOTE. MY ATTITUDE WAS STILL ONE OF ABSOLUTE MATERIALISM AS I WISHIT STILL WERE AND I DISCOUNTED WITH ALMOST INEXPLICABLE PERVERSITYTHE COINCIDENCE OF THE DREAM NOTES AND ODD CUTTINGS COLLECTED BYPROFESSOR ANGELL.ONE THING WHICH I BEGAN TO SUSPECT AND WHICH I NOW FEAR I KNOW ISTHAT MY UNCLES DEATH WAS FAR FROM NATURAL. HE FELL ON A NARROW HILLSTREET LEADING UP FROM AN ANCIENT WATERFRONT SWARMING WITH FOREIGNMONGRELS AFTER A CARELESS PUSH FROM A NEGRO SAILOR. I DID NOT FORGETTHE MIXED BLOOD AND MARINE PURSUITS OF THE CULTMEMBERS IN LOUISIANAAND WOULD NOT BE SURPRIZED TO LEARN OF SECRET METHODS AND POISONNEEDLES AS RUTHLESS AND AS ANCIENTLY KNOWN AS THE CRYPTIC RITES ANDBELIEFS. LEGRASSE AND HIS MEN IT IS TRUE HAVE BEEN LET ALONE BUT INNORWAY A CERTAIN SEAMAN WHO SAW THINGS IS DEAD. MIGHT NOT THE DEEPERINQUIRIES OF MY UNCLE AFTER ENCOUNTERING THE SCULPTORS DATA HAVE COMETO SINISTER EARS I THINK PROFESSOR ANGELL DIED BECAUSE HE KNEW TOOMUCH OR BECAUSE HE WAS LIKELY TO LEARN TOO MUCH. WHETHER I SHALL GO ASHE DID REMAINS TO BE SEEN FOR I HAVE LEARNED MUCH NOW.                    . THE MADNESS FROM THE SEA.IF HEAVEN EVER WISHES TO GRANT ME A BOON IT WILL BE A TOTAL EFFACINGOF THE RESULTS OF A MERE CHANCE WHICH FIXED MY EYE ON A CERTAIN STRAYPIECE OF SHELFPAPER. IT WAS NOTHING ON WHICH I WOULD NATURALLY HAVESTUMBLED IN THE COURSE OF MY DAILY ROUND FOR IT WAS AN OLD NUMBER OFAN AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL SYDNEY BULLETIN FOR APRIL  . IT HADESCAPED EVEN THE CUTTING BUREAU WHICH HAD AT THE TIME OF ITS ISSUANCEBEEN AVIDLY COLLECTING MATERIAL FOR MY UNCLES RESEARCH.I HAD LARGELY GIVEN OVER MY INQUIRIES INTO WHAT PROFESSOR ANGELL CALLEDTHE CTHULHU CULT AND WAS VISITING A LEARNED FRIEND OF PATERSONNEW JERSEY THE CURATOR OF A LOCAL MUSEUM AND A MINERALOGIST OF NOTE.EXAMINING ONE DAY THE RESERVE SPECIMENS ROUGHLY SET ON THE STORAGESHELVES IN A REAR ROOM OF THE MUSEUM MY EYE WAS CAUGHT BY AN ODDPICTURE IN ONE OF THE OLD PAPERS SPREAD BENEATH THE STONES. IT WAS THESYDNEY BULLETIN I HAVE MENTIONED FOR MY FRIEND HAS WIDE AFFILIATIONSIN ALL CONCEIVABLE FOREIGN PARTS AND THE PICTURE WAS A HALFTONE CUTOF A HIDEOUS STONE IMAGE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THAT WHICH LEGRASSE HADFOUND IN THE SWAMP.EAGERLY CLEARING THE SHEET OF ITS PRECIOUS CONTENTS I SCANNED THE ITEMIN DETAIL AND WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND IT OF ONLY MODERATE LENGTH.WHAT IT SUGGESTED HOWEVER WAS OF PORTENTOUS SIGNIFICANCE TO MYFLAGGING QUEST AND I CAREFULLY TORE IT OUT FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION. ITREAD AS FOLLOWS                     MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA    VIGILANT ARRIVES WITH HELPLESS ARMED NEW ZEALAND YACHT IN TOW.    ONE SURVIVOR AND DEAD MAN FOUND ABOARD. TALE OF DESPERATE BATTLE    AND DEATHS AT SEA. RESCUED SEAMAN REFUSES PARTICULARS OF STRANGE    EXPERIENCE. ODD IDOL FOUND IN HIS POSSESSION. INQUIRY TO FOLLOW.                                        THE MORRISON CO.S FREIGHTER VIGILANT BOUND FROM VALPARAISO    ARRIVED THIS MORNING AT ITS WHARF IN DARLING HARBOUR HAVING IN TOW    THE BATTLED AND DISABLED BUT HEAVILY ARMED STEAM YACHT ALERT OF    DUNEDIN N. Z. WHICH WAS SIGHTED APRIL TH IN S. LATITUDE      W. LONGITUDE   WITH ONE LIVING AND ONE DEAD MAN ABOARD.    THE VIGILANT LEFT VALPARAISO MARCH TH AND ON APRIL D WAS    DRIVEN CONSIDERABLY SOUTH OF HER COURSE BY EXCEPTIONALLY HEAVY    STORMS AND MONSTER WAVES. ON APRIL TH THE DERELICT WAS SIGHTED    AND THOUGH APPARENTLY DESERTED WAS FOUND UPON BOARDING TO CONTAIN    ONE SURVIVOR IN A HALFDELIRIOUS CONDITION AND ONE MAN WHO HAD    EVIDENTLY BEEN DEAD FOR MORE THAN A WEEK.    THE LIVING MAN WAS CLUTCHING A HORRIBLE STONE IDOL OF UNKNOWN    ORIGIN ABOUT A FOOT IN HEIGHT REGARDING WHOSE NATURE AUTHORITIES    AT SYDNEY UNIVERSITY THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND THE MUSEUM IN COLLEGE    STREET ALL PROFESS COMPLETE BAFFLEMENT AND WHICH THE SURVIVOR SAYS    HE FOUND IN THE CABIN OF THE YACHT IN A SMALL CARVED SHRINE OF    COMMON PATTERN.    THIS MAN AFTER RECOVERING HIS SENSES TOLD AN EXCEEDINGLY STRANGE    STORY OF PIRACY AND SLAUGHTER. HE IS GUSTAF JOHANSEN A NORWEGIAN    OF SOME INTELLIGENCE AND HAD BEEN SECOND MATE OF THE TWOMASTED    SCHOONER EMMA OF AUCKLAND WHICH SAILED FOR CALLAO FEBRUARY TH    WITH A COMPLEMENT OF ELEVEN MEN.    THE EMMA HE SAYS WAS DELAYED AND THROWN WIDELY SOUTH OF HER    COURSE BY THE GREAT STORM OF MARCH ST AND ON MARCH D IN S.    LATITUDE   W. LONGITUDE   ENCOUNTERED THE ALERT    MANNED BY A QUEER AND EVILLOOKING CREW OF KANAKAS AND HALFCASTES.    BEING ORDERED PEREMPTORILY TO TURN BACK CAPT. COLLINS REFUSED    WHEREUPON THE STRANGE CREW BEGAN TO FIRE SAVAGELY AND WITHOUT    WARNING UPON THE SCHOONER WITH A PECULIARLY HEAVY BATTERY OF BRASS    CANNON FORMING PART OF THE YACHTS EQUIPMENT.    THE EMMAS MEN SHOWED FIGHT SAYS THE SURVIVOR AND THOUGH THE    SCHOONER BEGAN TO SINK FROM SHOTS BENEATH THE WATERLINE THEY MANAGED    TO HEAVE ALONGSIDE THEIR ENEMY AND BOARD HER GRAPPLING WITH THE    SAVAGE CREW ON THE YACHTS DECK AND BEING FORCED TO KILL THEM ALL    THE NUMBER BEING SLIGHTLY SUPERIOR BECAUSE OF THEIR PARTICULARLY    ABHORRENT AND DESPERATE THOUGH RATHER CLUMSY MODE OF FIGHTING.    THREE OF THE EMMAS MEN INCLUDING CAPT. COLLINS AND FIRST MATE    GREEN WERE KILLED AND THE REMAINING EIGHT UNDER SECOND MATE    JOHANSEN PROCEEDED TO NAVIGATE THE CAPTURED YACHT GOING AHEAD IN    THEIR ORIGINAL DIRECTION TO SEE IF ANY REASON FOR THEIR ORDERING    BACK HAD EXISTED.    THE NEXT DAY IT APPEARS THEY RAISED AND LANDED ON A SMALL ISLAND    ALTHOUGH NONE IS KNOWN TO EXIST IN THAT PART OF THE OCEAN AND SIX    OF THE MEN SOMEHOW DIED ASHORE THOUGH JOHANSEN IS QUEERLY RETICENT    ABOUT THIS PART OF HIS STORY AND SPEAKS ONLY OF THEIR FALLING INTO    A ROCK CHASM.    LATER IT SEEMS HE AND ONE COMPANION BOARDED THE YACHT AND TRIED    TO MANAGE HER BUT WERE BEATEN ABOUT BY THE STORM OF APRIL ND.    FROM THAT TIME TILL HIS RESCUE ON THE TH THE MAN REMEMBERS    LITTLE AND HE DOES NOT EVEN RECALL WHEN WILLIAM BRIDEN HIS    COMPANION DIED. BRIDENS DEATH REVEALS NO APPARENT CAUSE AND WAS    PROBABLY DUE TO EXCITEMENT OR EXPOSURE.    CABLE ADVICES FROM DUNEDIN REPORT THAT THE ALERT WAS WELL KNOWN    THERE AS AN ISLAND TRADER AND BORE AN EVIL REPUTATION ALONG THE    WATERFRONT. IT WAS OWNED BY A CURIOUS GROUP OF HALFCASTES WHOSE    FREQUENT MEETINGS AND NIGHT TRIPS TO THE WOODS ATTRACTED NO LITTLE    CURIOSITY AND IT HAD SET SAIL IN GREAT HASTE JUST AFTER THE STORM    AND EARTH TREMORS OF MARCH ST.    OUR AUCKLAND CORRESPONDENT GIVES THE EMMA AND HER CREW AN    EXCELLENT REPUTATION AND JOHANSEN IS DESCRIBED AS A SOBER AND    WORTHY MAN.    THE ADMIRALTY WILL INSTITUTE AN INQUIRY ON THE WHOLE MATTER    BEGINNING TOMORROW AT WHICH EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO INDUCE    JOHANSEN TO SPEAK MORE FREELY THAN HE HAS DONE HITHERTO.                                   THIS WAS ALL TOGETHER WITH THE PICTURE OF THE HELLISH IMAGE BUT WHATA TRAIN OF IDEAS IT STARTED IN MY MIND HERE WERE NEW TREASURIES OFDATA ON THE CTHULHU CULT AND EVIDENCE THAT IT HAD STRANGE INTERESTSAT SEA AS WELL AS ON LAND. WHAT MOTIVE PROMPTED THE HYBRID CREW TOORDER BACK THE EMMA AS THEY SAILED ABOUT WITH THEIR HIDEOUS IDOLWHAT WAS THE UNKNOWN ISLAND ON WHICH SIX OF THE EMMAS CREW HADDIED AND ABOUT WHICH THE MATE JOHANSEN WAS SO SECRETIVE WHAT HAD THEVICEADMIRALTYS INVESTIGATION BROUGHT OUT AND WHAT WAS KNOWN OF THENOXIOUS CULT IN DUNEDIN AND MOST MARVELOUS OF ALL WHAT DEEP AND MORETHAN NATURAL LINKAGE OF DATES WAS THIS WHICH GAVE A MALIGN AND NOWUNDENIABLE SIGNIFICANCE TO THE VARIOUS TURNS OF EVENTS SO CAREFULLYNOTED BY MY UNCLEMARCH STOUR FEBRUARY TH ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL DATELINETHE EARTHQUAKE AND STORM HAD COME. FROM DUNEDIN THE ALERT ANDHER NOISOME CREW HAD DARTED EAGERLY FORTH AS IF IMPERIOUSLY SUMMONEDAND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EARTH POETS AND ARTISTS HAD BEGUN TODREAM OF A STRANGE DANK CYCLOPEAN CITY WHILST A YOUNG SCULPTOR HADMOLDED IN HIS SLEEP THE FORM OF THE DREADED CTHULHU. MARCH RD THECREW OF THE EMMA LANDED ON AN UNKNOWN ISLAND AND LEFT SIX MEN DEADAND ON THAT DATE THE DREAMS OF SENSITIVE MEN ASSUMED A HEIGHTENEDVIVIDNESS AND DARKENED WITH DREAD OF A GIANT MONSTERS MALIGN PURSUITWHILST AN ARCHITECT HAD GONE MAD AND A SCULPTOR HAD LAPSED SUDDENLYINTO DELIRIUM AND WHAT OF THIS STORM OF APRIL NDTHE DATE ON WHICHALL DREAMS OF THE DANK CITY CEASED AND WILCOX EMERGED UNHARMED FROMTHE BONDAGE OF STRANGE FEVER WHAT OF ALL THISAND OF THOSE HINTS OFOLD CASTRO ABOUT THE SUNKEN STARBORN OLD ONES AND THEIR COMING REIGNTHEIR FAITHFUL CULT AND THEIR MASTERY OF DREAMS WAS I TOTTERING ONTHE BRINK OF COSMIC HORRORS BEYOND MANS POWER TO BEAR IF SO THEYMUST BE HORRORS OF THE MIND ALONE FOR IN SOME WAY THE SECOND OF APRILHAD PUT A STOP TO WHATEVER MONSTROUS MENACE HAD BEGUN ITS SIEGE OFMANKINDS SOUL.                                   THAT EVENING AFTER A DAY OF HURRIED CABLING AND ARRANGING I BADE MYHOST ADIEU AND TOOK A TRAIN FOR SAN FRANCISCO. IN LESS THAN A MONTHI WAS IN DUNEDIN WHERE HOWEVER I FOUND THAT LITTLE WAS KNOWN OFTHE STRANGE CULTMEMBERS WHO HAD LINGERED IN THE OLD SEA TAVERNS.WATERFRONT SCUM WAS FAR TOO COMMON FOR SPECIAL MENTION THOUGH THEREWAS VAGUE TALK ABOUT ONE INLAND TRIP THESE MONGRELS HAD MADE DURINGWHICH FAINT DRUMMING AND RED FLAME WERE NOTED ON THE DISTANT HILLS.IN AUCKLAND I LEARNED THAT JOHANSEN HAD RETURNED WITH YELLOW HAIRTURNED WHITE AFTER A PERFUNCTORY AND INCONCLUSIVE QUESTIONING ATSYDNEY AND HAD THEREAFTER SOLD HIS COTTAGE IN WEST STREET AND SAILEDWITH HIS WIFE TO HIS OLD HOME IN OSLO. OF HIS STIRRING EXPERIENCEHE WOULD TELL HIS FRIENDS NO MORE THAN HE HAD TOLD THE ADMIRALTYOFFICIALS AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO GIVE ME HIS OSLO ADDRESS.AFTER THAT I WENT TO SYDNEY AND TALKED PROFITLESSLY WITH SEAMEN ANDMEMBERS OF THE VICEADMIRALTY COURT. I SAW THE ALERT NOW SOLD ANDIN COMMERCIAL USE AT CIRCULAR QUAY IN SYDNEY COVE BUT GAINED NOTHINGFROM ITS NONCOMMITTAL BULK. THE CROUCHING IMAGE WITH ITS CUTTLEFISHHEAD DRAGON BODY SCALY WINGS AND HIEROGLYPHED PEDESTAL WASPRESERVED IN THE MUSEUM AT HYDE PARK AND I STUDIED IT LONG AND WELLFINDING IT A THING OF BALEFULLY EXQUISITE WORKMANSHIP AND WITH THESAME UTTER MYSTERY TERRIBLE ANTIQUITY AND UNEARTHLY STRANGENESS OFMATERIAL WHICH I HAD NOTED IN LEGRASSES SMALLER SPECIMEN. GEOLOGISTSTHE CURATOR TOLD ME HAD FOUND IT A MONSTROUS PUZZLE FOR THEY VOWEDTHAT THE WORLD HELD NO ROCK LIKE IT. THEN I THOUGHT WITH A SHUDDER OFWHAT OLD CASTRO HAD TOLD LEGRASSE ABOUT THE PRIMAL GREAT ONES THEYHAD COME FROM THE STARS AND HAD BROUGHT THEIR IMAGES WITH THEM.SHAKEN WITH SUCH A MENTAL REVOLUTION AS I HAD NEVER BEFORE KNOWN INOW RESOLVED TO VISIT MATE JOHANSEN IN OSLO. SAILING FOR LONDON IREEMBARKED AT ONCE FOR THE NORWEGIAN CAPITAL AND ONE AUTUMN DAYLANDED AT THE TRIM WHARVES IN THE SHADOW OF THE EGEBERG.JOHANSENS ADDRESS I DISCOVERED LAY IN THE OLD TOWN OF KING HAROLDHAARDRADA WHICH KEPT ALIVE THE NAME OF OSLO DURING ALL THE CENTURIESTHAT THE GREATER CITY MASQUERADED AS CHRISTIANIA. I MADE THE BRIEFTRIP BY TAXICAB AND KNOCKED WITH PALPITANT HEART AT THE DOOR OF A NEATAND ANCIENT BUILDING WITH PLASTERED FRONT. A SADFACED WOMAN IN BLACKANSWERED MY SUMMONS AND I WAS STUNG WITH DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN SHE TOLDME IN HALTING ENGLISH THAT GUSTAF JOHANSEN WAS NO MORE.HE HAD NOT LONG SURVIVED HIS RETURN SAID HIS WIFE FOR THE DOINGS ATSEA IN  HAD BROKEN HIM. HE HAD TOLD HER NO MORE THAN HE HAD TOLDTHE PUBLIC BUT HAD LEFT A LONG MANUSCRIPTOF TECHNICAL MATTERS ASHE SAIDWRITTEN IN ENGLISH EVIDENTLY IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD HER FROMTHE PERIL OF CASUAL PERUSAL. DURING A WALK THROUGH A NARROW LANE NEARTHE GOTHENBURG DOCK A BUNDLE OF PAPERS FALLING FROM AN ATTIC WINDOWHAD KNOCKED HIM DOWN. TWO LASCAR SAILORS AT ONCE HELPED HIM TO HISFEET BUT BEFORE THE AMBULANCE COULD REACH HIM HE WAS DEAD. PHYSICIANSFOUND NO ADEQUATE CAUSE FOR THE END AND LAID IT TO HEART TROUBLE AND AWEAKENED CONSTITUTION.I NOW FELT GNAWING AT MY VITALS THAT DARK TERROR WHICH WILL NEVER LEAVEME TILL I TOO AM AT REST ACCIDENTALLY OR OTHERWISE. PERSUADING THEWIDOW THAT MY CONNECTION WITH HER HUSBANDS TECHNICAL MATTERS WASSUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE ME TO HIS MANUSCRIPT I BORE THE DOCUMENT AWAYAND BEGAN TO READ IT ON THE LONDON BOAT.IT WAS A SIMPLE RAMBLING THINGA NAIVE SAILORS EFFORT AT APOSTFACTO DIARYAND STROVE TO RECALL DAY BY DAY THAT LAST AWFULVOYAGE. I CAN NOT ATTEMPT TO TRANSCRIBE IT VERBATIM IN ALL ITSCLOUDINESS AND REDUNDANCE BUT I WILL TELL ITS GIST ENOUGH TO SHOW WHYTHE SOUND OF THE WATER AGAINST THE VESSELS SIDES BECAME SO UNENDURABLETO ME THAT I STOPPED MY EARS WITH COTTON.JOHANSEN THANK GOD DID NOT KNOW QUITE ALL EVEN THOUGH HE SAW THECITY AND THE THING BUT I SHALL NEVER SLEEP CALMLY AGAIN WHEN I THINKOF THE HORRORS THAT LURK CEASELESSLY BEHIND LIFE IN TIME AND IN SPACEAND OF THOSE UNHALLOWED BLASPHEMIES FROM ELDER STARS WHICH DREAMBENEATH THE SEA KNOWN AND FAVORED BY A NIGHTMARE CULT READY AND EAGERTO LOOSE THEM ON THE WORLD WHENEVER ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE SHALL HEAVETHEIR MONSTROUS STONE CITY AGAIN TO THE SUN AND AIR.                                   JOHANSENS VOYAGE HAD BEGUN JUST AS HE TOLD IT TO THE VICEADMIRALTY.THE EMMA IN BALLAST HAD CLEARED AUCKLAND ON FEBRUARY TH AND HADFELT THE FULL FORCE OF THAT EARTHQUAKEBORN TEMPEST WHICH MUST HAVEHEAVED UP FROM THE SEABOTTOM THE HORRORS THAT FILLED MENS DREAMS.ONCE MORE UNDER CONTROL THE SHIP WAS MAKING GOOD PROGRESS WHEN HELDUP BY THE ALERT ON MARCH ND AND I COULD FEEL THE MATES REGRET ASHE WROTE OF HER BOMBARDMENT AND SINKING. OF THE SWARTHY CULTFIENDSON THE ALERT HE SPEAKS WITH SIGNIFICANT HORROR. THERE WAS SOMEPECULIARLY ABOMINABLE QUALITY ABOUT THEM WHICH MADE THEIR DESTRUCTIONSEEM ALMOST A DUTY AND JOHANSEN SHOWS INGENUOUS WONDER AT THE CHARGEOF RUTHLESSNESS BROUGHT AGAINST HIS PARTY DURING THE PROCEEDINGS OF THECOURT OF INQUIRY. THEN DRIVEN AHEAD BY CURIOSITY IN THEIR CAPTUREDYACHT UNDER JOHANSENS COMMAND THE MEN SIGHT A GREAT STONE PILLARSTICKING OUT OF THE SEA AND IN S. LATITUDE   W. LONGITUDE  COME UPON A COASTLINE OF MINGLED MUD OOZE AND WEEDY CYCLOPEANMASONRY WHICH CAN BE NOTHING LESS THAN THE TANGIBLE SUBSTANCE OFEARTHS SUPREME TERRORTHE NIGHTMARE CORPSECITY OF RLYEH THATWAS BUILT IN MEASURELESS EONS BEHIND HISTORY BY THE VAST LOATHSOMESHAPES THAT SEEPED DOWN FROM THE DARK STARS. THERE LAY GREAT CTHULHUAND HIS HORDES HIDDEN IN GREEN SLIMY VAULTS AND SENDING OUT AT LASTAFTER CYCLES INCALCULABLE THE THOUGHTS THAT SPREAD FEAR TO THE DREAMSOF THE SENSITIVE AND CALLED IMPERIOUSLY TO THE FAITHFUL TO COME ON APILGRIMAGE OF LIBERATION AND RESTORATION. ALL THIS JOHANSEN DID NOTSUSPECT BUT GOD KNOWS HE SOON SAW ENOUGHI SUPPOSE THAT ONLY A SINGLE MOUNTAINTOP THE HIDEOUS MONOLITHCROWNEDCITADEL WHEREON GREAT CTHULHU WAS BURIED ACTUALLY EMERGED FROM THEWATERS. WHEN I THINK OF THE EXTENT OF ALL THAT MAY BE BROODING DOWNTHERE I ALMOST WISH TO KILL MYSELF FORTHWITH. JOHANSEN AND HIS MEN WEREAWED BY THE COSMIC MAJESTY OF THIS DRIPPING BABYLON OF ELDER DEMONSAND MUST HAVE GUESSED WITHOUT GUIDANCE THAT IT WAS NOTHING OF THIS OROF ANY SANE PLANET. AWE AT THE UNBELIEVABLE SIZE OF THE GREENISH STONEBLOCKS AT THE DIZZYING HEIGHT OF THE GREAT CARVEN MONOLITH AND AT THESTUPEFYING IDENTITY OF THE COLOSSAL STATUES AND BASRELIEFS WITH THEQUEER IMAGE FOUND IN THE SHRINE ON THE ALERT IS POIGNANTLY VISIBLEIN EVERY LINE OF THE MATES FRIGHTENED DESCRIPTION.WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT FUTURISM IS LIKE JOHANSEN ACHIEVED SOMETHINGVERY CLOSE TO IT WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE CITY FOR INSTEAD OF DESCRIBINGANY DEFINITE STRUCTURE OR BUILDING HE DWELLS ONLY ON THE BROADIMPRESSIONS OF VAST ANGLES AND STONE SURFACESSURFACES TOO GREAT TOBELONG TO ANYTHING RIGHT OR PROPER FOR THIS EARTH AND IMPIOUS WITHHORRIBLE IMAGES AND HIEROGLYPHS. I MENTION HIS TALK ABOUT ANGLESBECAUSE IT SUGGESTS SOMETHING WILCOX HAD TOLD ME OF HIS AWFUL DREAMS.HE HAD SAID THAT THE GEOMETRY OF THE DREAMPLACE HE SAW WAS ABNORMALNONEUCLIDEAN AND LOATHSOMELY REDOLENT OF SPHERES AND DIMENSIONS APARTFROM OURS. NOW AN UNLETTERED SEAMAN FELT THE SAME THING WHILST GAZINGAT THE TERRIBLE REALITY.JOHANSEN AND HIS MEN LANDED AT A SLOPING MUDBANK ON THIS MONSTROUSACROPOLIS AND CLAMBERED SLIPPERILY UP OVER TITAN OOZY BLOCKS WHICHCOULD HAVE BEEN NO MORTAL STAIRCASE. THE VERY SUN OF HEAVEN SEEMEDDISTORTED WHEN VIEWED THROUGH THE POLARIZING MIASMA WELLING OUT FROMTHIS SEASOAKED PERVERSION AND TWISTED MENACE AND SUSPENSE LURKEDLEERINGLY IN THOSE CRAZILY ELUSIVE ANGLES OF CARVEN ROCK WHERE A SECONDGLANCE SHOWED CONCAVITY AFTER THE FIRST SHOWED CONVEXITY.SOMETHING VERY LIKE FRIGHT HAD COME OVER ALL THE EXPLORERS BEFOREANYTHING MORE DEFINITE THAN ROCK AND OOZE AND WEED WAS SEEN. EACHWOULD HAVE FLED HAD HE NOT FEARED THE SCORN OF THE OTHERS AND IT WASONLY HALFHEARTEDLY THAT THEY SEARCHEDVAINLY AS IT PROVEDFOR SOMEPORTABLE SOUVENIR TO BEAR AWAY.IT WAS RODRIGUEZ THE PORTUGUESE WHO CLIMBED UP THE FOOT OF THE MONOLITHAND SHOUTED OF WHAT HE HAD FOUND. THE REST FOLLOWED HIM AND LOOKEDCURIOUSLY AT THE IMMENSE CARVED DOOR WITH THE NOW FAMILIAR SQUIDDRAGONBASRELIEF. IT WAS JOHANSEN SAID LIKE A GREAT BARNDOOR AND THEY ALLFELT THAT IT WAS A DOOR BECAUSE OF THE ORNATE LINTEL THRESHOLD ANDJAMBS AROUND IT THOUGH THEY COULD NOT DECIDE WHETHER IT LAY FLAT LIKEA TRAPDOOR OR SLANTWISE LIKE AN OUTSIDE CELLARDOOR. AS WILCOX WOULDHAVE SAID THE GEOMETRY OF THE PLACE WAS ALL WRONG. ONE COULD NOT BESURE THAT THE SEA AND THE GROUND WERE HORIZONTAL HENCE THE RELATIVEPOSITION OF EVERYTHING ELSE SEEMED FANTASMALLY VARIABLE.BRIDEN PUSHED AT THE STONE IN SEVERAL PLACES WITHOUT RESULT. THENDONOVAN FELT OVER IT DELICATELY AROUND THE EDGE PRESSING EACH POINTSEPARATELY AS HE WENT. HE CLIMBED INTERMINABLY ALONG THE GROTESQUESTONE MOLDINGTHAT IS ONE WOULD CALL IT CLIMBING IF THE THING WAS NOTAFTER ALL HORIZONTALAND THE MEN WONDERED HOW ANY DOOR IN THE UNIVERSECOULD BE SO VAST. THEN VERY SOFTLY AND SLOWLY THE ACREGREAT PANELBEGAN TO GIVE INWARD AT THE TOP AND THEY SAW THAT IT WAS BALANCED.DONOVAN SLID OR SOMEHOW PROPELLED HIMSELF DOWN OR ALONG THE JAMB ANDREJOINED HIS FELLOWS AND EVERYONE WATCHED THE QUEER RECESSION OF THEMONSTROUSLY CARVEN PORTAL. IN THIS FANTASY OF PRISMATIC DISTORTION ITMOVED ANOMALOUSLY IN A DIAGONAL WAY SO THAT ALL THE RULES OF MATTERAND PERSPECTIVE SEEMED UPSET.THE APERTURE WAS BLACK WITH A DARKNESS ALMOST MATERIAL. THATTENEBROUSNESS WAS INDEED A POSITIVE QUALITY FOR IT OBSCURED SUCHPARTS OF THE INNER WALLS AS OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN REVEALED AND ACTUALLYBURST FORTH LIKE SMOKE FROM ITS EONLONG IMPRISONMENT VISIBLYDARKENING THE SUN AS IT SLUNK AWAY INTO THE SHRUNKEN AND GIBBOUS SKYON FLAPPING MEMBRANOUS WINGS. THE ODOR ARISING FROM THE NEWLY OPENEDDEPTHS WAS INTOLERABLE AND AT LENGTH THE QUICKEARED HAWKINS THOUGHTHE HEARD A NASTY SLOPPING SOUND DOWN THERE. EVERYONE LISTENED ANDEVERYONE WAS LISTENING STILL WHEN IT LUMBERED SLOBBERINGLY INTO SIGHTAND GROPINGLY SQUEEZED ITS GELATINOUS GREEN IMMENSITY THROUGH THE BLACKDOORWAY INTO THE TAINTED OUTSIDE AIR OF THAT POISON CITY OF MADNESS.POOR JOHANSENS HANDWRITING ALMOST GAVE OUT WHEN HE WROTE OF THIS. OFTHE SIX MEN WHO NEVER REACHED THE SHIP HE THINKS TWO PERISHED OF PUREFRIGHT IN THAT ACCURSED INSTANT. THE THING CAN NOT BE DESCRIBEDTHEREIS NO LANGUAGE FOR SUCH ABYSMS OF SHRIEKING AND IMMEMORIAL LUNACYSUCH ELDRITCH CONTRADICTIONS OF ALL MATTER FORCE AND COSMIC ORDER.A MOUNTAIN WALKED OR STUMBLED. GOD WHAT WONDER THAT ACROSS THE EARTHA GREAT ARCHITECT WENT MAD AND POOR WILCOX RAVED WITH FEVER IN THATTELEPATHIC INSTANT THE THING OF THE IDOLS THE GREEN STICKY SPAWN OFTHE STARS HAD AWAKED TO CLAIM HIS OWN. THE STARS WERE RIGHT AGAIN ANDWHAT AN AGEOLD CULT HAD FAILED TO DO BY DESIGN A BAND OF INNOCENTSAILORS HAD DONE BY ACCIDENT. AFTER VIGINTILLIONS OF YEARS GREATCTHULHU WAS LOOSE AGAIN AND RAVENING FOR DELIGHT.THREE MEN WERE SWEPT UP BY THE FLABBY CLAWS BEFORE ANYBODY TURNED. GODREST THEM IF THERE BE ANY REST IN THE UNIVERSE. THEY WERE DONOVANGUERRERA AND ANGSTROM. PARKER SLIPPED AS THE OTHER THREE WERE PLUNGINGFRENZIEDLY OVER ENDLESS VISTAS OF GREENCRUSTED ROCK TO THE BOATAND JOHANSEN SWEARS HE WAS SWALLOWED UP BY AN ANGLE OF MASONRY WHICHSHOULDNT HAVE BEEN THERE AN ANGLE WHICH WAS ACUTE BUT BEHAVED ASIF IT WERE OBTUSE. SO ONLY BRIDEN AND JOHANSEN REACHED THE BOAT ANDPULLED DESPERATELY FOR THE ALERT AS THE MOUNTAINOUS MONSTROSITYFLOPPED DOWN THE SLIMY STONES AND HESITATED FLOUNDERING AT THE EDGE OFTHE WATER.STEAM HAD NOT BEEN SUFFERED TO GO DOWN ENTIRELY DESPITE THE DEPARTUREOF ALL HANDS FOR THE SHORE AND IT WAS THE WORK OF ONLY A FEW MOMENTSOF FEVERISH RUSHING UP AND DOWN BETWEEN WHEELS AND ENGINES TO GETTHE ALERT UNDER WAY. SLOWLY AMIDST THE DISTORTED HORRORS OF THATINDESCRIBABLE SCENE SHE BEGAN TO CHURN THE LETHAL WATERS WHILST ONTHE MASONRY OF THAT CHARNEL SHORE THAT WAS NOT OF EARTH THE TITAN THINGFROM THE STARS SLAVERED AND GIBBERED LIKE POLYPHEME CURSING THE FLEEINGSHIP OF ODYSSEUS. THEN BOLDER THAN THE STORIED CYCLOPS GREAT CTHULHUSLID GREASILY INTO THE WATER AND BEGAN TO PURSUE WITH VAST WAVERAISINGSTROKES OF COSMIC POTENCY. BRIDEN LOOKED BACK AND WENT MAD LAUGHINGSHRILLY AS HE KEPT ON LAUGHING AT INTERVALS TILL DEATH FOUND HIM ONENIGHT IN THE CABIN WHILST JOHANSEN WAS WANDERING DELIRIOUSLY.BUT JOHANSEN HAD NOT GIVEN OUT YET. KNOWING THAT THE THING COULDSURELY OVERTAKE THE ALERT UNTIL STEAM WAS FULLY UP HE RESOLVEDON A DESPERATE CHANCE AND SETTING THE ENGINE FOR FULL SPEED RANLIGHTNINGLIKE ON DECK AND REVERSED THE WHEEL. THERE WAS A MIGHTYEDDYING AND FOAMING IN THE NOISOME BRINE AND AS THE STEAM MOUNTEDHIGHER AND HIGHER THE BRAVE NORWEGIAN DROVE HIS VESSEL HEAD ON AGAINSTTHE PURSUING JELLY WHICH ROSE ABOVE THE UNCLEAN FROTH LIKE THE STERNOF A DEMON GALLEON. THE AWFUL SQUIDHEAD WITH WRITHING FEELERS CAMENEARLY UP TO THE BOWSPRIT OF THE STURDY YACHT BUT JOHANSEN DROVE ONRELENTLESSLY.THERE WAS A BURSTING AS OF AN EXPLODING BLADDER A SLUSHY NASTINESSAS OF A CLOVEN SUNFISH A STENCH AS OF A THOUSAND OPENED GRAVES ANDA SOUND THAT THE CHRONICLER WOULD NOT PUT ON PAPER. FOR AN INSTANTTHE SHIP WAS BEFOULED BY AN ACRID AND BLINDING GREEN CLOUD AND THENTHERE WAS ONLY A VENOMOUS SEETHING ASTERN WHEREGOD IN HEAVENTHESCATTERED PLASTICITY OF THAT NAMELESS SKYSPAWN WAS NEBULOUSLYRECOMBINING IN ITS HATEFUL ORIGINAL FORM WHILST ITS DISTANCE WIDENEDEVERY SECOND AS THE ALERT GAINED IMPETUS FROM ITS MOUNTING STEAM.                                   THAT WAS ALL. AFTER THAT JOHANSEN ONLY BROODED OVER THE IDOL IN THECABIN AND ATTENDED TO A FEW MATTERS OF FOOD FOR HIMSELF AND THELAUGHING MANIAC BY HIS SIDE. HE DID NOT TRY TO NAVIGATE AFTER THE FIRSTBOLD FLIGHT FOR THE REACTION HAD TAKEN SOMETHING OUT OF HIS SOUL. THENCAME THE STORM OF APRIL ND AND A GATHERING OF THE CLOUDS ABOUT HISCONSCIOUSNESS. THERE IS A SENSE OF SPECTRAL WHIRLING THROUGH LIQUIDGULFS OF INFINITY OF DIZZYING RIDES THROUGH REELING UNIVERSES ON ACOMETS TAIL AND OF HYSTERICAL PLUNGES FROM THE PIT TO THE MOON ANDFROM THE MOON BACK AGAIN TO THE PIT ALL LIVENED BY A CACHINNATINGCHORUS OF THE DISTORTED HILARIOUS ELDER GODS AND THE GREEN BATWINGEDMOCKING IMPS OF TARTARUS.OUT OF THAT DREAM CAME RESCUETHE VIGILANT THE VICEADMIRALTYCOURT THE STREETS OF DUNEDIN AND THE LONG VOYAGE BACK HOME TO THEOLD HOUSE BY THE EGEBERG. HE COULD NOT TELLTHEY WOULD THINK HIM MAD.HE WOULD WRITE OF WHAT HE KNEW BEFORE DEATH CAME BUT HIS WIFE MUST NOTGUESS. DEATH WOULD BE A BOON IF ONLY IT COULD BLOT OUT THE MEMORIES.THAT WAS THE DOCUMENT I READ AND NOW I HAVE PLACED IT IN THE TIN BOXBESIDE THE BASRELIEF AND THE PAPERS OF PROFESSOR ANGELL. WITH IT SHALLGO THIS RECORD OF MINETHIS TEST OF MY OWN SANITY WHEREIN IS PIECEDTOGETHER THAT WHICH I HOPE MAY NEVER BE PIECED TOGETHER AGAIN. I HAVELOOKED UPON ALL THAT THE UNIVERSE HAS TO HOLD OF HORROR AND EVEN THESKIES OF SPRING AND THE FLOWERS OF SUMMER MUST EVER AFTERWARD BE POISONTO ME. BUT I DO NOT THINK MY LIFE WILL BE LONG. AS MY UNCLE WENT ASPOOR JOHANSEN WENT SO I SHALL GO. I KNOW TOO MUCH AND THE CULT STILLLIVES.CTHULHU STILL LIVES TOO I SUPPOSE AGAIN IN THAT CHASM OF STONEWHICH HAS SHIELDED HIM SINCE THE SUN WAS YOUNG. HIS ACCURSED CITY ISSUNKEN ONCE MORE FOR THE VIGILANT SAILED OVER THE SPOT AFTER THEAPRIL STORM BUT HIS MINISTERS ON EARTH STILL BELLOW AND PRANCE ANDSLAY AROUND IDOLCAPPED MONOLITHS IN LONELY PLACES. HE MUST HAVE BEENTRAPPED BY THE SINKING WHILST WITHIN HIS BLACK ABYSS OR ELSE THE WORLDWOULD BY NOW BE SCREAMING WITH FRIGHT AND FRENZY. WHO KNOWS THE ENDWHAT HAS RISEN MAY SINK AND WHAT HAS SUNK MAY RISE. LOATHSOMENESSWAITS AND DREAMS IN THE DEEP AND DECAY SPREADS OVER THE TOTTERINGCITIES OF MEN. A TIME WILL COMEBUT I MUST NOT AND CAN NOT THINK LETME PRAY THAT IF I DO NOT SURVIVE THIS MANUSCRIPT MY EXECUTORS MAY PUTCAUTION BEFORE AUDACITY AND SEE THAT IT MEETS NO OTHER EYE.\n",

VOILA TOUTE LA DIFFRENCE.TOWARD THE END OF THE YEAR  THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES HADPRACTICALLY COMPLETED THE PROGRAMME ADOPTED DURING THE LAST MONTHS OFPRESIDENT WINTHROPS ADMINISTRATION. THE COUNTRY WAS APPARENTLY TRANQUIL.EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW THE TARIFF AND LABOUR QUESTIONS WERE SETTLED. THE WARWITH GERMANY INCIDENT ON THAT COUNTRYS SEIZURE OF THE SAMOAN ISLANDSHAD LEFT NO VISIBLE SCARS UPON THE REPUBLIC AND THE TEMPORARY OCCUPATIONOF NORFOLK BY THE INVADING ARMY HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN IN THE JOY OVERREPEATED NAVAL VICTORIES AND THE SUBSEQUENT RIDICULOUS PLIGHT OF GENERALVON GARTENLAUBES FORCES IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. THE CUBAN ANDHAWAIIAN INVESTMENTS HAD PAID ONE HUNDRED PER CENT AND THE TERRITORY OFSAMOA WAS WELL WORTH ITS COST AS A COALING STATION. THE COUNTRY WAS IN ASUPERB STATE OF DEFENCE. EVERY COAST CITY HAD BEEN WELL SUPPLIED WITH LANDFORTIFICATIONS THE ARMY UNDER THE PARENTAL EYE OF THE GENERAL STAFFORGANIZED ACCORDING TO THE PRUSSIAN SYSTEM HAD BEEN INCREASED TO MEN WITH A TERRITORIAL RESERVE OF A MILLION AND SIX MAGNIFICENTSQUADRONS OF CRUISERS AND BATTLESHIPS PATROLLED THE SIX STATIONS OF THENAVIGABLE SEAS LEAVING A STEAM RESERVE AMPLY FITTED TO CONTROL HOMEWATERS. THE GENTLEMEN FROM THE WEST HAD AT LAST BEEN CONSTRAINED TOACKNOWLEDGE THAT A COLLEGE FOR THE TRAINING OF DIPLOMATS WAS AS NECESSARYAS LAW SCHOOLS ARE FOR THE TRAINING OF BARRISTERS CONSEQUENTLY WE WERE NOLONGER REPRESENTED ABROAD BY INCOMPETENT PATRIOTS. THE NATION WASPROSPEROUS CHICAGO FOR A MOMENT PARALYZED AFTER A SECOND GREAT FIRE HADRISEN FROM ITS RUINS WHITE AND IMPERIAL AND MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE WHITECITY WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT FOR ITS PLAYTHING IN . EVERYWHERE GOODARCHITECTURE WAS REPLACING BAD AND EVEN IN NEW YORK A SUDDEN CRAVING FORDECENCY HAD SWEPT AWAY A GREAT PORTION OF THE EXISTING HORRORS. STREETSHAD BEEN WIDENED PROPERLY PAVED AND LIGHTED TREES HAD BEEN PLANTEDSQUARES LAID OUT ELEVATED STRUCTURES DEMOLISHED AND UNDERGROUND ROADSBUILT TO REPLACE THEM. THE NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS AND BARRACKS WERE FINEBITS OF ARCHITECTURE AND THE LONG SYSTEM OF STONE QUAYS WHICH COMPLETELYSURROUNDED THE ISLAND HAD BEEN TURNED INTO PARKS WHICH PROVED A GODSENDTO THE POPULATION. THE SUBSIDIZING OF THE STATE THEATRE AND STATE OPERABROUGHT ITS OWN REWARD. THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL ACADEMY OF DESIGN WASMUCH LIKE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS OF THE SAME KIND. NOBODY ENVIED THESECRETARY OF FINE ARTS EITHER HIS CABINET POSITION OR HIS PORTFOLIO. THESECRETARY OF FORESTRY AND GAME PRESERVATION HAD A MUCH EASIER TIME THANKSTO THE NEW SYSTEM OF NATIONAL MOUNTED POLICE. WE HAD PROFITED WELL BY THELATEST TREATIES WITH FRANCE AND ENGLAND THE EXCLUSION OF FOREIGNBORNJEWS AS A MEASURE OF SELFPRESERVATION THE SETTLEMENT OF THE NEWINDEPENDENT NEGRO STATE OF SUANEE THE CHECKING OF IMMIGRATION THE NEWLAWS CONCERNING NATURALIZATION AND THE GRADUAL CENTRALIZATION OF POWER INTHE EXECUTIVE ALL CONTRIBUTED TO NATIONAL CALM AND PROSPERITY. WHEN THEGOVERNMENT SOLVED THE INDIAN PROBLEM AND SQUADRONS OF INDIAN CAVALRYSCOUTS IN NATIVE COSTUME WERE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE PITIABLE ORGANIZATIONSTACKED ON TO THE TAIL OF SKELETONIZED REGIMENTS BY A FORMER SECRETARY OFWAR THE NATION DREW A LONG SIGH OF RELIEF. WHEN AFTER THE COLOSSALCONGRESS OF RELIGIONS BIGOTRY AND INTOLERANCE WERE LAID IN THEIR GRAVESAND KINDNESS AND CHARITY BEGAN TO DRAW WARRING SECTS TOGETHER MANYTHOUGHT THE MILLENNIUM HAD ARRIVED AT LEAST IN THE NEW WORLD WHICH AFTERALL IS A WORLD BY ITSELF.BUT SELFPRESERVATION IS THE FIRST LAW AND THE UNITED STATES HAD TO LOOKON IN HELPLESS SORROW AS GERMANY ITALY SPAIN AND BELGIUM WRITHED IN THETHROES OF ANARCHY WHILE RUSSIA WATCHING FROM THE CAUCASUS STOOPED ANDBOUND THEM ONE BY ONE.IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK THE SUMMER OF  WAS SIGNALIZED BY THEDISMANTLING OF THE ELEVATED RAILROADS. THE SUMMER OF  WILL LIVE INTHE MEMORIES OF NEW YORK PEOPLE FOR MANY A CYCLE THE DODGE STATUE WASREMOVED IN THAT YEAR. IN THE FOLLOWING WINTER BEGAN THAT AGITATION FORTHE REPEAL OF THE LAWS PROHIBITING SUICIDE WHICH BORE ITS FINAL FRUIT INTHE MONTH OF APRIL  WHEN THE FIRST GOVERNMENT LETHAL CHAMBER WASOPENED ON WASHINGTON SQUARE.I HAD WALKED DOWN THAT DAY FROM DR. ARCHERS HOUSE ON MADISON AVENUEWHERE I HAD BEEN AS A MERE FORMALITY. EVER SINCE THAT FALL FROM MY HORSEFOUR YEARS BEFORE I HAD BEEN TROUBLED AT TIMES WITH PAINS IN THE BACK OFMY HEAD AND NECK BUT NOW FOR MONTHS THEY HAD BEEN ABSENT AND THE DOCTORSENT ME AWAY THAT DAY SAYING THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE CURED IN ME. ITWAS HARDLY WORTH HIS FEE TO BE TOLD THAT I KNEW IT MYSELF. STILL I DIDNOT GRUDGE HIM THE MONEY. WHAT I MINDED WAS THE MISTAKE WHICH HE MADE ATFIRST. WHEN THEY PICKED ME UP FROM THE PAVEMENT WHERE I LAY UNCONSCIOUSAND SOMEBODY HAD MERCIFULLY SENT A BULLET THROUGH MY HORSES HEAD I WASCARRIED TO DR. ARCHER AND HE PRONOUNCING MY BRAIN AFFECTED PLACED MEIN HIS PRIVATE ASYLUM WHERE I WAS OBLIGED TO ENDURE TREATMENT FORINSANITY. AT LAST HE DECIDED THAT I WAS WELL AND I KNOWING THAT MY MINDHAD ALWAYS BEEN AS SOUND AS HIS IF NOT SOUNDER PAID MY TUITION AS HEJOKINGLY CALLED IT AND LEFT. I TOLD HIM SMILING THAT I WOULD GET EVENWITH HIM FOR HIS MISTAKE AND HE LAUGHED HEARTILY AND ASKED ME TO CALLONCE IN A WHILE. I DID SO HOPING FOR A CHANCE TO EVEN UP ACCOUNTS BUTHE GAVE ME NONE AND I TOLD HIM I WOULD WAIT.THE FALL FROM MY HORSE HAD FORTUNATELY LEFT NO EVIL RESULTS ON THECONTRARY IT HAD CHANGED MY WHOLE CHARACTER FOR THE BETTER. FROM A LAZYYOUNG MAN ABOUT TOWN I HAD BECOME ACTIVE ENERGETIC TEMPERATE ANDABOVE ALLOH ABOVE ALL ELSEAMBITIOUS. THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING WHICHTROUBLED ME I LAUGHED AT MY OWN UNEASINESS AND YET IT TROUBLED ME.DURING MY CONVALESCENCE I HAD BOUGHT AND READ FOR THE FIRST TIME THEKING IN YELLOW. I REMEMBER AFTER FINISHING THE FIRST ACT THAT ITOCCURRED TO ME THAT I HAD BETTER STOP. I STARTED UP AND FLUNG THE BOOKINTO THE FIREPLACE THE VOLUME STRUCK THE BARRED GRATE AND FELL OPEN ONTHE HEARTH IN THE FIRELIGHT. IF I HAD NOT CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE OPENINGWORDS IN THE SECOND ACT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE FINISHED IT BUT AS I STOOPEDTO PICK IT UP MY EYES BECAME RIVETED TO THE OPEN PAGE AND WITH A CRY OFTERROR OR PERHAPS IT WAS OF JOY SO POIGNANT THAT I SUFFERED IN EVERYNERVE I SNATCHED THE THING OUT OF THE COALS AND CREPT SHAKING TO MYBEDROOM WHERE I READ IT AND REREAD IT AND WEPT AND LAUGHED AND TREMBLEDWITH A HORROR WHICH AT TIMES ASSAILS ME YET. THIS IS THE THING THATTROUBLES ME FOR I CANNOT FORGET CARCOSA WHERE BLACK STARS HANG IN THEHEAVENS WHERE THE SHADOWS OF MENS THOUGHTS LENGTHEN IN THE AFTERNOONWHEN THE TWIN SUNS SINK INTO THE LAKE OF HALI AND MY MIND WILL BEAR FOREVER THE MEMORY OF THE PALLID MASK. I PRAY GOD WILL CURSE THE WRITER ASTHE WRITER HAS CURSED THE WORLD WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL STUPENDOUS CREATIONTERRIBLE IN ITS SIMPLICITY IRRESISTIBLE IN ITS TRUTHA WORLD WHICH NOWTREMBLES BEFORE THE KING IN YELLOW. WHEN THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SEIZED THETRANSLATED COPIES WHICH HAD JUST ARRIVED IN PARIS LONDON OF COURSEBECAME EAGER TO READ IT. IT IS WELL KNOWN HOW THE BOOK SPREAD LIKE ANINFECTIOUS DISEASE FROM CITY TO CITY FROM CONTINENT TO CONTINENTBARRED OUT HERE CONFISCATED THERE DENOUNCED BY PRESS AND PULPITCENSURED EVEN BY THE MOST ADVANCED OF LITERARY ANARCHISTS. NO DEFINITEPRINCIPLES HAD BEEN VIOLATED IN THOSE WICKED PAGES NO DOCTRINEPROMULGATED NO CONVICTIONS OUTRAGED. IT COULD NOT BE JUDGED BY ANY KNOWNSTANDARD YET ALTHOUGH IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE SUPREME NOTE OF ARTHAD BEEN STRUCK IN THE KING IN YELLOW ALL FELT THAT HUMAN NATURECOULD NOT BEAR THE STRAIN NOR THRIVE ON WORDS IN WHICH THE ESSENCE OFPUREST POISON LURKED. THE VERY BANALITY AND INNOCENCE OF THE FIRST ACTONLY ALLOWED THE BLOW TO FALL AFTERWARD WITH MORE AWFUL EFFECT.IT WAS I REMEMBER THE TH DAY OF APRIL  THAT THE FIRSTGOVERNMENT LETHAL CHAMBER WAS ESTABLISHED ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF WASHINGTONSQUARE BETWEEN WOOSTER STREET AND SOUTH FIFTH AVENUE. THE BLOCK WHICHHAD FORMERLY CONSISTED OF A LOT OF SHABBY OLD BUILDINGS USED AS CAFSAND RESTAURANTS FOR FOREIGNERS HAD BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE GOVERNMENT INTHE WINTER OF . THE FRENCH AND ITALIAN CAFS AND RESTAURANTS WERETORN DOWN THE WHOLE BLOCK WAS ENCLOSED BY A GILDED IRON RAILING ANDCONVERTED INTO A LOVELY GARDEN WITH LAWNS FLOWERS AND FOUNTAINS. IN THECENTRE OF THE GARDEN STOOD A SMALL WHITE BUILDING SEVERELY CLASSICAL INARCHITECTURE AND SURROUNDED BY THICKETS OF FLOWERS. SIX IONIC COLUMNSSUPPORTED THE ROOF AND THE SINGLE DOOR WAS OF BRONZE. A SPLENDID MARBLEGROUP OF THE FATES STOOD BEFORE THE DOOR THE WORK OF A YOUNG AMERICANSCULPTOR BORIS YVAIN WHO HAD DIED IN PARIS WHEN ONLY TWENTYTHREE YEARSOLD.THE INAUGURATION CEREMONIES WERE IN PROGRESS AS I CROSSED UNIVERSITYPLACE AND ENTERED THE SQUARE. I THREADED MY WAY THROUGH THE SILENT THRONGOF SPECTATORS BUT WAS STOPPED AT FOURTH STREET BY A CORDON OF POLICE. AREGIMENT OF UNITED STATES LANCERS WERE DRAWN UP IN A HOLLOW SQUARE ROUNDTHE LETHAL CHAMBER. ON A RAISED TRIBUNE FACING WASHINGTON PARK STOOD THEGOVERNOR OF NEW YORK AND BEHIND HIM WERE GROUPED THE MAYOR OF NEWYORK AND BROOKLYN THE INSPECTORGENERAL OF POLICE THE COMMANDANT OFTHE STATE TROOPS COLONEL LIVINGSTON MILITARY AID TO THE PRESIDENT OF THEUNITED STATES GENERAL BLOUNT COMMANDING AT GOVERNORS ISLANDMAJORGENERAL HAMILTON COMMANDING THE GARRISON OF NEW YORK AND BROOKLYNADMIRAL BUFFBY OF THE FLEET IN THE NORTH RIVER SURGEONGENERALLANCEFORD THE STAFF OF THE NATIONAL FREE HOSPITAL SENATORS WYSE ANDFRANKLIN OF NEW YORK AND THE COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS. THE TRIBUNEWAS SURROUNDED BY A SQUADRON OF HUSSARS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD.THE GOVERNOR WAS FINISHING HIS REPLY TO THE SHORT SPEECH OF THESURGEONGENERAL. I HEARD HIM SAY THE LAWS PROHIBITING SUICIDE ANDPROVIDING PUNISHMENT FOR ANY ATTEMPT AT SELFDESTRUCTION HAVE BEENREPEALED. THE GOVERNMENT HAS SEEN FIT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE RIGHT OF MAN TOEND AN EXISTENCE WHICH MAY HAVE BECOME INTOLERABLE TO HIM THROUGHPHYSICAL SUFFERING OR MENTAL DESPAIR. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE COMMUNITYWILL BE BENEFITED BY THE REMOVAL OF SUCH PEOPLE FROM THEIR MIDST. SINCETHE PASSAGE OF THIS LAW THE NUMBER OF SUICIDES IN THE UNITED STATES HASNOT INCREASED. NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS DETERMINED TO ESTABLISH A LETHALCHAMBER IN EVERY CITY TOWN AND VILLAGE IN THE COUNTRY IT REMAINS TO BESEEN WHETHER OR NOT THAT CLASS OF HUMAN CREATURES FROM WHOSE DESPONDINGRANKS NEW VICTIMS OF SELFDESTRUCTION FALL DAILY WILL ACCEPT THE RELIEFTHUS PROVIDED. HE PAUSED AND TURNED TO THE WHITE LETHAL CHAMBER. THESILENCE IN THE STREET WAS ABSOLUTE. THERE A PAINLESS DEATH AWAITS HIMWHO CAN NO LONGER BEAR THE SORROWS OF THIS LIFE. IF DEATH IS WELCOME LETHIM SEEK IT THERE. THEN QUICKLY TURNING TO THE MILITARY AID OF THEPRESIDENTS HOUSEHOLD HE SAID I DECLARE THE LETHAL CHAMBER OPEN ANDAGAIN FACING THE VAST CROWD HE CRIED IN A CLEAR VOICE CITIZENS OF NEWYORK AND OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THROUGH ME THE GOVERNMENTDECLARES THE LETHAL CHAMBER TO BE OPEN.THE SOLEMN HUSH WAS BROKEN BY A SHARP CRY OF COMMAND THE SQUADRON OFHUSSARS FILED AFTER THE GOVERNORS CARRIAGE THE LANCERS WHEELED ANDFORMED ALONG FIFTH AVENUE TO WAIT FOR THE COMMANDANT OF THE GARRISON ANDTHE MOUNTED POLICE FOLLOWED THEM. I LEFT THE CROWD TO GAPE AND STARE ATTHE WHITE MARBLE DEATH CHAMBER AND CROSSING SOUTH FIFTH AVENUE WALKEDALONG THE WESTERN SIDE OF THAT THOROUGHFARE TO BLEECKER STREET. THEN ITURNED TO THE RIGHT AND STOPPED BEFORE A DINGY SHOP WHICH BORE THE SIGNHAWBERK ARMOURER.I GLANCED IN AT THE DOORWAY AND SAW HAWBERK BUSY IN HIS LITTLE SHOP ATTHE END OF THE HALL. HE LOOKED UP AND CATCHING SIGHT OF ME CRIED IN HISDEEP HEARTY VOICE COME IN MR. CASTAIGNE CONSTANCE HIS DAUGHTERROSE TO MEET ME AS I CROSSED THE THRESHOLD AND HELD OUT HER PRETTYHAND BUT I SAW THE BLUSH OF DISAPPOINTMENT ON HER CHEEKS AND KNEWTHAT IT WAS ANOTHER CASTAIGNE SHE HAD EXPECTED MY COUSIN LOUIS. ISMILED AT HER CONFUSION AND COMPLIMENTED HER ON THE BANNER SHE WASEMBROIDERING FROM A COLOURED PLATE. OLD HAWBERK SAT RIVETING THE WORNGREAVES OF SOME ANCIENT SUIT OF ARMOUR AND THE TING TING TING OF HISLITTLE HAMMER SOUNDED PLEASANTLY IN THE QUAINT SHOP. PRESENTLY HEDROPPED HIS HAMMER AND FUSSED ABOUT FOR A MOMENT WITH A TINY WRENCH.THE SOFT CLASH OF THE MAIL SENT A THRILL OF PLEASURE THROUGH ME. ILOVED TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF STEEL BRUSHING AGAINST STEEL THE MELLOWSHOCK OF THE MALLET ON THIGH PIECES AND THE JINGLE OF CHAIN ARMOUR.THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON I WENT TO SEE HAWBERK. HE HAD NEVER INTERESTEDME PERSONALLY NOR DID CONSTANCE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT OF HER BEING INLOVE WITH LOUIS. THIS DID OCCUPY MY ATTENTION AND SOMETIMES EVEN KEPTME AWAKE AT NIGHT. BUT I KNEW IN MY HEART THAT ALL WOULD COME RIGHTAND THAT I SHOULD ARRANGE THEIR FUTURE AS I EXPECTED TO ARRANGE THAT OFMY KIND DOCTOR JOHN ARCHER. HOWEVER I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TROUBLEDMYSELF ABOUT VISITING THEM JUST THEN HAD IT NOT BEEN AS I SAY THATTHE MUSIC OF THE TINKLING HAMMER HAD FOR ME THIS STRONG FASCINATION. IWOULD SIT FOR HOURS LISTENING AND LISTENING AND WHEN A STRAY SUNBEAMSTRUCK THE INLAID STEEL THE SENSATION IT GAVE ME WAS ALMOST TOO KEENTO ENDURE. MY EYES WOULD BECOME FIXED DILATING WITH A PLEASURE THATSTRETCHED EVERY NERVE ALMOST TO BREAKING UNTIL SOME MOVEMENT OF THEOLD ARMOURER CUT OFF THE RAY OF SUNLIGHT THEN STILL THRILLINGSECRETLY I LEANED BACK AND LISTENED AGAIN TO THE SOUND OF THEPOLISHING RAG SWISH SWISH RUBBING RUST FROM THE RIVETS.CONSTANCE WORKED WITH THE EMBROIDERY OVER HER KNEES NOW AND THEN PAUSINGTO EXAMINE MORE CLOSELY THE PATTERN IN THE COLOURED PLATE FROM THEMETROPOLITAN MUSEUM.WHO IS THIS FOR I ASKED.HAWBERK EXPLAINED THAT IN ADDITION TO THE TREASURES OF ARMOUR IN THEMETROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF WHICH HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ARMOURER HE ALSOHAD CHARGE OF SEVERAL COLLECTIONS BELONGING TO RICH AMATEURS. THIS WAS THEMISSING GREAVE OF A FAMOUS SUIT WHICH A CLIENT OF HIS HAD TRACED TO ALITTLE SHOP IN PARIS ON THE QUAI DORSAY. HE HAWBERK HAD NEGOTIATED FORAND SECURED THE GREAVE AND NOW THE SUIT WAS COMPLETE. HE LAID DOWN HISHAMMER AND READ ME THE HISTORY OF THE SUIT TRACED SINCE  FROM OWNERTO OWNER UNTIL IT WAS ACQUIRED BY THOMAS STAINBRIDGE. WHEN HIS SUPERBCOLLECTION WAS SOLD THIS CLIENT OF HAWBERKS BOUGHT THE SUIT AND SINCETHEN THE SEARCH FOR THE MISSING GREAVE HAD BEEN PUSHED UNTIL IT WASALMOST BY ACCIDENT LOCATED IN PARIS.DID YOU CONTINUE THE SEARCH SO PERSISTENTLY WITHOUT ANY CERTAINTY OF THEGREAVE BEING STILL IN EXISTENCE I DEMANDED.OF COURSE HE REPLIED COOLLY.THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME I TOOK A PERSONAL INTEREST IN HAWBERK.IT WAS WORTH SOMETHING TO YOU I VENTURED.NO HE REPLIED LAUGHING MY PLEASURE IN FINDING IT WAS MY REWARD.HAVE YOU NO AMBITION TO BE RICH I ASKED SMILING.MY ONE AMBITION IS TO BE THE BEST ARMOURER IN THE WORLD HE ANSWEREDGRAVELY.CONSTANCE ASKED ME IF I HAD SEEN THE CEREMONIES AT THE LETHAL CHAMBER.SHE HERSELF HAD NOTICED CAVALRY PASSING UP BROADWAY THAT MORNING AND HADWISHED TO SEE THE INAUGURATION BUT HER FATHER WANTED THE BANNERFINISHED AND SHE HAD STAYED AT HIS REQUEST.DID YOU SEE YOUR COUSIN MR. CASTAIGNE THERE SHE ASKED WITH THESLIGHTEST TREMOR OF HER SOFT EYELASHES.NO I REPLIED CARELESSLY. LOUIS REGIMENT IS MANOEUVRING OUT INWESTCHESTER COUNTY. I ROSE AND PICKED UP MY HAT AND CANE.ARE YOU GOING UPSTAIRS TO SEE THE LUNATIC AGAIN LAUGHED OLD HAWBERK.IF HAWBERK KNEW HOW I LOATHE THAT WORD LUNATIC HE WOULD NEVER USE ITIN MY PRESENCE. IT ROUSES CERTAIN FEELINGS WITHIN ME WHICH I DO NOT CARETO EXPLAIN. HOWEVER I ANSWERED HIM QUIETLY I THINK I SHALL DROP IN ANDSEE MR. WILDE FOR A MOMENT OR TWO.POOR FELLOW SAID CONSTANCE WITH A SHAKE OF THE HEAD IT MUST BE HARDTO LIVE ALONE YEAR AFTER YEAR POOR CRIPPLED AND ALMOST DEMENTED. IT ISVERY GOOD OF YOU MR. CASTAIGNE TO VISIT HIM AS OFTEN AS YOU DO.I THINK HE IS VICIOUS OBSERVED HAWBERK BEGINNING AGAIN WITH HISHAMMER. I LISTENED TO THE GOLDEN TINKLE ON THE GREAVE PLATES WHEN HE HADFINISHED I REPLIEDNO HE IS NOT VICIOUS NOR IS HE IN THE LEAST DEMENTED. HIS MIND IS AWONDER CHAMBER FROM WHICH HE CAN EXTRACT TREASURES THAT YOU AND I WOULDGIVE YEARS OF OUR LIFE TO ACQUIRE.HAWBERK LAUGHED.I CONTINUED A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY HE KNOWS HISTORY AS NO ONE ELSE COULDKNOW IT. NOTHING HOWEVER TRIVIAL ESCAPES HIS SEARCH AND HIS MEMORY ISSO ABSOLUTE SO PRECISE IN DETAILS THAT WERE IT KNOWN IN NEW YORK THATSUCH A MAN EXISTED THE PEOPLE COULD NOT HONOUR HIM ENOUGH.NONSENSE MUTTERED HAWBERK SEARCHING ON THE FLOOR FOR A FALLEN RIVET.IS IT NONSENSE I ASKED MANAGING TO SUPPRESS WHAT I FELT IS ITNONSENSE WHEN HE SAYS THAT THE TASSETS AND CUISSARDS OF THE ENAMELLEDSUIT OF ARMOUR COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE PRINCES EMBLAZONED CAN BE FOUNDAMONG A MASS OF RUSTY THEATRICAL PROPERTIES BROKEN STOVES ANDRAGPICKERS REFUSE IN A GARRET IN PELL STREETHAWBERKS HAMMER FELL TO THE GROUND BUT HE PICKED IT UP AND ASKED WITHA GREAT DEAL OF CALM HOW I KNEW THAT THE TASSETS AND LEFT CUISSARD WEREMISSING FROM THE PRINCES EMBLAZONED.I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL MR. WILDE MENTIONED IT TO ME THE OTHER DAY. HE SAIDTHEY WERE IN THE GARRET OF  PELL STREET.NONSENSE HE CRIED BUT I NOTICED HIS HAND TREMBLING UNDER HIS LEATHERNAPRON.IS THIS NONSENSE TOO I ASKED PLEASANTLY IS IT NONSENSE WHEN MR.WILDE CONTINUALLY SPEAKS OF YOU AS THE MARQUIS OF AVONSHIRE AND OF MISSCONSTANCEI DID NOT FINISH FOR CONSTANCE HAD STARTED TO HER FEET WITH TERRORWRITTEN ON EVERY FEATURE. HAWBERK LOOKED AT ME AND SLOWLY SMOOTHED HISLEATHERN APRON.THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE HE OBSERVED MR. WILDE MAY KNOW A GREAT MANYTHINGSABOUT ARMOUR FOR INSTANCE AND THE PRINCES EMBLAZONED IINTERPOSED SMILING.YES HE CONTINUED SLOWLY ABOUT ARMOUR ALSOMAY BEBUT HE IS WRONGIN REGARD TO THE MARQUIS OF AVONSHIRE WHO AS YOU KNOW KILLED HISWIFES TRADUCER YEARS AGO AND WENT TO AUSTRALIA WHERE HE DID NOT LONGSURVIVE HIS WIFE.MR. WILDE IS WRONG MURMURED CONSTANCE. HER LIPS WERE BLANCHED BUT HERVOICE WAS SWEET AND CALM.LET US AGREE IF YOU PLEASE THAT IN THIS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE MR. WILDE ISWRONG I SAID.III CLIMBED THE THREE DILAPIDATED FLIGHTS OF STAIRS WHICH I HAD SO OFTENCLIMBED BEFORE AND KNOCKED AT A SMALL DOOR AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR.MR. WILDE OPENED THE DOOR AND I WALKED IN.WHEN HE HAD DOUBLELOCKED THE DOOR AND PUSHED A HEAVY CHEST AGAINST ITHE CAME AND SAT DOWN BESIDE ME PEERING UP INTO MY FACE WITH HIS LITTLELIGHTCOLOURED EYES. HALF A DOZEN NEW SCRATCHES COVERED HIS NOSE ANDCHEEKS AND THE SILVER WIRES WHICH SUPPORTED HIS ARTIFICIAL EARS HADBECOME DISPLACED. I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SO HIDEOUSLYFASCINATING. HE HAD NO EARS. THE ARTIFICIAL ONES WHICH NOW STOOD OUT ATAN ANGLE FROM THE FINE WIRE WERE HIS ONE WEAKNESS. THEY WERE MADE OF WAXAND PAINTED A SHELL PINK BUT THE REST OF HIS FACE WAS YELLOW. HE MIGHTBETTER HAVE REVELLED IN THE LUXURY OF SOME ARTIFICIAL FINGERS FOR HISLEFT HAND WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY FINGERLESS BUT IT SEEMED TO CAUSE HIM NOINCONVENIENCE AND HE WAS SATISFIED WITH HIS WAX EARS. HE WAS VERY SMALLSCARCELY HIGHER THAN A CHILD OF TEN BUT HIS ARMS WERE MAGNIFICENTLYDEVELOPED AND HIS THIGHS AS THICK AS ANY ATHLETES. STILL THE MOSTREMARKABLE THING ABOUT MR. WILDE WAS THAT A MAN OF HIS MARVELLOUSINTELLIGENCE AND KNOWLEDGE SHOULD HAVE SUCH A HEAD. IT WAS FLAT ANDPOINTED LIKE THE HEADS OF MANY OF THOSE UNFORTUNATES WHOM PEOPLEIMPRISON IN ASYLUMS FOR THE WEAKMINDED. MANY CALLED HIM INSANE BUT IKNEW HIM TO BE AS SANE AS I WAS.I DO NOT DENY THAT HE WAS ECCENTRIC THE MANIA HE HAD FOR KEEPING THATCAT AND TEASING HER UNTIL SHE FLEW AT HIS FACE LIKE A DEMON WASCERTAINLY ECCENTRIC. I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND WHY HE KEPT THE CREATURENOR WHAT PLEASURE HE FOUND IN SHUTTING HIMSELF UP IN HIS ROOM WITH THISSURLY VICIOUS BEAST. I REMEMBER ONCE GLANCING UP FROM THE MANUSCRIPT IWAS STUDYING BY THE LIGHT OF SOME TALLOW DIPS AND SEEING MR. WILDESQUATTING MOTIONLESS ON HIS HIGH CHAIR HIS EYES FAIRLY BLAZING WITHEXCITEMENT WHILE THE CAT WHICH HAD RISEN FROM HER PLACE BEFORE THESTOVE CAME CREEPING ACROSS THE FLOOR RIGHT AT HIM. BEFORE I COULD MOVESHE FLATTENED HER BELLY TO THE GROUND CROUCHED TREMBLED AND SPRANGINTO HIS FACE. HOWLING AND FOAMING THEY ROLLED OVER AND OVER ON THEFLOOR SCRATCHING AND CLAWING UNTIL THE CAT SCREAMED AND FLED UNDER THECABINET AND MR. WILDE TURNED OVER ON HIS BACK HIS LIMBS CONTRACTING ANDCURLING UP LIKE THE LEGS OF A DYING SPIDER. HE WAS ECCENTRIC.MR. WILDE HAD CLIMBED INTO HIS HIGH CHAIR AND AFTER STUDYING MY FACEPICKED UP A DOGSEARED LEDGER AND OPENED IT.HENRY B.

THE CAT CEASEDSNARLING AND PRESENTLY BEGAN A LOUD PURRING WHICH SEEMED TO INCREASE INTIMBRE AS HE STROKED HER. WHERE ARE THE NOTES I ASKED.

PERHAPS CONSTANCEDOES NOT LOVE HIM HE SUGGESTED.I STARTED TO REPLY BUT A SUDDEN BURST OF MILITARY MUSIC FROM THE STREETBELOW DROWNED MY VOICE. THE TWENTIETH DRAGOON REGIMENT FORMERLY INGARRISON AT MOUNT ST. VINCENT WAS RETURNING FROM THE MANOEUVRES INWESTCHESTER COUNTY TO ITS NEW BARRACKS ON EAST WASHINGTON SQUARE. IT WASMY COUSINS REGIMENT. THEY WERE A FINE LOT OF FELLOWS IN THEIR PALEBLUE TIGHTFITTING JACKETS JAUNTY BUSBYS AND WHITE RIDING BREECHES WITHTHE DOUBLE YELLOW STRIPE INTO WHICH THEIR LIMBS SEEMED MOULDED. EVERYOTHER SQUADRON WAS ARMED WITH LANCES FROM THE METAL POINTS OF WHICHFLUTTERED YELLOW AND WHITE PENNONS. THE BAND PASSED PLAYING THEREGIMENTAL MARCH THEN CAME THE COLONEL AND STAFF THE HORSES CROWDINGAND TRAMPLING WHILE THEIR HEADS BOBBED IN UNISON AND THE PENNONSFLUTTERED FROM THEIR LANCE POINTS. THE TROOPERS WHO RODE WITH THEBEAUTIFUL ENGLISH SEAT LOOKED BROWN AS BERRIES FROM THEIR BLOODLESSCAMPAIGN AMONG THE FARMS OF WESTCHESTER AND THE MUSIC OF THEIR SABRESAGAINST THE STIRRUPS AND THE JINGLE OF SPURS AND CARBINES WAS DELIGHTFULTO ME. I SAW LOUIS RIDING WITH HIS SQUADRON. HE WAS AS HANDSOME ANOFFICER AS I HAVE EVER SEEN. MR. WILDE WHO HAD MOUNTED A CHAIR BY THEWINDOW SAW HIM TOO BUT SAID NOTHING. LOUIS TURNED AND LOOKED STRAIGHTAT HAWBERKS SHOP AS HE PASSED AND I COULD SEE THE FLUSH ON HIS BROWNCHEEKS. I THINK CONSTANCE MUST HAVE BEEN AT THE WINDOW. WHEN THE LASTTROOPERS HAD CLATTERED BY AND THE LAST PENNONS VANISHED INTO SOUTH FIFTHAVENUE MR. WILDE CLAMBERED OUT OF HIS CHAIR AND DRAGGED THE CHEST AWAYFROM THE DOOR.YES HE SAID IT IS TIME THAT YOU SAW YOUR COUSIN LOUIS.HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND I PICKED UP MY HAT AND STICK AND STEPPED INTOTHE CORRIDOR. THE STAIRS WERE DARK. GROPING ABOUT I SET MY FOOT ONSOMETHING SOFT WHICH SNARLED AND SPIT AND I AIMED A MURDEROUS BLOW ATTHE CAT BUT MY CANE SHIVERED TO SPLINTERS AGAINST THE BALUSTRADE ANDTHE BEAST SCURRIED BACK INTO MR. WILDES ROOM.PASSING HAWBERKS DOOR AGAIN I SAW HIM STILL AT WORK ON THE ARMOUR BUTI DID NOT STOP AND STEPPING OUT INTO BLEECKER STREET I FOLLOWED IT TOWOOSTER SKIRTED THE GROUNDS OF THE LETHAL CHAMBER AND CROSSINGWASHINGTON PARK WENT STRAIGHT TO MY ROOMS IN THE BENEDICK. HERE I LUNCHEDCOMFORTABLY READ THE HERALD AND THE METEOR AND FINALLY WENTTO THE STEEL SAFE IN MY BEDROOM AND SET THE TIME COMBINATION. THETHREE AND THREEQUARTER MINUTES WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO WAIT WHILE THETIME LOCK IS OPENING ARE TO ME GOLDEN MOMENTS. FROM THE INSTANT I SETTHE COMBINATION TO THE MOMENT WHEN I GRASP THE KNOBS AND SWING BACKTHE SOLID STEEL DOORS I LIVE IN AN ECSTASY OF EXPECTATION. THOSE MOMENTSMUST BE LIKE MOMENTS PASSED IN PARADISE. I KNOW WHAT I AM TO FIND ATTHE END OF THE TIME LIMIT. I KNOW WHAT THE MASSIVE SAFE HOLDS SECURE FORME FOR ME ALONE AND THE EXQUISITE PLEASURE OF WAITING IS HARDLY ENHANCEDWHEN THE SAFE OPENS AND I LIFT FROM ITS VELVET CROWN A DIADEM OF PURESTGOLD BLAZING WITH DIAMONDS. I DO THIS EVERY DAY AND YET THE JOY OFWAITING AND AT LAST TOUCHING AGAIN THE DIADEM ONLY SEEMS TO INCREASE ASTHE DAYS PASS. IT IS A DIADEM FIT FOR A KING AMONG KINGS AN EMPERORAMONG EMPERORS. THE KING IN YELLOW MIGHT SCORN IT BUT IT SHALL BE WORNBY HIS ROYAL SERVANT.I HELD IT IN MY ARMS UNTIL THE ALARM IN THE SAFE RANG HARSHLY AND THENTENDERLY PROUDLY I REPLACED IT AND SHUT THE STEEL DOORS. I WALKEDSLOWLY BACK INTO MY STUDY WHICH FACES WASHINGTON SQUARE AND LEANED ONTHE WINDOW SILL. THE AFTERNOON SUN POURED INTO MY WINDOWS AND A GENTLEBREEZE STIRRED THE BRANCHES OF THE ELMS AND MAPLES IN THE PARK NOWCOVERED WITH BUDS AND TENDER FOLIAGE. A FLOCK OF PIGEONS CIRCLED ABOUTTHE TOWER OF THE MEMORIAL CHURCH SOMETIMES ALIGHTING ON THE PURPLE TILEDROOF SOMETIMES WHEELING DOWNWARD TO THE LOTOS FOUNTAIN IN FRONT OF THEMARBLE ARCH. THE GARDENERS WERE BUSY WITH THE FLOWER BEDS AROUND THEFOUNTAIN AND THE FRESHLY TURNED EARTH SMELLED SWEET AND SPICY. A LAWNMOWER DRAWN BY A FAT WHITE HORSE CLINKED ACROSS THE GREEN SWARD ANDWATERINGCARTS POURED SHOWERS OF SPRAY OVER THE ASPHALT DRIVES. AROUNDTHE STATUE OF PETER STUYVESANT WHICH IN  HAD REPLACED THEMONSTROSITY SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT GARIBALDI CHILDREN PLAYED IN THESPRING SUNSHINE AND NURSE GIRLS WHEELED ELABORATE BABY CARRIAGES WITH ARECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE PASTYFACED OCCUPANTS WHICH COULD PROBABLY BEEXPLAINED BY THE PRESENCE OF HALF A DOZEN TRIM DRAGOON TROOPERS LANGUIDLYLOLLING ON THE BENCHES. THROUGH THE TREES THE WASHINGTON MEMORIAL ARCHGLISTENED LIKE SILVER IN THE SUNSHINE AND BEYOND ON THE EASTERNEXTREMITY OF THE SQUARE THE GREY STONE BARRACKS OF THE DRAGOONS AND THEWHITE GRANITE ARTILLERY STABLES WERE ALIVE WITH COLOUR AND MOTION.I LOOKED AT THE LETHAL CHAMBER ON THE CORNER OF THE SQUARE OPPOSITE. AFEW CURIOUS PEOPLE STILL LINGERED ABOUT THE GILDED IRON RAILING BUTINSIDE THE GROUNDS THE PATHS WERE DESERTED. I WATCHED THE FOUNTAINSRIPPLE AND SPARKLE THE SPARROWS HAD ALREADY FOUND THIS NEW BATHING NOOKAND THE BASINS WERE COVERED WITH THE DUSTYFEATHERED LITTLE THINGS. TWOOR THREE WHITE PEACOCKS PICKED THEIR WAY ACROSS THE LAWNS AND A DRABCOLOURED PIGEON SAT SO MOTIONLESS ON THE ARM OF ONE OF THE FATES THATIT SEEMED TO BE A PART OF THE SCULPTURED STONE.AS I WAS TURNING CARELESSLY AWAY A SLIGHT COMMOTION IN THE GROUP OFCURIOUS LOITERERS AROUND THE GATES ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION. A YOUNG MANHAD ENTERED AND WAS ADVANCING WITH NERVOUS STRIDES ALONG THE GRAVEL PATHWHICH LEADS TO THE BRONZE DOORS OF THE LETHAL CHAMBER. HE PAUSED A MOMENTBEFORE THE FATES AND AS HE RAISED HIS HEAD TO THOSE THREE MYSTERIOUSFACES THE PIGEON ROSE FROM ITS SCULPTURED PERCH CIRCLED ABOUT FOR AMOMENT AND WHEELED TO THE EAST. THE YOUNG MAN PRESSED HIS HAND TO HISFACE AND THEN WITH AN UNDEFINABLE GESTURE SPRANG UP THE MARBLE STEPSTHE BRONZE DOORS CLOSED BEHIND HIM AND HALF AN HOUR LATER THE LOITERERSSLOUCHED AWAY AND THE FRIGHTENED PIGEON RETURNED TO ITS PERCH IN THEARMS OF FATE.I PUT ON MY HAT AND WENT OUT INTO THE PARK FOR A LITTLE WALK BEFOREDINNER. AS I CROSSED THE CENTRAL DRIVEWAY A GROUP OF OFFICERS PASSED ANDONE OF THEM CALLED OUT HELLO HILDRED AND CAME BACK TO SHAKE HANDSWITH ME. IT WAS MY COUSIN LOUIS WHO STOOD SMILING AND TAPPING HISSPURRED HEELS WITH HIS RIDINGWHIP.JUST BACK FROM WESTCHESTER HE SAID BEEN DOING THE BUCOLIC MILK ANDCURDS YOU KNOW DAIRYMAIDS IN SUNBONNETS WHO SAY HAEOW AND I DONTTHINK WHEN YOU TELL THEM THEY ARE PRETTY.

WILDE. HES NOT WELL BRED TO PUT IT GENEROUSLY HE IS HIDEOUSLYDEFORMED HIS HEAD IS THE HEAD OF A CRIMINALLY INSANE PERSON. YOU KNOWYOURSELF HES BEEN IN AN ASYLUMSO HAVE I I INTERRUPTED CALMLY.LOUIS LOOKED STARTLED AND CONFUSED FOR A MOMENT BUT RECOVERED ANDSLAPPED ME HEARTILY ON THE SHOULDER.

LOUIS LOOKED AFTER HIS BROTHER OFFICERS WHOHAD NOW ALMOST REACHED BROADWAY.WE HAD INTENDED TO SAMPLE A BRUNSWICK COCKTAIL BUT TO TELL YOU THETRUTH I WAS ANXIOUS FOR AN EXCUSE TO GO AND SEE HAWBERK INSTEAD. COMEALONG ILL MAKE YOU MY EXCUSE.WE FOUND OLD HAWBERK NEATLY ATTIRED IN A FRESH SPRING SUIT STANDING ATTHE DOOR OF HIS SHOP AND SNIFFING THE AIR.I HAD JUST DECIDED TO TAKE CONSTANCE FOR A LITTLE STROLL BEFORE DINNERHE REPLIED TO THE IMPETUOUS VOLLEY OF QUESTIONS FROM LOUIS. WE THOUGHTOF WALKING ON THE PARK TERRACE ALONG THE NORTH RIVER.AT THAT MOMENT CONSTANCE APPEARED AND GREW PALE AND ROSY BY TURNS ASLOUIS BENT OVER HER SMALL GLOVED FINGERS. I TRIED TO EXCUSE MYSELFALLEGING AN ENGAGEMENT UPTOWN BUT LOUIS AND CONSTANCE WOULD NOT LISTENAND I SAW I WAS EXPECTED TO REMAIN AND ENGAGE OLD HAWBERKS ATTENTION.AFTER ALL IT WOULD BE JUST AS WELL IF I KEPT MY EYE ON LOUIS I THOUGHTAND WHEN THEY HAILED A SPRING STREET HORSECAR I GOT IN AFTER THEM ANDTOOK MY SEAT BESIDE THE ARMOURER.THE BEAUTIFUL LINE OF PARKS AND GRANITE TERRACES OVERLOOKING THE WHARVESALONG THE NORTH RIVER WHICH WERE BUILT IN  AND FINISHED IN THEAUTUMN OF  HAD BECOME ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR PROMENADES IN THEMETROPOLIS. THEY EXTENDED FROM THE BATTERY TO TH STREET OVERLOOKINGTHE NOBLE RIVER AND AFFORDING A FINE VIEW OF THE JERSEY SHORE AND THEHIGHLANDS OPPOSITE. CAFS AND RESTAURANTS WERE SCATTERED HERE AND THEREAMONG THE TREES AND TWICE A WEEK MILITARY BANDS FROM THE GARRISON PLAYEDIN THE KIOSQUES ON THE PARAPETS.WE SAT DOWN IN THE SUNSHINE ON THE BENCH AT THE FOOT OF THE EQUESTRIANSTATUE OF GENERAL SHERIDAN. CONSTANCE TIPPED HER SUNSHADE TO SHIELD HEREYES AND SHE AND LOUIS BEGAN A MURMURING CONVERSATION WHICH WASIMPOSSIBLE TO CATCH. OLD HAWBERK LEANING ON HIS IVORY HEADED CANELIGHTED AN EXCELLENT CIGAR THE MATE TO WHICH I POLITELY REFUSED ANDSMILED AT VACANCY. THE SUN HUNG LOW ABOVE THE STATEN ISLAND WOODS ANDTHE BAY WAS DYED WITH GOLDEN HUES REFLECTED FROM THE SUNWARMED SAILS OFTHE SHIPPING IN THE HARBOUR.BRIGS SCHOONERS YACHTS CLUMSY FERRYBOATS THEIR DECKS SWARMING WITHPEOPLE RAILROAD TRANSPORTS CARRYING LINES OF BROWN BLUE AND WHITEFREIGHT CARS STATELY SOUND STEAMERS DCLASS TRAMP STEAMERS COASTERSDREDGERS SCOWS AND EVERYWHERE PERVADING THE ENTIRE BAY IMPUDENT LITTLETUGS PUFFING AND WHISTLING OFFICIOUSLYTHESE WERE THE CRAFT WHICHCHURNED THE SUNLIGHT WATERS AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH.

THOSE TWO SQUATTY LOOKING CHUNKS OF METAL WHICH AREANCHORED THERE OFF CASTLE WILLIAM ARE THE DOUBLE TURRETED MONITORSTERRIBLE AND MAGNIFICENT BEHIND THEM LIES THE RAM OSCEOLA.CONSTANCE LOOKED AT HIM WITH DEEP APPROVAL IN HER BEAUTIFUL EYES. WHATLOADS OF THINGS YOU KNOW FOR A SOLDIER SHE SAID AND WE ALL JOINED INTHE LAUGH WHICH FOLLOWED.PRESENTLY LOUIS ROSE WITH A NOD TO US AND OFFERED HIS ARM TO CONSTANCEAND THEY STROLLED AWAY ALONG THE RIVER WALL. HAWBERK WATCHED THEM FOR AMOMENT AND THEN TURNED TO ME.MR. WILDE WAS RIGHT HE SAID.

HAWBERK LOOKED AT HIS WATCH. AT THE SAME MOMENT A PUFF OF SMOKESHOT FROM THE CASEMATES OF CASTLE WILLIAM AND THE BOOM OF THE SUNSET GUNROLLED ACROSS THE WATER AND WAS REECHOED FROM THE HIGHLANDS OPPOSITE.THE FLAG CAME RUNNING DOWN FROM THE FLAGPOLE THE BUGLES SOUNDED ON THEWHITE DECKS OF THE WARSHIPS AND THE FIRST ELECTRIC LIGHT SPARKLED OUTFROM THE JERSEY SHORE.AS I TURNED INTO THE CITY WITH HAWBERK I HEARD CONSTANCE MURMUR SOMETHINGTO LOUIS WHICH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND BUT LOUIS WHISPERED MY DARLING INREPLY AND AGAIN WALKING AHEAD WITH HAWBERK THROUGH THE SQUARE I HEARD AMURMUR OF SWEETHEART AND MY OWN CONSTANCE AND I KNEW THE TIME HADNEARLY ARRIVED WHEN I SHOULD SPEAK OF IMPORTANT MATTERS WITH MY COUSINLOUIS.IIIONE MORNING EARLY IN MAY I STOOD BEFORE THE STEEL SAFE IN MY BEDROOMTRYING ON THE GOLDEN JEWELLED CROWN. THE DIAMONDS FLASHED FIRE AS ITURNED TO THE MIRROR AND THE HEAVY BEATEN GOLD BURNED LIKE A HALO ABOUTMY HEAD. I REMEMBERED CAMILLAS AGONIZED SCREAM AND THE AWFUL WORDSECHOING THROUGH THE DIM STREETS OF CARCOSA. THEY WERE THE LAST LINES INTHE FIRST ACT AND I DARED NOT THINK OF WHAT FOLLOWEDDARED NOT EVENIN THE SPRING SUNSHINE THERE IN MY OWN ROOM SURROUNDED WITH FAMILIAROBJECTS REASSURED BY THE BUSTLE FROM THE STREET AND THE VOICES OF THESERVANTS IN THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE. FOR THOSE POISONED WORDS HAD DROPPEDSLOWLY INTO MY HEART AS DEATHSWEAT DROPS UPON A BEDSHEET AND ISABSORBED. TREMBLING I PUT THE DIADEM FROM MY HEAD AND WIPED MY FOREHEADBUT I THOUGHT OF HASTUR AND OF MY OWN RIGHTFUL AMBITION AND I REMEMBEREDMR. WILDE AS I HAD LAST LEFT HIM HIS FACE ALL TORN AND BLOODY FROM THECLAWS OF THAT DEVILS CREATURE AND WHAT HE SAIDAH WHAT HE SAID. THEALARM BELL IN THE SAFE BEGAN TO WHIRR HARSHLY AND I KNEW MY TIME WAS UPBUT I WOULD NOT HEED IT AND REPLACING THE FLASHING CIRCLET UPON MY HEADI TURNED DEFIANTLY TO THE MIRROR. I STOOD FOR A LONG TIME ABSORBED IN THECHANGING EXPRESSION OF MY OWN EYES. THE MIRROR REFLECTED A FACE WHICH WASLIKE MY OWN BUT WHITER AND SO THIN THAT I HARDLY RECOGNIZED IT AND ALLTHE TIME I KEPT REPEATING BETWEEN MY CLENCHED TEETH THE DAY HAS COMETHE DAY HAS COME WHILE THE ALARM IN THE SAFE WHIRRED AND CLAMOURED ANDTHE DIAMONDS SPARKLED AND FLAMED ABOVE MY BROW. I HEARD A DOOR OPEN BUTDID NOT HEED IT. IT WAS ONLY WHEN I SAW TWO FACES IN THE MIRRORIT WASONLY WHEN ANOTHER FACE ROSE OVER MY SHOULDER AND TWO OTHER EYES METMINE. I WHEELED LIKE A FLASH AND SEIZED A LONG KNIFE FROM MYDRESSINGTABLE AND MY COUSIN SPRANG BACK VERY PALE CRYING HILDREDFOR GODS SAKE THEN AS MY HAND FELL HE SAID IT IS I LOUIS DONTYOU KNOW ME I STOOD SILENT.

WHATS IT FORI DID NOT ANSWER BUT TOOK THE CIRCLET FROM HIS HANDS AND PLACING IT INTHE SAFE SHUT THE MASSIVE STEEL DOOR. THE ALARM CEASED ITS INFERNAL DINAT ONCE. HE WATCHED ME CURIOUSLY BUT DID NOT SEEM TO NOTICE THE SUDDENCEASING OF THE ALARM. HE DID HOWEVER SPEAK OF THE SAFE AS A BISCUITBOX. FEARING LEST HE MIGHT EXAMINE THE COMBINATION I LED THE WAY INTO MYSTUDY. LOUIS THREW HIMSELF ON THE SOFA AND FLICKED AT FLIES WITH HISETERNAL RIDINGWHIP.

MY SEARCH WAS FRUITLESS AND AFTER A WHILE I GAVE IT UP ANDCAME BACK TO FIND MR. WILDE SQUATTING ON HIS HIGH CHAIR BY THE TABLE. HEHAD WASHED HIS FACE AND CHANGED HIS CLOTHES. THE GREAT FURROWS WHICH THECATS CLAWS HAD PLOUGHED UP IN HIS FACE HE HAD FILLED WITH COLLODION ANDA RAG HID THE WOUND IN HIS THROAT. I TOLD HIM I SHOULD KILL THE CAT WHENI CAME ACROSS HER BUT HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND TURNED TO THE OPENLEDGER BEFORE HIM.

HIS EYES WERE SOBLANK AND VACANT THAT I IMAGINED HE HAD BECOME HALFWITTED AND REMARKEDIT TO MR. WILDE WHO REPLIED THAT IT WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE ANYWAY. VERYPATIENTLY WE POINTED OUT TO VANCE WHAT HIS SHARE IN THE AFFAIR WOULD BEAND HE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND AFTER A WHILE. MR. WILDE EXPLAINED THEMANUSCRIPT USING SEVERAL VOLUMES ON HERALDRY TO SUBSTANTIATE THE RESULTOF HIS RESEARCHES. HE MENTIONED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DYNASTY INCARCOSA THE LAKES WHICH CONNECTED HASTUR ALDEBARAN AND THE MYSTERY OFTHE HYADES. HE SPOKE OF CASSILDA AND CAMILLA AND SOUNDED THE CLOUDYDEPTHS OF DEMHE AND THE LAKE OF HALI. THE SCOLLOPED TATTERS OF THE KINGIN YELLOW MUST HIDE YHTILL FOREVER HE MUTTERED BUT I DO NOT BELIEVEVANCE HEARD HIM. THEN BY DEGREES HE LED VANCE ALONG THE RAMIFICATIONS OFTHE IMPERIAL FAMILY TO UOHT AND THALE FROM NAOTALBA AND PHANTOM OFTRUTH TO ALDONES AND THEN TOSSING ASIDE HIS MANUSCRIPT AND NOTES HEBEGAN THE WONDERFUL STORY OF THE LAST KING. FASCINATED AND THRILLED IWATCHED HIM. HE THREW UP HIS HEAD HIS LONG ARMS WERE STRETCHED OUT IN AMAGNIFICENT GESTURE OF PRIDE AND POWER AND HIS EYES BLAZED DEEP IN THEIRSOCKETS LIKE TWO EMERALDS. VANCE LISTENED STUPEFIED. AS FOR ME WHEN ATLAST MR. WILDE HAD FINISHED AND POINTING TO ME CRIED THE COUSIN OFTHE KING MY HEAD SWAM WITH EXCITEMENT.CONTROLLING MYSELF WITH A SUPERHUMAN EFFORT I EXPLAINED TO VANCE WHY IALONE WAS WORTHY OF THE CROWN AND WHY MY COUSIN MUST BE EXILED OR DIE.I MADE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT MY COUSIN MUST NEVER MARRY EVEN AFTERRENOUNCING ALL HIS CLAIMS AND HOW THAT LEAST OF ALL HE SHOULD MARRY THEDAUGHTER OF THE MARQUIS OF AVONSHIRE AND BRING ENGLAND INTO THE QUESTION.I SHOWED HIM A LIST OF THOUSANDS OF NAMES WHICH MR. WILDE HAD DRAWN UPEVERY MAN WHOSE NAME WAS THERE HAD RECEIVED THE YELLOW SIGN WHICH NOLIVING HUMAN BEING DARED DISREGARD. THE CITY THE STATE THE WHOLE LANDWERE READY TO RISE AND TREMBLE BEFORE THE PALLID MASK.THE TIME HAD COME THE PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THE SON OF HASTUR AND THEWHOLE WORLD BOW TO THE BLACK STARS WHICH HANG IN THE SKY OVER CARCOSA.VANCE LEANED ON THE TABLE HIS HEAD BURIED IN HIS HANDS. MR. WILDE DREWA ROUGH SKETCH ON THE MARGIN OF YESTERDAYS HERALD WITH A BIT OFLEAD PENCIL. IT WAS A PLAN OF HAWBERKS ROOMS. THEN HE WROTE OUT THEORDER AND AFFIXED THE SEAL AND SHAKING LIKE A PALSIED MAN I SIGNED MYFIRST WRIT OF EXECUTION WITH MY NAME HILDREDREX.MR. WILDE CLAMBERED TO THE FLOOR AND UNLOCKING THE CABINET TOOK A LONGSQUARE BOX FROM THE FIRST SHELF. THIS HE BROUGHT TO THE TABLE AND OPENED.A NEW KNIFE LAY IN THE TISSUE PAPER INSIDE AND I PICKED IT UP AND HANDEDIT TO VANCE ALONG WITH THE ORDER AND THE PLAN OF HAWBERKS APARTMENT.THEN MR. WILDE TOLD VANCE HE COULD GO AND HE WENT SHAMBLING LIKE ANOUTCAST OF THE SLUMS.I SAT FOR A WHILE WATCHING THE DAYLIGHT FADE BEHIND THE SQUARE TOWER OFTHE JUDSON MEMORIAL CHURCH AND FINALLY GATHERING UP THE MANUSCRIPT ANDNOTES TOOK MY HAT AND STARTED FOR THE DOOR.MR. WILDE WATCHED ME IN SILENCE. WHEN I HAD STEPPED INTO THE HALL ILOOKED BACK. MR. WILDES SMALL EYES WERE STILL FIXED ON ME. BEHIND HIMTHE SHADOWS GATHERED IN THE FADING LIGHT. THEN I CLOSED THE DOOR BEHINDME AND WENT OUT INTO THE DARKENING STREETS.I HAD EATEN NOTHING SINCE BREAKFAST BUT I WAS NOT HUNGRY. A WRETCHEDHALFSTARVED CREATURE WHO STOOD LOOKING ACROSS THE STREET AT THE LETHALCHAMBER NOTICED ME AND CAME UP TO TELL ME A TALE OF MISERY. I GAVE HIMMONEY I DONT KNOW WHY AND HE WENT AWAY WITHOUT THANKING ME. ANHOUR LATER ANOTHER OUTCAST APPROACHED AND WHINED HIS STORY. I HAD A BLANKBIT OF PAPER IN MY POCKET ON WHICH WAS TRACED THE YELLOW SIGN AND IHANDED IT TO HIM. HE LOOKED AT IT STUPIDLY FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WITH ANUNCERTAIN GLANCE AT ME FOLDED IT WITH WHAT SEEMED TO ME EXAGGERATED CAREAND PLACED IT IN HIS BOSOM.THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS WERE SPARKLING AMONG THE TREES AND THE NEW MOONSHONE IN THE SKY ABOVE THE LETHAL CHAMBER. IT WAS TIRESOME WAITING IN THESQUARE I WANDERED FROM THE MARBLE ARCH TO THE ARTILLERY STABLES AND BACKAGAIN TO THE LOTOS FOUNTAIN. THE FLOWERS AND GRASS EXHALED A FRAGRANCEWHICH TROUBLED ME. THE JET OF THE FOUNTAIN PLAYED IN THE MOONLIGHT ANDTHE MUSICAL SPLASH OF FALLING DROPS REMINDED ME OF THE TINKLE OF CHAINEDMAIL IN HAWBERKS SHOP. BUT IT WAS NOT SO FASCINATING AND THE DULLSPARKLE OF THE MOONLIGHT ON THE WATER BROUGHT NO SUCH SENSATIONS OFEXQUISITE PLEASURE AS WHEN THE SUNSHINE PLAYED OVER THE POLISHED STEELOF A CORSELET ON HAWBERKS KNEE. I WATCHED THE BATS DARTING AND TURNINGABOVE THE WATER PLANTS IN THE FOUNTAIN BASIN BUT THEIR RAPID JERKYFLIGHT SET MY NERVES ON EDGE AND I WENT AWAY AGAIN TO WALK AIMLESSLY TOAND FRO AMONG THE TREES.THE ARTILLERY STABLES WERE DARK BUT IN THE CAVALRY BARRACKS THEOFFICERS WINDOWS WERE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED AND THE SALLYPORT WASCONSTANTLY FILLED WITH TROOPERS IN FATIGUE CARRYING STRAW AND HARNESSAND BASKETS FILLED WITH TIN DISHES.TWICE THE MOUNTED SENTRY AT THE GATES WAS CHANGED WHILE I WANDERED UP ANDDOWN THE ASPHALT WALK. I LOOKED AT MY WATCH. IT WAS NEARLY TIME. THELIGHTS IN THE BARRACKS WENT OUT ONE BY ONE THE BARRED GATE WAS CLOSEDAND EVERY MINUTE OR TWO AN OFFICER PASSED IN THROUGH THE SIDE WICKETLEAVING A RATTLE OF ACCOUTREMENTS AND A JINGLE OF SPURS ON THE NIGHT AIR.THE SQUARE HAD BECOME VERY SILENT. THE LAST HOMELESS LOITERER HAD BEENDRIVEN AWAY BY THE GREYCOATED PARK POLICEMAN THE CAR TRACKS ALONGWOOSTER STREET WERE DESERTED AND THE ONLY SOUND WHICH BROKE THESTILLNESS WAS THE STAMPING OF THE SENTRYS HORSE AND THE RING OF HISSABRE AGAINST THE SADDLE POMMEL. IN THE BARRACKS THE OFFICERS QUARTERSWERE STILL LIGHTED AND MILITARY SERVANTS PASSED AND REPASSED BEFORE THEBAY WINDOWS. TWELVE OCLOCK SOUNDED FROM THE NEW SPIRE OF ST. FRANCISXAVIER AND AT THE LAST STROKE OF THE SADTONED BELL A FIGURE PASSEDTHROUGH THE WICKET BESIDE THE PORTCULLIS RETURNED THE SALUTE OF THESENTRY AND CROSSING THE STREET ENTERED THE SQUARE AND ADVANCED TOWARDTHE BENEDICK APARTMENT HOUSE.LOUIS I CALLED.THE MAN PIVOTED ON HIS SPURRED HEELS AND CAME STRAIGHT TOWARD ME.IS THAT YOU HILDREDYES YOU ARE ON TIME.I TOOK HIS OFFERED HAND AND WE STROLLED TOWARD THE LETHAL CHAMBER.HE RATTLED ON ABOUT HIS WEDDING AND THE GRACES OF CONSTANCE AND THEIRFUTURE PROSPECTS CALLING MY ATTENTION TO HIS CAPTAINS SHOULDERSTRAPSAND THE TRIPLE GOLD ARABESQUE ON HIS SLEEVE AND FATIGUE CAP. I BELIEVE ILISTENED AS MUCH TO THE MUSIC OF HIS SPURS AND SABRE AS I DID TO HISBOYISH BABBLE AND AT LAST WE STOOD UNDER THE ELMS ON THE FOURTH STREETCORNER OF THE SQUARE OPPOSITE THE LETHAL CHAMBER. THEN HE LAUGHED ANDASKED ME WHAT I WANTED WITH HIM. I MOTIONED HIM TO A SEAT ON A BENCHUNDER THE ELECTRIC LIGHT AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM. HE LOOKED AT MECURIOUSLY WITH THAT SAME SEARCHING GLANCE WHICH I HATE AND FEAR SO INDOCTORS. I FELT THE INSULT OF HIS LOOK BUT HE DID NOT KNOW IT AND ICAREFULLY CONCEALED MY FEELINGS.WELL OLD CHAP HE INQUIRED WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOUI DREW FROM MY POCKET THE MANUSCRIPT AND NOTES OF THE IMPERIAL DYNASTYOF AMERICA AND LOOKING HIM IN THE EYE SAIDI WILL TELL YOU. ON YOUR WORD AS A SOLDIER PROMISE ME TO READ THISMANUSCRIPT FROM BEGINNING TO END WITHOUT ASKING ME A QUESTION. PROMISEME TO READ THESE NOTES IN THE SAME WAY AND PROMISE ME TO LISTEN TO WHATI HAVE TO TELL LATER.I PROMISE IF YOU WISH IT HE SAID PLEASANTLY. GIVE ME THE PAPERHILDRED.HE BEGAN TO READ RAISING HIS EYEBROWS WITH A PUZZLED WHIMSICAL AIRWHICH MADE ME TREMBLE WITH SUPPRESSED ANGER. AS HE ADVANCED HIS EYEBROWSCONTRACTED AND HIS LIPS SEEMED TO FORM THE WORD RUBBISH.THEN HE LOOKED SLIGHTLY BORED BUT APPARENTLY FOR MY SAKE READ WITH ANATTEMPT AT INTEREST WHICH PRESENTLY CEASED TO BE AN EFFORT HE STARTEDWHEN IN THE CLOSELY WRITTEN PAGES HE CAME TO HIS OWN NAME AND WHEN HECAME TO MINE HE LOWERED THE PAPER AND LOOKED SHARPLY AT ME FOR A MOMENTBUT HE KEPT HIS WORD AND RESUMED HIS READING AND I LET THE HALFFORMEDQUESTION DIE ON HIS LIPS UNANSWERED. WHEN HE CAME TO THE END AND READ THESIGNATURE OF MR. WILDE HE FOLDED THE PAPER CAREFULLY AND RETURNED IT TOME. I HANDED HIM THE NOTES AND HE SETTLED BACK PUSHING HIS FATIGUE CAPUP TO HIS FOREHEAD WITH A BOYISH GESTURE WHICH I REMEMBERED SO WELL INSCHOOL. I WATCHED HIS FACE AS HE READ AND WHEN HE FINISHED I TOOK THENOTES WITH THE MANUSCRIPT AND PLACED THEM IN MY POCKET. THEN I UNFOLDEDA SCROLL MARKED WITH THE YELLOW SIGN. HE SAW THE SIGN BUT HE DID NOTSEEM TO RECOGNIZE IT AND I CALLED HIS ATTENTION TO IT SOMEWHAT SHARPLY.WELL HE SAID I SEE IT. WHAT IS ITIT IS THE YELLOW SIGN I SAID ANGRILY.OH THATS IT IS IT SAID LOUIS IN THAT FLATTERING VOICE WHICHDOCTOR ARCHER USED TO EMPLOY WITH ME AND WOULD PROBABLY HAVE EMPLOYEDAGAIN HAD I NOT SETTLED HIS AFFAIR FOR HIM.I KEPT MY RAGE DOWN AND ANSWERED AS STEADILY AS POSSIBLE LISTEN YOUHAVE ENGAGED YOUR WORDI AM LISTENING OLD CHAP HE REPLIED SOOTHINGLY.I BEGAN TO SPEAK VERY CALMLY.DR. ARCHER HAVING BY SOME MEANS BECOME POSSESSED OF THE SECRET OF THEIMPERIAL SUCCESSION ATTEMPTED TO DEPRIVE ME OF MY RIGHT ALLEGING THATBECAUSE OF A FALL FROM MY HORSE FOUR YEARS AGO I HAD BECOME MENTALLYDEFICIENT. HE PRESUMED TO PLACE ME UNDER RESTRAINT IN HIS OWN HOUSE INHOPES OF EITHER DRIVING ME INSANE OR POISONING ME. I HAVE NOT FORGOTTENIT. I VISITED HIM LAST NIGHT AND THE INTERVIEW WAS FINAL.LOUIS TURNED QUITE PALE BUT DID NOT MOVE. I RESUMED TRIUMPHANTLY THEREARE YET THREE PEOPLE TO BE INTERVIEWED IN THE INTERESTS OF MR. WILDE ANDMYSELF. THEY ARE MY COUSIN LOUIS MR. HAWBERK AND HIS DAUGHTERCONSTANCE.LOUIS SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND I AROSE ALSO AND FLUNG THE PAPER MARKEDWITH THE YELLOW SIGN TO THE GROUND.OH I DONT NEED THAT TO TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE TO SAY I CRIED WITH ALAUGH OF TRIUMPH. YOU MUST RENOUNCE THE CROWN TO ME DO YOU HEAR TOME.LOUIS LOOKED AT ME WITH A STARTLED AIR BUT RECOVERING HIMSELF SAIDKINDLY OF COURSE I RENOUNCE THEWHAT IS IT I MUST RENOUNCETHE CROWN I SAID ANGRILY.OF COURSE HE ANSWERED I RENOUNCE IT. COME OLD CHAP ILL WALK BACKTO YOUR ROOMS WITH YOU.DONT TRY ANY OF YOUR DOCTORS TRICKS ON ME I CRIED TREMBLING WITHFURY. DONT ACT AS IF YOU THINK I AM INSANE.WHAT NONSENSE HE REPLIED. COME ITS GETTING LATE HILDRED.NO I SHOUTED YOU MUST LISTEN. YOU CANNOT MARRY I FORBID IT. DO YOUHEAR I FORBID IT. YOU SHALL RENOUNCE THE CROWN AND IN REWARD I GRANTYOU EXILE BUT IF YOU REFUSE YOU SHALL DIE.HE TRIED TO CALM ME BUT I WAS ROUSED AT LAST AND DRAWING MY LONG KNIFEBARRED HIS WAY.THEN I TOLD HIM HOW THEY WOULD FIND DR. ARCHER IN THE CELLAR WITH HISTHROAT OPEN AND I LAUGHED IN HIS FACE WHEN I THOUGHT OF VANCE AND HISKNIFE AND THE ORDER SIGNED BY ME.AH YOU ARE THE KING I CRIED BUT I SHALL BE KING. WHO ARE YOU TOKEEP ME FROM EMPIRE OVER ALL THE HABITABLE EARTH I WAS BORN THE COUSINOF A KING BUT I SHALL BE KINGLOUIS STOOD WHITE AND RIGID BEFORE ME. SUDDENLY A MAN CAME RUNNING UPFOURTH STREET ENTERED THE GATE OF THE LETHAL TEMPLE TRAVERSED THE PATHTO THE BRONZE DOORS AT FULL SPEED AND PLUNGED INTO THE DEATH CHAMBERWITH THE CRY OF ONE DEMENTED AND I LAUGHED UNTIL I WEPT TEARS FOR I HADRECOGNIZED VANCE AND KNEW THAT HAWBERK AND HIS DAUGHTER WERE NO LONGERIN MY WAY.GO I CRIED TO LOUIS YOU HAVE CEASED TO BE A MENACE. YOU WILL NEVERMARRY CONSTANCE NOW AND IF YOU MARRY ANY ONE ELSE IN YOUR EXILE I WILLVISIT YOU AS I DID MY DOCTOR LAST NIGHT. MR. WILDE TAKES CHARGE OF YOUTOMORROW. THEN I TURNED AND DARTED INTO SOUTH FIFTH AVENUE AND WITH ACRY OF TERROR LOUIS DROPPED HIS BELT AND SABRE AND FOLLOWED ME LIKE THEWIND. I HEARD HIM CLOSE BEHIND ME AT THE CORNER OF BLEECKER STREET AND IDASHED INTO THE DOORWAY UNDER HAWBERKS SIGN. HE CRIED HALT OR IFIRE BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT I FLEW UP THE STAIRS LEAVING HAWBERKS SHOPBELOW HE LEFT ME AND I HEARD HIM HAMMERING AND SHOUTING AT THEIR DOORAS THOUGH IT WERE POSSIBLE TO AROUSE THE DEAD.MR. WILDES DOOR WAS OPEN AND I ENTERED CRYING IT IS DONE IT IS DONELET THE NATIONS RISE AND LOOK UPON THEIR KING BUT I COULD NOT FIND MR.WILDE SO I WENT TO THE CABINET AND TOOK THE SPLENDID DIADEM FROM ITSCASE. THEN I DREW ON THE WHITE SILK ROBE EMBROIDERED WITH THE YELLOWSIGN AND PLACED THE CROWN UPON MY HEAD. AT LAST I WAS KING KING BY MYRIGHT IN HASTUR KING BECAUSE I KNEW THE MYSTERY OF THE HYADES AND MYMIND HAD SOUNDED THE DEPTHS OF THE LAKE OF HALI. I WAS KING THE FIRSTGREY PENCILLINGS OF DAWN WOULD RAISE A TEMPEST WHICH WOULD SHAKE TWOHEMISPHERES. THEN AS I STOOD MY EVERY NERVE PITCHED TO THE HIGHESTTENSION FAINT WITH THE JOY AND SPLENDOUR OF MY THOUGHT WITHOUT IN THEDARK PASSAGE A MAN GROANED.I SEIZED THE TALLOW DIP AND SPRANG TO THE DOOR. THE CAT PASSED ME LIKE ADEMON AND THE TALLOW DIP WENT OUT BUT MY LONG KNIFE FLEW SWIFTER THANSHE AND I HEARD HER SCREECH AND I KNEW THAT MY KNIFE HAD FOUND HER. FORA MOMENT I LISTENED TO HER TUMBLING AND THUMPING ABOUT IN THE DARKNESSAND THEN WHEN HER FRENZY CEASED I LIGHTED A LAMP AND RAISED IT OVER MYHEAD. MR. WILDE LAY ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS THROAT TORN OPEN. AT FIRST ITHOUGHT HE WAS DEAD BUT AS I LOOKED A GREEN SPARKLE CAME INTO HISSUNKEN EYES HIS MUTILATED HAND TREMBLED AND THEN A SPASM STRETCHED HISMOUTH FROM EAR TO EAR. FOR A MOMENT MY TERROR AND DESPAIR GAVE PLACE TOHOPE BUT AS I BENT OVER HIM HIS EYEBALLS ROLLED CLEAN AROUND IN HISHEAD AND HE DIED. THEN WHILE I STOOD TRANSFIXED WITH RAGE AND DESPAIRSEEING MY CROWN MY EMPIRE EVERY HOPE AND EVERY AMBITION MY VERY LIFELYING PROSTRATE THERE WITH THE DEAD MASTER THEY CAME SEIZED MEFROM BEHIND AND BOUND ME UNTIL MY VEINS STOOD OUT LIKE CORDS AND MYVOICE FAILED WITH THE PAROXYSMS OF MY FRENZIED SCREAMS. BUT I STILLRAGED BLEEDING AND INFURIATED AMONG THEM AND MORE THAN ONE POLICEMANFELT MY SHARP TEETH. THEN WHEN I COULD NO LONGER MOVE THEY CAME NEARER ISAW OLD HAWBERK AND BEHIND HIM MY COUSIN LOUIS GHASTLY FACE ANDFARTHER AWAY IN THE CORNER A WOMAN CONSTANCE WEEPING SOFTLY.AH I SEE IT NOW I SHRIEKED. YOU HAVE SEIZED THE THRONE AND THEEMPIRE. WOE WOE TO YOU WHO ARE CROWNED WITH THE CROWN OF THE KING INYELLOWEDITORS NOTE.MR. CASTAIGNE DIED YESTERDAY IN THE ASYLUM FOR CRIMINALINSANE.THE MASKCAMILLA YOU SIR SHOULD UNMASK.STRANGER INDEEDCASSILDA INDEED ITS TIME. WE ALL HAVE LAID ASIDE DISGUISE BUT YOU.STRANGER I WEAR NO MASK.CAMILLA TERRIFIED ASIDE TO CASSILDA. NO MASK NO MASKTHE KING IN YELLOW ACT I SCENE .IALTHOUGH I KNEW NOTHING OF CHEMISTRY I LISTENED FASCINATED. HE PICKED UPAN EASTER LILY WHICH GENEVIVE HAD BROUGHT THAT MORNING FROM NOTRE DAMEAND DROPPED IT INTO THE BASIN. INSTANTLY THE LIQUID LOST ITS CRYSTALLINECLEARNESS. FOR A SECOND THE LILY WAS ENVELOPED IN A MILKWHITE FOAMWHICH DISAPPEARED LEAVING THE FLUID OPALESCENT. CHANGING TINTS OF ORANGEAND CRIMSON PLAYED OVER THE SURFACE AND THEN WHAT SEEMED TO BE A RAY OFPURE SUNLIGHT STRUCK THROUGH FROM THE BOTTOM WHERE THE LILY WAS RESTING.AT THE SAME INSTANT HE PLUNGED HIS HAND INTO THE BASIN AND DREW OUT THEFLOWER. THERE IS NO DANGER HE EXPLAINED IF YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHTMOMENT. THAT GOLDEN RAY IS THE SIGNAL.HE HELD THE LILY TOWARD ME AND I TOOK IT IN MY HAND. IT HAD TURNED TOSTONE TO THE PUREST MARBLE.YOU SEE HE SAID IT IS WITHOUT A FLAW. WHAT SCULPTOR COULD REPRODUCEITTHE MARBLE WAS WHITE AS SNOW BUT IN ITS DEPTHS THE VEINS OF THE LILYWERE TINGED WITH PALEST AZURE AND A FAINT FLUSH LINGERED DEEP IN ITSHEART.DONT ASK ME THE REASON OF THAT HE SMILED NOTICING MY WONDER. I HAVENO IDEA WHY THE VEINS AND HEART ARE TINTED BUT THEY ALWAYS ARE.YESTERDAY I TRIED ONE OF GENEVIVES GOLDFISHTHERE IT IS.THE FISH LOOKED AS IF SCULPTURED IN MARBLE. BUT IF YOU HELD IT TO THELIGHT THE STONE WAS BEAUTIFULLY VEINED WITH A FAINT BLUE AND FROMSOMEWHERE WITHIN CAME A ROSY LIGHT LIKE THE TINT WHICH SLUMBERS IN ANOPAL. I LOOKED INTO THE BASIN. ONCE MORE IT SEEMED FILLED WITH CLEARESTCRYSTAL.IF I SHOULD TOUCH IT NOW I DEMANDED.I DONT KNOW HE REPLIED BUT YOU HAD BETTER NOT TRY.THERE IS ONE THING IM CURIOUS ABOUT I SAID AND THAT IS WHERE THERAY OF SUNLIGHT CAME FROM.IT LOOKED LIKE A SUNBEAM TRUE ENOUGH HE SAID. I DONT KNOW IT ALWAYSCOMES WHEN I IMMERSE ANY LIVING THING. PERHAPS HE CONTINUED SMILINGPERHAPS IT IS THE VITAL SPARK OF THE CREATURE ESCAPING TO THE SOURCEFROM WHENCE IT CAME.I SAW HE WAS MOCKING AND THREATENED HIM WITH A MAHLSTICK BUT HE ONLYLAUGHED AND CHANGED THE SUBJECT.STAY TO LUNCH. GENEVIVE WILL BE HERE DIRECTLY.I SAW HER GOING TO EARLY MASS I SAID AND SHE LOOKED AS FRESH ANDSWEET AS THAT LILYBEFORE YOU DESTROYED IT.DO YOU THINK I DESTROYED IT SAID BORIS GRAVELY.DESTROYED PRESERVED HOW CAN WE TELLWE SAT IN THE CORNER OF A STUDIO NEAR HIS UNFINISHED GROUP OF THEFATES. HE LEANED BACK ON THE SOFA TWIRLING A SCULPTORS CHISEL ANDSQUINTING AT HIS WORK.BY THE WAY HE SAID I HAVE FINISHED POINTING UP THAT OLD ACADEMICARIADNE AND I SUPPOSE IT WILL HAVE TO GO TO THE SALON. ITS ALL I HAVEREADY THIS YEAR BUT AFTER THE SUCCESS THE MADONNA BROUGHT ME I FEELASHAMED TO SEND A THING LIKE THAT.THE MADONNA AN EXQUISITE MARBLE FOR WHICH GENEVIVE HAD SAT HAD BEENTHE SENSATION OF LAST YEARS SALON. I LOOKED AT THE ARIADNE. IT WAS AMAGNIFICENT PIECE OF TECHNICAL WORK BUT I AGREED WITH BORIS THAT THEWORLD WOULD EXPECT SOMETHING BETTER OF HIM THAN THAT. STILL IT WASIMPOSSIBLE NOW TO THINK OF FINISHING IN TIME FOR THE SALON THAT SPLENDIDTERRIBLE GROUP HALF SHROUDED IN THE MARBLE BEHIND ME. THE FATES WOULDHAVE TO WAIT.WE WERE PROUD OF BORIS YVAIN. WE CLAIMED HIM AND HE CLAIMED US ON THESTRENGTH OF HIS HAVING BEEN BORN IN AMERICA ALTHOUGH HIS FATHER WASFRENCH AND HIS MOTHER WAS A RUSSIAN. EVERY ONE IN THE BEAUX ARTS CALLEDHIM BORIS. AND YET THERE WERE ONLY TWO OF US WHOM HE ADDRESSED IN THESAME FAMILIAR WAYJACK SCOTT AND MYSELF.PERHAPS MY BEING IN LOVE WITH GENEVIVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HISAFFECTION FOR ME. NOT THAT IT HAD EVER BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BETWEEN US. BUTAFTER ALL WAS SETTLED AND SHE HAD TOLD ME WITH TEARS IN HER EYES THAT ITWAS BORIS WHOM SHE LOVED I WENT OVER TO HIS HOUSE AND CONGRATULATED HIM.THE PERFECT CORDIALITY OF THAT INTERVIEW DID NOT DECEIVE EITHER OF US IALWAYS BELIEVED ALTHOUGH TO ONE AT LEAST IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT. I DONOT THINK HE AND GENEVIVE EVER SPOKE OF THE MATTER TOGETHER BUT BORISKNEW.GENEVIVE WAS LOVELY. THE MADONNALIKE PURITY OF HER FACE MIGHT HAVE BEENINSPIRED BY THE SANCTUS IN GOUNODS MASS. BUT I WAS ALWAYS GLAD WHEN SHECHANGED THAT MOOD FOR WHAT WE CALLED HER APRIL MANOEUVRES. SHE WASOFTEN AS VARIABLE AS AN APRIL DAY. IN THE MORNING GRAVE DIGNIFIED ANDSWEET AT NOON LAUGHING CAPRICIOUS AT EVENING WHATEVER ONE LEASTEXPECTED. I PREFERRED HER SO RATHER THAN IN THAT MADONNALIKETRANQUILLITY WHICH STIRRED THE DEPTHS OF MY HEART. I WAS DREAMING OFGENEVIVE WHEN HE SPOKE AGAIN.WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY DISCOVERY ALECI THINK IT WONDERFUL.I SHALL MAKE NO USE OF IT YOU KNOW BEYOND SATISFYING MY OWN CURIOSITYSO FAR AS MAY BE AND THE SECRET WILL DIE WITH ME.IT WOULD BE RATHER A BLOW TO SCULPTURE WOULD IT NOT WE PAINTERS LOSEMORE THAN WE EVER GAIN BY PHOTOGRAPHY.BORIS NODDED PLAYING WITH THE EDGE OF THE CHISEL.THIS NEW VICIOUS DISCOVERY WOULD CORRUPT THE WORLD OF ART. NO I SHALLNEVER CONFIDE THE SECRET TO ANY ONE HE SAID SLOWLY.IT WOULD BE HARD TO FIND ANY ONE LESS INFORMED ABOUT SUCH PHENOMENA THANMYSELF BUT OF COURSE I HAD HEARD OF MINERAL SPRINGS SO SATURATED WITHSILICA THAT THE LEAVES AND TWIGS WHICH FELL INTO THEM WERE TURNED TOSTONE AFTER A TIME. I DIMLY COMPREHENDED THE PROCESS HOW THE SILICAREPLACED THE VEGETABLE MATTER ATOM BY ATOM AND THE RESULT WAS ADUPLICATE OF THE OBJECT IN STONE. THIS I CONFESS HAD NEVER INTERESTEDME GREATLY AND AS FOR THE ANCIENT FOSSILS THUS PRODUCED THEY DISGUSTEDME. BORIS IT APPEARED FEELING CURIOSITY INSTEAD OF REPUGNANCE HADINVESTIGATED THE SUBJECT AND HAD ACCIDENTALLY STUMBLED ON A SOLUTIONWHICH ATTACKING THE IMMERSED OBJECT WITH A FEROCITY UNHEARD OF IN ASECOND DID THE WORK OF YEARS. THIS WAS ALL I COULD MAKE OUT OF THESTRANGE STORY HE HAD JUST BEEN TELLING ME. HE SPOKE AGAIN AFTER A LONGSILENCE.I AM ALMOST FRIGHTENED WHEN I THINK WHAT I HAVE FOUND. SCIENTISTS WOULDGO MAD OVER THE DISCOVERY. IT WAS SO SIMPLE TOO IT DISCOVERED ITSELF.WHEN I THINK OF THAT FORMULA AND THAT NEW ELEMENT PRECIPITATED INMETALLIC SCALESWHAT NEW ELEMENTOH I HAVENT THOUGHT OF NAMING IT AND I DONT BELIEVE I EVER SHALL.THERE ARE ENOUGH PRECIOUS METALS NOW IN THE WORLD TO CUT THROATS OVER.I PRICKED UP MY EARS. HAVE YOU STRUCK GOLD BORISNO BETTERBUT SEE HERE ALEC HE LAUGHED STARTING UP. YOU AND IHAVE ALL WE NEED IN THIS WORLD. AH HOW SINISTER AND COVETOUS YOU LOOKALREADY I LAUGHED TOO AND TOLD HIM I WAS DEVOURED BY THE DESIRE FORGOLD AND WE HAD BETTER TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE SO WHEN GENEVIVE CAME INSHORTLY AFTER WE HAD TURNED OUR BACKS ON ALCHEMY.GENEVIVE WAS DRESSED IN SILVERY GREY FROM HEAD TO FOOT. THE LIGHTGLINTED ALONG THE SOFT CURVES OF HER FAIR HAIR AS SHE TURNED HER CHEEK TOBORIS THEN SHE SAW ME AND RETURNED MY GREETING. SHE HAD NEVER BEFOREFAILED TO BLOW ME A KISS FROM THE TIPS OF HER WHITE FINGERS AND IPROMPTLY COMPLAINED OF THE OMISSION. SHE SMILED AND HELD OUT HER HANDWHICH DROPPED ALMOST BEFORE IT HAD TOUCHED MINE THEN SHE SAID LOOKINGAT BORISYOU MUST ASK ALEC TO STAY FOR LUNCHEON. THIS ALSO WAS SOMETHING NEW.SHE HAD ALWAYS ASKED ME HERSELF UNTIL TODAY.I DID SAID BORIS SHORTLY.AND YOU SAID YES I HOPE SHE TURNED TO ME WITH A CHARMING CONVENTIONALSMILE. I MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN ACQUAINTANCE OF THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY. IMADE HER A LOW BOW. JAVAIS BIEN LHONNEUR MADAME BUT REFUSING TOTAKE UP OUR USUAL BANTERING TONE SHE MURMURED A HOSPITABLE COMMONPLACEAND DISAPPEARED. BORIS AND I LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER.I HAD BETTER GO HOME DONT YOU THINK I ASKED.HANGED IF I KNOW HE REPLIED FRANKLY.WHILE WE WERE DISCUSSING THE ADVISABILITY OF MY DEPARTURE GENEVIVEREAPPEARED IN THE DOORWAY WITHOUT HER BONNET. SHE WAS WONDERFULLYBEAUTIFUL BUT HER COLOUR WAS TOO DEEP AND HER LOVELY EYES WERE TOOBRIGHT. SHE CAME STRAIGHT UP TO ME AND TOOK MY ARM.LUNCHEON IS READY. WAS I CROSS ALEC I THOUGHT I HAD A HEADACHE BUT IHAVENT. COME HERE BORIS AND SHE SLIPPED HER OTHER ARM THROUGH HIS.ALEC KNOWS THAT AFTER YOU THERE IS NO ONE IN THE WORLD WHOM I LIKE ASWELL AS I LIKE HIM SO IF HE SOMETIMES FEELS SNUBBED IT WONT HURT HIM. LA BONHEUR I CRIED WHO SAYS THERE ARE NO THUNDERSTORMS IN APRILARE YOU READY CHANTED BORIS. AYE READY AND ARMINARM WE RACED INTOTHE DININGROOM SCANDALIZING THE SERVANTS. AFTER ALL WE WERE NOT SO MUCHTO BLAME GENEVIVE WAS EIGHTEEN BORIS WAS TWENTYTHREE AND I NOT QUITETWENTYONE.IISOME WORK THAT I WAS DOING ABOUT THIS TIME ON THE DECORATIONS FORGENEVIVES BOUDOIR KEPT ME CONSTANTLY AT THE QUAINT LITTLE HOTEL IN THERUE SAINTECCILE. BORIS AND I IN THOSE DAYS LABOURED HARD BUT AS WEPLEASED WHICH WAS FITFULLY AND WE ALL THREE WITH JACK SCOTT IDLED AGREAT DEAL TOGETHER.ONE QUIET AFTERNOON I HAD BEEN WANDERING ALONE OVER THE HOUSE EXAMININGCURIOS PRYING INTO ODD CORNERS BRINGING OUT SWEETMEATS AND CIGARS FROMSTRANGE HIDINGPLACES AND AT LAST I STOPPED IN THE BATHINGROOM. BORISALL OVER CLAY STOOD THERE WASHING HIS HANDS.THE ROOM WAS BUILT OF ROSECOLOURED MARBLE EXCEPTING THE FLOOR WHICH WASTESSELLATED IN ROSE AND GREY. IN THE CENTRE WAS A SQUARE POOL SUNKENBELOW THE SURFACE OF THE FLOOR STEPS LED DOWN INTO IT SCULPTUREDPILLARS SUPPORTED A FRESCOED CEILING. A DELICIOUS MARBLE CUPID APPEAREDTO HAVE JUST ALIGHTED ON HIS PEDESTAL AT THE UPPER END OF THE ROOM. THEWHOLE INTERIOR WAS BORIS WORK AND MINE. BORIS IN HIS WORKINGCLOTHES OFWHITE CANVAS SCRAPED THE TRACES OF CLAY AND RED MODELLING WAX FROM HISHANDSOME HANDS AND COQUETTED OVER HIS SHOULDER WITH THE CUPID.I SEE YOU HE INSISTED DONT TRY TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY AND PRETENDNOT TO SEE ME. YOU KNOW WHO MADE YOU LITTLE HUMBUGIT WAS ALWAYS MY RLE TO INTERPRET CUPIDS SENTIMENTS IN THESECONVERSATIONS AND WHEN MY TURN CAME I RESPONDED IN SUCH A MANNER THATBORIS SEIZED MY ARM AND DRAGGED ME TOWARD THE POOL DECLARING HE WOULDDUCK ME. NEXT INSTANT HE DROPPED MY ARM AND TURNED PALE. GOOD GOD HESAID I FORGOT THE POOL IS FULL OF THE SOLUTIONI SHIVERED A LITTLE AND DRYLY ADVISED HIM TO REMEMBER BETTER WHERE HEHAD STORED THE PRECIOUS LIQUID.IN HEAVENS NAME WHY DO YOU KEEP A SMALL LAKE OF THAT GRUESOME STUFFHERE OF ALL PLACES I ASKED.I WANT TO EXPERIMENT ON SOMETHING LARGE HE REPLIED.ON ME FOR INSTANCEAH THAT CAME TOO CLOSE FOR JESTING BUT I DO WANT TO WATCH THE ACTIONOF THAT SOLUTION ON A MORE HIGHLY ORGANIZED LIVING BODY THERE IS THATBIG WHITE RABBIT HE SAID FOLLOWING ME INTO THE STUDIO.JACK SCOTT WEARING A PAINTSTAINED JACKET CAME WANDERING INAPPROPRIATED ALL THE ORIENTAL SWEETMEATS HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ONLOOTED THE CIGARETTE CASE AND FINALLY HE AND BORIS DISAPPEARED TOGETHERTO VISIT THE LUXEMBOURG GALLERY WHERE A NEW SILVER BRONZE BY RODIN AND ALANDSCAPE OF MONETS WERE CLAIMING THE EXCLUSIVE ATTENTION OF ARTISTICFRANCE. I WENT BACK TO THE STUDIO AND RESUMED MY WORK. IT WAS ARENAISSANCE SCREEN WHICH BORIS WANTED ME TO PAINT FOR GENEVIVESBOUDOIR. BUT THE SMALL BOY WHO WAS UNWILLINGLY DAWDLING THROUGH A SERIESOF POSES FOR IT TODAY REFUSED ALL BRIBES TO BE GOOD. HE NEVER RESTED ANINSTANT IN THE SAME POSITION AND INSIDE OF FIVE MINUTES I HAD AS MANYDIFFERENT OUTLINES OF THE LITTLE BEGGAR.ARE YOU POSING OR ARE YOU EXECUTING A SONG AND DANCE MY FRIEND IINQUIRED.WHICHEVER MONSIEUR PLEASES HE REPLIED WITH AN ANGELIC SMILE.OF COURSE I DISMISSED HIM FOR THE DAY AND OF COURSE I PAID HIM FOR THEFULL TIME THAT BEING THE WAY WE SPOIL OUR MODELS.AFTER THE YOUNG IMP HAD GONE I MADE A FEW PERFUNCTORY DAUBS AT MY WORKBUT WAS SO THOROUGHLY OUT OF HUMOUR THAT IT TOOK ME THE REST OF THEAFTERNOON TO UNDO THE DAMAGE I HAD DONE SO AT LAST I SCRAPED MY PALETTESTUCK MY BRUSHES IN A BOWL OF BLACK SOAP AND STROLLED INTO THESMOKINGROOM. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT EXCEPTING GENEVIVES APARTMENTS NOROOM IN THE HOUSE WAS SO FREE FROM THE PERFUME OF TOBACCO AS THIS ONE. ITWAS A QUEER CHAOS OF ODDS AND ENDS HUNG WITH THREADBARE TAPESTRY. ASWEETTONED OLD SPINET IN GOOD REPAIR STOOD BY THE WINDOW. THERE WERESTANDS OF WEAPONS SOME OLD AND DULL OTHERS BRIGHT AND MODERN FESTOONSOF INDIAN AND TURKISH ARMOUR OVER THE MANTEL TWO OR THREE GOOD PICTURESAND A PIPERACK. IT WAS HERE THAT WE USED TO COME FOR NEW SENSATIONS INSMOKING. I DOUBT IF ANY TYPE OF PIPE EVER EXISTED WHICH WAS NOTREPRESENTED IN THAT RACK. WHEN WE HAD SELECTED ONE WE IMMEDIATELYCARRIED IT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND SMOKED IT FOR THE PLACE WAS ON THE WHOLEMORE GLOOMY AND LESS INVITING THAN ANY IN THE HOUSE. BUT THIS AFTERNOONTHE TWILIGHT WAS VERY SOOTHING THE RUGS AND SKINS ON THE FLOOR LOOKEDBROWN AND SOFT AND DROWSY THE BIG COUCH WAS PILED WITH CUSHIONSI FOUNDMY PIPE AND CURLED UP THERE FOR AN UNACCUSTOMED SMOKE IN THESMOKINGROOM. I HAD CHOSEN ONE WITH A LONG FLEXIBLE STEM AND LIGHTING ITFELL TO DREAMING. AFTER A WHILE IT WENT OUT BUT I DID NOT STIR. IDREAMED ON AND PRESENTLY FELL ASLEEP.I AWOKE TO THE SADDEST MUSIC I HAD EVER HEARD. THE ROOM WAS QUITE DARK IHAD NO IDEA WHAT TIME IT WAS. A RAY OF MOONLIGHT SILVERED ONE EDGE OF THEOLD SPINET AND THE POLISHED WOOD SEEMED TO EXHALE THE SOUNDS AS PERFUMEFLOATS ABOVE A BOX OF SANDALWOOD. SOME ONE ROSE IN THE DARKNESS AND CAMEAWAY WEEPING QUIETLY AND I WAS FOOL ENOUGH TO CRY OUT GENEVIVESHE DROPPED AT MY VOICE AND I HAD TIME TO CURSE MYSELF WHILE I MADE ALIGHT AND TRIED TO RAISE HER FROM THE FLOOR. SHE SHRANK AWAY WITH AMURMUR OF PAIN. SHE WAS VERY QUIET AND ASKED FOR BORIS. I CARRIED HER TOTHE DIVAN AND WENT TO LOOK FOR HIM BUT HE WAS NOT IN THE HOUSE AND THESERVANTS WERE GONE TO BED. PERPLEXED AND ANXIOUS I HURRIED BACK TOGENEVIVE. SHE LAY WHERE I HAD LEFT HER LOOKING VERY WHITE.I CANT FIND BORIS NOR ANY OF THE SERVANTS I SAID.I KNOW SHE ANSWERED FAINTLY BORIS HAS GONE TO EPT WITH MR. SCOTT. IDID NOT REMEMBER WHEN I SENT YOU FOR HIM JUST NOW.BUT HE CANT GET BACK IN THAT CASE BEFORE TOMORROW AFTERNOON ANDAREYOU HURT DID I FRIGHTEN YOU INTO FALLING WHAT AN AWFUL FOOL I AM BUT IWAS ONLY HALF AWAKE.BORIS THOUGHT YOU HAD GONE HOME BEFORE DINNER. DO PLEASE EXCUSE US FORLETTING YOU STAY HERE ALL THIS TIME.I HAVE HAD A LONG NAP I LAUGHED SO SOUND THAT I DID NOT KNOW WHETHERI WAS STILL ASLEEP OR NOT WHEN I FOUND MYSELF STARING AT A FIGURE THATWAS MOVING TOWARD ME AND CALLED OUT YOUR NAME. HAVE YOU BEEN TRYING THEOLD SPINET YOU MUST HAVE PLAYED VERY SOFTLY.I WOULD TELL A THOUSAND MORE LIES WORSE THAN THAT ONE TO SEE THE LOOK OFRELIEF THAT CAME INTO HER FACE. SHE SMILED ADORABLY AND SAID IN HERNATURAL VOICE ALEC I TRIPPED ON THAT WOLFS HEAD AND I THINK MY ANKLEIS SPRAINED. PLEASE CALL MARIE AND THEN GO HOME.I DID AS SHE BADE ME AND LEFT HER THERE WHEN THE MAID CAME IN.IIIAT NOON NEXT DAY WHEN I CALLED I FOUND BORIS WALKING RESTLESSLY ABOUTHIS STUDIO.GENEVIVE IS ASLEEP JUST NOW HE TOLD ME THE SPRAIN IS NOTHING BUTWHY SHOULD SHE HAVE SUCH A HIGH FEVER THE DOCTOR CANT ACCOUNT FOR ITOR ELSE HE WILL NOT HE MUTTERED.GENEVIVE HAS A FEVER I ASKED.I SHOULD SAY SO AND HAS ACTUALLY BEEN A LITTLE LIGHTHEADED ATINTERVALS ALL NIGHT. THE IDEA GAY LITTLE GENEVIVE WITHOUT A CARE INTHE WORLDAND SHE KEEPS SAYING HER HEARTS BROKEN AND SHE WANTS TODIEMY OWN HEART STOOD STILL.BORIS LEANED AGAINST THE DOOR OF HIS STUDIO LOOKING DOWN HIS HANDS INHIS POCKETS HIS KIND KEEN EYES CLOUDED A NEW LINE OF TROUBLE DRAWNOVER THE MOUTHS GOOD MARK THAT MADE THE SMILE. THE MAID HAD ORDERS TOSUMMON HIM THE INSTANT GENEVIVE OPENED HER EYES. WE WAITED AND WAITEDAND BORIS GROWING RESTLESS WANDERED ABOUT FUSSING WITH MODELLING WAXAND RED CLAY. SUDDENLY HE STARTED FOR THE NEXT ROOM. COME AND SEE MYROSECOLOURED BATH FULL OF DEATH HE CRIED.IS IT DEATH I ASKED TO HUMOUR HIS MOOD.YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO CALL IT LIFE I SUPPOSE HE ANSWERED. AS HESPOKE HE PLUCKED A SOLITARY GOLDFISH SQUIRMING AND TWISTING OUT OF ITSGLOBE. WELL SEND THIS ONE AFTER THE OTHERWHEREVER THAT IS HE SAID.THERE WAS FEVERISH EXCITEMENT IN HIS VOICE. A DULL WEIGHT OF FEVER LAY ONMY LIMBS AND ON MY BRAIN AS I FOLLOWED HIM TO THE FAIR CRYSTAL POOL WITHITS PINKTINTED SIDES AND HE DROPPED THE CREATURE IN. FALLING ITSSCALES FLASHED WITH A HOT ORANGE GLEAM IN ITS ANGRY TWISTINGS ANDCONTORTIONS THE MOMENT IT STRUCK THE LIQUID IT BECAME RIGID AND SANKHEAVILY TO THE BOTTOM. THEN CAME THE MILKY FOAM THE SPLENDID HUESRADIATING ON THE SURFACE AND THEN THE SHAFT OF PURE SERENE LIGHT BROKETHROUGH FROM SEEMINGLY INFINITE DEPTHS. BORIS PLUNGED IN HIS HAND ANDDREW OUT AN EXQUISITE MARBLE THING BLUEVEINED ROSETINTED ANDGLISTENING WITH OPALESCENT DROPS.CHILDS PLAY HE MUTTERED AND LOOKED WEARILY LONGINGLY AT MEAS IFI COULD ANSWER SUCH QUESTIONS BUT JACK SCOTT CAME IN AND ENTERED INTOTHE GAME AS HE CALLED IT WITH ARDOUR. NOTHING WOULD DO BUT TO TRY THEEXPERIMENT ON THE WHITE RABBIT THEN AND THERE. I WAS WILLING THAT BORISSHOULD FIND DISTRACTION FROM HIS CARES BUT I HATED TO SEE THE LIFE GOOUT OF A WARM LIVING CREATURE AND I DECLINED TO BE PRESENT. PICKING UP ABOOK AT RANDOM I SAT DOWN IN THE STUDIO TO READ. ALAS I HAD FOUNDTHE KING IN YELLOW. AFTER A FEW MOMENTS WHICH SEEMED AGES I WASPUTTING IT AWAY WITH A NERVOUS SHUDDER WHEN BORIS AND JACK CAME INBRINGING THEIR MARBLE RABBIT. AT THE SAME TIME THE BELL RANG ABOVE AND ACRY CAME FROM THE SICKROOM. BORIS WAS GONE LIKE A FLASH AND THE NEXTMOMENT HE CALLED JACK RUN FOR THE DOCTOR BRING HIM BACK WITH YOU.ALEC COME HERE.I WENT AND STOOD AT HER DOOR. A FRIGHTENED MAID CAME OUT IN HASTE AND RANAWAY TO FETCH SOME REMEDY. GENEVIVE SITTING BOLT UPRIGHT WITH CRIMSONCHEEKS AND GLITTERING EYES BABBLED INCESSANTLY AND RESISTED BORISGENTLE RESTRAINT. HE CALLED ME TO HELP. AT MY FIRST TOUCH SHE SIGHED ANDSANK BACK CLOSING HER EYES AND THENTHENAS WE STILL BENT ABOVE HERSHE OPENED THEM AGAIN LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO BORIS FACEPOORFEVERCRAZED GIRLAND TOLD HER SECRET. AT THE SAME INSTANT OUR THREELIVES TURNED INTO NEW CHANNELS THE BOND THAT HELD US SO LONG TOGETHERSNAPPED FOR EVER AND A NEW BOND WAS FORGED IN ITS PLACE FOR SHE HADSPOKEN MY NAME AND AS THE FEVER TORTURED HER HER HEART POURED OUT ITSLOAD OF HIDDEN SORROW. AMAZED AND DUMB I BOWED MY HEAD WHILE MY FACEBURNED LIKE A LIVE COAL AND THE BLOOD SURGED IN MY EARS STUPEFYING MEWITH ITS CLAMOUR. INCAPABLE OF MOVEMENT INCAPABLE OF SPEECH I LISTENEDTO HER FEVERISH WORDS IN AN AGONY OF SHAME AND SORROW. I COULD NOTSILENCE HER I COULD NOT LOOK AT BORIS. THEN I FELT AN ARM UPON MYSHOULDER AND BORIS TURNED A BLOODLESS FACE TO MINE.IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT ALEC DONT GRIEVE SO IF SHE LOVES YOU BUT HECOULD NOT FINISH AND AS THE DOCTOR STEPPED SWIFTLY INTO THE ROOMSAYINGAH THE FEVER I SEIZED JACK SCOTT AND HURRIED HIM TO THESTREET SAYING BORIS WOULD RATHER BE ALONE. WE CROSSED THE STREET TOOUR OWN APARTMENTS AND THAT NIGHT SEEING I WAS GOING TO BE ILL TOO HEWENT FOR THE DOCTOR AGAIN. THE LAST THING I RECOLLECT WITH ANYDISTINCTNESS WAS HEARING JACK SAY FOR HEAVENS SAKE DOCTOR WHAT AILSHIM TO WEAR A FACE LIKE THAT AND I THOUGHT OF THE KING INYELLOW AND THE PALLID MASK.I WAS VERY ILL FOR THE STRAIN OF TWO YEARS WHICH I HAD ENDURED SINCETHAT FATAL MAY MORNING WHEN GENEVIVE MURMURED I LOVE YOU BUT I THINKI LOVE BORIS BEST TOLD ON ME AT LAST. I HAD NEVER IMAGINED THAT ITCOULD BECOME MORE THAN I COULD ENDURE. OUTWARDLY TRANQUIL I HAD DECEIVEDMYSELF. ALTHOUGH THE INWARD BATTLE RAGED NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AND I LYINGALONE IN MY ROOM CURSED MYSELF FOR REBELLIOUS THOUGHTS UNLOYAL TO BORISAND UNWORTHY OF GENEVIVE THE MORNING ALWAYS BROUGHT RELIEF AND IRETURNED TO GENEVIVE AND TO MY DEAR BORIS WITH A HEART WASHED CLEAN BYTHE TEMPESTS OF THE NIGHT.NEVER IN WORD OR DEED OR THOUGHT WHILE WITH THEM HAD I BETRAYED MY SORROWEVEN TO MYSELF.THE MASK OF SELFDECEPTION WAS NO LONGER A MASK FOR ME IT WAS A PART OFME. NIGHT LIFTED IT LAYING BARE THE STIFLED TRUTH BELOW BUT THERE WASNO ONE TO SEE EXCEPT MYSELF AND WHEN THE DAY BROKE THE MASK FELL BACKAGAIN OF ITS OWN ACCORD. THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MY TROUBLED MINDAS I LAY SICK BUT THEY WERE HOPELESSLY ENTANGLED WITH VISIONS OF WHITECREATURES HEAVY AS STONE CRAWLING ABOUT IN BORIS BASINOF THE WOLFSHEAD ON THE RUG FOAMING AND SNAPPING AT GENEVIVE WHO LAY SMILINGBESIDE IT. I THOUGHT TOO OF THE KING IN YELLOW WRAPPED IN THE FANTASTICCOLOURS OF HIS TATTERED MANTLE AND THAT BITTER CRY OF CASSILDA NOTUPON US OH KING NOT UPON US FEVERISHLY I STRUGGLED TO PUT IT FROM MEBUT I SAW THE LAKE OF HALI THIN AND BLANK WITHOUT A RIPPLE OR WIND TOSTIR IT AND I SAW THE TOWERS OF CARCOSA BEHIND THE MOON. ALDEBARAN THEHYADES ALAR HASTUR GLIDED THROUGH THE CLOUDRIFTS WHICH FLUTTERED ANDFLAPPED AS THEY PASSED LIKE THE SCOLLOPED TATTERS OF THE KING IN YELLOW.AMONG ALL THESE ONE SANE THOUGHT PERSISTED. IT NEVER WAVERED NO MATTERWHAT ELSE WAS GOING ON IN MY DISORDERED MIND THAT MY CHIEF REASON FOREXISTING WAS TO MEET SOME REQUIREMENT OF BORIS AND GENEVIVE. WHAT THISOBLIGATION WAS ITS NATURE WAS NEVER CLEAR SOMETIMES IT SEEMED TO BEPROTECTION SOMETIMES SUPPORT THROUGH A GREAT CRISIS. WHATEVER IT SEEMEDTO BE FOR THE TIME ITS WEIGHT RESTED ONLY ON ME AND I WAS NEVER SO ILLOR SO WEAK THAT I DID NOT RESPOND WITH MY WHOLE SOUL. THERE WERE ALWAYSCROWDS OF FACES ABOUT ME MOSTLY STRANGE BUT A FEW I RECOGNIZED BORISAMONG THEM. AFTERWARD THEY TOLD ME THAT THIS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BUT IKNOW THAT ONCE AT LEAST HE BENT OVER ME. IT WAS ONLY A TOUCH A FAINTECHO OF HIS VOICE THEN THE CLOUDS SETTLED BACK ON MY SENSES AND I LOSTHIM BUT HE DID STAND THERE AND BEND OVER ME ONCE AT LEAST.AT LAST ONE MORNING I AWOKE TO FIND THE SUNLIGHT FALLING ACROSS MY BEDAND JACK SCOTT READING BESIDE ME. I HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO SPEAKALOUD NEITHER COULD I THINK MUCH LESS REMEMBER BUT I COULD SMILEFEEBLY AS JACKS EYE MET MINE AND WHEN HE JUMPED UP AND ASKED EAGERLYIF I WANTED ANYTHING I COULD WHISPER YESBORIS. JACK MOVED TO THEHEAD OF MY BED AND LEANED DOWN TO ARRANGE MY PILLOW I DID NOT SEE HISFACE BUT HE ANSWERED HEARTILY YOU MUST WAIT ALEC YOU ARE TOO WEAK TOSEE EVEN BORIS.I WAITED AND I GREW STRONG IN A FEW DAYS I WAS ABLE TO SEE WHOM I WOULDBUT MEANWHILE I HAD THOUGHT AND REMEMBERED. FROM THE MOMENT WHEN ALL THEPAST GREW CLEAR AGAIN IN MY MIND I NEVER DOUBTED WHAT I SHOULD DO WHENTHE TIME CAME AND I FELT SURE THAT BORIS WOULD HAVE RESOLVED UPON THESAME COURSE SO FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED AS FOR WHAT PERTAINED TO MEALONE I KNEW HE WOULD SEE THAT ALSO AS I DID. I NO LONGER ASKED FOR ANYONE. I NEVER INQUIRED WHY NO MESSAGE CAME FROM THEM WHY DURING THE WEEKI LAY THERE WAITING AND GROWING STRONGER I NEVER HEARD THEIR NAMESPOKEN. PREOCCUPIED WITH MY OWN SEARCHINGS FOR THE RIGHT WAY AND WITH MYFEEBLE BUT DETERMINED FIGHT AGAINST DESPAIR I SIMPLY ACQUIESCED INJACKS RETICENCE TAKING FOR GRANTED THAT HE WAS AFRAID TO SPEAK OF THEMLEST I SHOULD TURN UNRULY AND INSIST ON SEEING THEM. MEANWHILE I SAIDOVER AND OVER TO MYSELF HOW WOULD IT BE WHEN LIFE BEGAN AGAIN FOR USALL WE WOULD TAKE UP OUR RELATIONS EXACTLY AS THEY WERE BEFORE GENEVIVEFELL ILL. BORIS AND I WOULD LOOK INTO EACH OTHERS EYES AND THERE WOULDBE NEITHER RANCOUR NOR COWARDICE NOR MISTRUST IN THAT GLANCE. I WOULD BEWITH THEM AGAIN FOR A LITTLE WHILE IN THE DEAR INTIMACY OF THEIR HOMEAND THEN WITHOUT PRETEXT OR EXPLANATION I WOULD DISAPPEAR FROM THEIRLIVES FOR EVER. BORIS WOULD KNOW GENEVIVETHE ONLY COMFORT WAS THATSHE WOULD NEVER KNOW. IT SEEMED AS I THOUGHT IT OVER THAT I HAD FOUNDTHE MEANING OF THAT SENSE OF OBLIGATION WHICH HAD PERSISTED ALL THROUGHMY DELIRIUM AND THE ONLY POSSIBLE ANSWER TO IT. SO WHEN I WAS QUITEREADY I BECKONED JACK TO ME ONE DAY AND SAIDJACK I WANT BORIS AT ONCE AND TAKE MY DEAREST GREETING TOGENEVIVE....WHEN AT LAST HE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WERE BOTH DEAD I FELL INTOA WILD RAGE THAT TORE ALL MY LITTLE CONVALESCENT STRENGTH TO ATOMS. IRAVED AND CURSED MYSELF INTO A RELAPSE FROM WHICH I CRAWLED FORTH SOMEWEEKS AFTERWARD A BOY OF TWENTYONE WHO BELIEVED THAT HIS YOUTH WAS GONEFOR EVER. I SEEMED TO BE PAST THE CAPABILITY OF FURTHER SUFFERING ANDONE DAY WHEN JACK HANDED ME A LETTER AND THE KEYS TO BORIS HOUSE I TOOKTHEM WITHOUT A TREMOR AND ASKED HIM TO TELL ME ALL. IT WAS CRUEL OF ME TOASK HIM BUT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT AND HE LEANED WEARILY ON HIS THINHANDS TO REOPEN THE WOUND WHICH COULD NEVER ENTIRELY HEAL. HE BEGAN VERYQUIETLYALEC UNLESS YOU HAVE A CLUE THAT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT YOU WILL NOT BEABLE TO EXPLAIN ANY MORE THAN I WHAT HAS HAPPENED. I SUSPECT THAT YOUWOULD RATHER NOT HEAR THESE DETAILS BUT YOU MUST LEARN THEM ELSE IWOULD SPARE YOU THE RELATION. GOD KNOWS I WISH I COULD BE SPARED THETELLING. I SHALL USE FEW WORDS.THAT DAY WHEN I LEFT YOU IN THE DOCTORS CARE AND CAME BACK TO BORIS IFOUND HIM WORKING ON THE FATES. GENEVIVE HE SAID WAS SLEEPING UNDERTHE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS. SHE HAD BEEN QUITE OUT OF HER MIND HE SAID. HEKEPT ON WORKING NOT TALKING ANY MORE AND I WATCHED HIM. BEFORE LONG ISAW THAT THE THIRD FIGURE OF THE GROUPTHE ONE LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEADOUT OVER THE WORLDBORE HIS FACE NOT AS YOU EVER SAW IT BUT AS ITLOOKED THEN AND TO THE END. THIS IS ONE THING FOR WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TOFIND AN EXPLANATION BUT I NEVER SHALL.WELL HE WORKED AND I WATCHED HIM IN SILENCE AND WE WENT ON THAT WAYUNTIL NEARLY MIDNIGHT. THEN WE HEARD THE DOOR OPEN AND SHUT SHARPLY ANDA SWIFT RUSH IN THE NEXT ROOM. BORIS SPRANG THROUGH THE DOORWAY AND IFOLLOWED BUT WE WERE TOO LATE. SHE LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL HERHANDS ACROSS HER BREAST. THEN BORIS SHOT HIMSELF THROUGH THE HEART. JACKSTOPPED SPEAKING DROPS OF SWEAT STOOD UNDER HIS EYES AND HIS THINCHEEKS TWITCHED. I CARRIED BORIS TO HIS ROOM. THEN I WENT BACK AND LETTHAT HELLISH FLUID OUT OF THE POOL AND TURNING ON ALL THE WATER WASHEDTHE MARBLE CLEAN OF EVERY DROP. WHEN AT LENGTH I DARED DESCEND THE STEPSI FOUND HER LYING THERE AS WHITE AS SNOW. AT LAST WHEN I HAD DECIDEDWHAT WAS BEST TO DO I WENT INTO THE LABORATORY AND FIRST EMPTIED THESOLUTION IN THE BASIN INTO THE WASTEPIPE THEN I POURED THE CONTENTS OFEVERY JAR AND BOTTLE AFTER IT. THERE WAS WOOD IN THE FIREPLACE SO IBUILT A FIRE AND BREAKING THE LOCKS OF BORIS CABINET I BURNT EVERYPAPER NOTEBOOK AND LETTER THAT I FOUND THERE. WITH A MALLET FROM THESTUDIO I SMASHED TO PIECES ALL THE EMPTY BOTTLES THEN LOADING THEM INTOA COALSCUTTLE I CARRIED THEM TO THE CELLAR AND THREW THEM OVER THEREDHOT BED OF THE FURNACE. SIX TIMES I MADE THE JOURNEY AND AT LASTNOT A VESTIGE REMAINED OF ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT AGAIN AID IN SEEKING FORTHE FORMULA WHICH BORIS HAD FOUND. THEN AT LAST I DARED CALL THE DOCTOR.HE IS A GOOD MAN AND TOGETHER WE STRUGGLED TO KEEP IT FROM THE PUBLIC.WITHOUT HIM I NEVER COULD HAVE SUCCEEDED. AT LAST WE GOT THE SERVANTSPAID AND SENT AWAY INTO THE COUNTRY WHERE OLD ROSIER KEEPS THEM QUIETWITH STONES OF BORIS AND GENEVIVES TRAVELS IN DISTANT LANDS FROMWHENCE THEY WILL NOT RETURN FOR YEARS. WE BURIED BORIS IN THE LITTLECEMETERY OF SVRES. THE DOCTOR IS A GOOD CREATURE AND KNOWS WHEN TO PITYA MAN WHO CAN BEAR NO MORE. HE GAVE HIS CERTIFICATE OF HEART DISEASE ANDASKED NO QUESTIONS OF ME.THEN LIFTING HIS HEAD FROM HIS HANDS HE SAID OPEN THE LETTER ALECIT IS FOR US BOTH.I TORE IT OPEN. IT WAS BORIS WILL DATED A YEAR BEFORE. HE LEFTEVERYTHING TO GENEVIVE AND IN CASE OF HER DYING CHILDLESS I WAS TOTAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE IN THE RUE SAINTECCILE AND JACK SCOTT THEMANAGEMENT AT EPT. ON OUR DEATHS THE PROPERTY REVERTED TO HIS MOTHERSFAMILY IN RUSSIA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SCULPTURED MARBLES EXECUTEDBY HIMSELF. THESE HE LEFT TO ME.THE PAGE BLURRED UNDER OUR EYES AND JACK GOT UP AND WALKED TO THEWINDOW. PRESENTLY HE RETURNED AND SAT DOWN AGAIN. I DREADED TO HEAR WHATHE WAS GOING TO SAY BUT HE SPOKE WITH THE SAME SIMPLICITY ANDGENTLENESS.GENEVIVE LIES BEFORE THE MADONNA IN THE MARBLE ROOM. THE MADONNA BENDSTENDERLY ABOVE HER AND GENEVIVE SMILES BACK INTO THAT CALM FACE THATNEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCEPT FOR HER.HIS VOICE BROKE BUT HE GRASPED MY HAND SAYING COURAGE ALEC. NEXTMORNING HE LEFT FOR EPT TO FULFIL HIS TRUST.IVTHE SAME EVENING I TOOK THE KEYS AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE I HAD KNOWN SOWELL. EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER BUT THE SILENCE WAS TERRIBLE. THOUGH IWENT TWICE TO THE DOOR OF THE MARBLE ROOM I COULD NOT FORCE MYSELF TOENTER. IT WAS BEYOND MY STRENGTH. I WENT INTO THE SMOKINGROOM AND SATDOWN BEFORE THE SPINET. A SMALL LACE HANDKERCHIEF LAY ON THE KEYS AND ITURNED AWAY CHOKING. IT WAS PLAIN I COULD NOT STAY SO I LOCKED EVERYDOOR EVERY WINDOW AND THE THREE FRONT AND BACK GATES AND WENT AWAY.NEXT MORNING ALCIDE PACKED MY VALISE AND LEAVING HIM IN CHARGE OF MYAPARTMENTS I TOOK THE ORIENT EXPRESS FOR CONSTANTINOPLE. DURING THE TWOYEARS THAT I WANDERED THROUGH THE EAST AT FIRST IN OUR LETTERS WENEVER MENTIONED GENEVIVE AND BORIS BUT GRADUALLY THEIR NAMES CREPT IN.I RECOLLECT PARTICULARLY A PASSAGE IN ONE OF JACKS LETTERS REPLYING TOONE OF MINEWHAT YOU TELL ME OF SEEING BORIS BENDING OVER YOU WHILE YOU LAY ILL ANDFEELING HIS TOUCH ON YOUR FACE AND HEARING HIS VOICE OF COURSE TROUBLESME. THIS THAT YOU DESCRIBE MUST HAVE HAPPENED A FORTNIGHT AFTER HE DIED.I SAY TO MYSELF THAT YOU WERE DREAMING THAT IT WAS PART OF YOURDELIRIUM BUT THE EXPLANATION DOES NOT SATISFY ME NOR WOULD IT YOU.TOWARD THE END OF THE SECOND YEAR A LETTER CAME FROM JACK TO ME IN INDIASO UNLIKE ANYTHING THAT I HAD EVER KNOWN OF HIM THAT I DECIDED TO RETURNAT ONCE TO PARIS. HE WROTE I AM WELL AND SELL ALL MY PICTURES ASARTISTS DO WHO HAVE NO NEED OF MONEY. I HAVE NOT A CARE OF MY OWN BUT IAM MORE RESTLESS THAN IF I HAD. I AM UNABLE TO SHAKE OFF A STRANGEANXIETY ABOUT YOU. IT IS NOT APPREHENSION IT IS RATHER A BREATHLESSEXPECTANCYOF WHAT GOD KNOWS I CAN ONLY SAY IT IS WEARING ME OUT.NIGHTS I DREAM ALWAYS OF YOU AND BORIS. I CAN NEVER RECALL ANYTHINGAFTERWARD BUT I WAKE IN THE MORNING WITH MY HEART BEATING AND ALL DAYTHE EXCITEMENT INCREASES UNTIL I FALL ASLEEP AT NIGHT TO RECALL THE SAMEEXPERIENCE. I AM QUITE EXHAUSTED BY IT AND HAVE DETERMINED TO BREAK UPTHIS MORBID CONDITION. I MUST SEE YOU. SHALL I GO TO BOMBAY OR WILL YOUCOME TO PARISI TELEGRAPHED HIM TO EXPECT ME BY THE NEXT STEAMER.WHEN WE MET I THOUGHT HE HAD CHANGED VERY LITTLE I HE INSISTED LOOKEDIN SPLENDID HEALTH. IT WAS GOOD TO HEAR HIS VOICE AGAIN AND AS WE SATAND CHATTED ABOUT WHAT LIFE STILL HELD FOR US WE FELT THAT IT WASPLEASANT TO BE ALIVE IN THE BRIGHT SPRING WEATHER.WE STAYED IN PARIS TOGETHER A WEEK AND THEN I WENT FOR A WEEK TO EPTWITH HIM BUT FIRST OF ALL WE WENT TO THE CEMETERY AT SVRES WHERE BORISLAY.SHALL WE PLACE THE FATES IN THE LITTLE GROVE ABOVE HIM JACK ASKEDAND I ANSWEREDI THINK ONLY THE MADONNA SHOULD WATCH OVER BORIS GRAVE. BUT JACK WASNONE THE BETTER FOR MY HOMECOMING. THE DREAMS OF WHICH HE COULD NOTRETAIN EVEN THE LEAST DEFINITE OUTLINE CONTINUED AND HE SAID THAT ATTIMES THE SENSE OF BREATHLESS EXPECTANCY WAS SUFFOCATING.YOU SEE I DO YOU HARM AND NOT GOOD I SAID. TRY A CHANGE WITHOUT ME.SO HE STARTED ALONE FOR A RAMBLE AMONG THE CHANNEL ISLANDS AND I WENTBACK TO PARIS. I HAD NOT YET ENTERED BORIS HOUSE NOW MINE SINCE MYRETURN BUT I KNEW IT MUST BE DONE. IT HAD BEEN KEPT IN ORDER BY JACKTHERE WERE SERVANTS THERE SO I GAVE UP MY OWN APARTMENT AND WENT THERETO LIVE. INSTEAD OF THE AGITATION I HAD FEARED I FOUND MYSELF ABLE TOPAINT THERE TRANQUILLY. I VISITED ALL THE ROOMSALL BUT ONE. I COULD NOTBRING MYSELF TO ENTER THE MARBLE ROOM WHERE GENEVIVE LAY AND YET I FELTTHE LONGING GROWING DAILY TO LOOK UPON HER FACE TO KNEEL BESIDE HER.ONE APRIL AFTERNOON I LAY DREAMING IN THE SMOKINGROOM JUST AS I HADLAIN TWO YEARS BEFORE AND MECHANICALLY I LOOKED AMONG THE TAWNY EASTERNRUGS FOR THE WOLFSKIN. AT LAST I DISTINGUISHED THE POINTED EARS AND FLATCRUEL HEAD AND I THOUGHT OF MY DREAM WHERE I SAW GENEVIVE LYING BESIDEIT. THE HELMETS STILL HUNG AGAINST THE THREADBARE TAPESTRY AMONG THEMTHE OLD SPANISH MORION WHICH I REMEMBERED GENEVIVE HAD ONCE PUT ON WHENWE WERE AMUSING OURSELVES WITH THE ANCIENT BITS OF MAIL. I TURNED MY EYESTO THE SPINET EVERY YELLOW KEY SEEMED ELOQUENT OF HER CARESSING HANDAND I ROSE DRAWN BY THE STRENGTH OF MY LIFES PASSION TO THE SEALED DOOROF THE MARBLE ROOM. THE HEAVY DOORS SWUNG INWARD UNDER MY TREMBLINGHANDS. SUNLIGHT POURED THROUGH THE WINDOW TIPPING WITH GOLD THE WINGS OFCUPID AND LINGERED LIKE A NIMBUS OVER THE BROWS OF THE MADONNA. HERTENDER FACE BENT IN COMPASSION OVER A MARBLE FORM SO EXQUISITELY PURETHAT I KNELT AND SIGNED MYSELF. GENEVIVE LAY IN THE SHADOW UNDER THEMADONNA AND YET THROUGH HER WHITE ARMS I SAW THE PALE AZURE VEIN ANDBENEATH HER SOFTLY CLASPED HANDS THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS WERE TINGED WITHROSE AS IF FROM SOME FAINT WARM LIGHT WITHIN HER BREAST.BENDING WITH A BREAKING HEART I TOUCHED THE MARBLE DRAPERY WITH MYLIPS THEN CREPT BACK INTO THE SILENT HOUSE.A MAID CAME AND BROUGHT ME A LETTER AND I SAT DOWN IN THE LITTLECONSERVATORY TO READ IT BUT AS I WAS ABOUT TO BREAK THE SEAL SEEING THEGIRL LINGERING I ASKED HER WHAT SHE WANTED.SHE STAMMERED SOMETHING ABOUT A WHITE RABBIT THAT HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN THEHOUSE AND ASKED WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH IT I TOLD HER TO LET IT LOOSEIN THE WALLED GARDEN BEHIND THE HOUSE AND OPENED MY LETTER. IT WAS FROMJACK BUT SO INCOHERENT THAT I THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE LOST HIS REASON. ITWAS NOTHING BUT A SERIES OF PRAYERS TO ME NOT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE UNTIL HECOULD GET BACK HE COULD NOT TELL ME WHY THERE WERE THE DREAMS HESAIDHE COULD EXPLAIN NOTHING BUT HE WAS SURE THAT I MUST NOT LEAVE THEHOUSE IN THE RUE SAINTECCILE.AS I FINISHED READING I RAISED MY EYES AND SAW THE SAME MAIDSERVANTSTANDING IN THE DOORWAY HOLDING A GLASS DISH IN WHICH TWO GOLDFISH WERESWIMMING PUT THEM BACK INTO THE TANK AND TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN BYINTERRUPTING ME I SAID.WITH A HALFSUPPRESSED WHIMPER SHE EMPTIED WATER AND FISH INTO ANAQUARIUM AT THE END OF THE CONSERVATORY AND TURNING TO ME ASKED MYPERMISSION TO LEAVE MY SERVICE. SHE SAID PEOPLE WERE PLAYING TRICKS ONHER EVIDENTLY WITH A DESIGN OF GETTING HER INTO TROUBLE THE MARBLERABBIT HAD BEEN STOLEN AND A LIVE ONE HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSETHE TWO BEAUTIFUL MARBLE FISH WERE GONE AND SHE HAD JUST FOUND THOSECOMMON LIVE THINGS FLOPPING ON THE DININGROOM FLOOR. I REASSURED HER ANDSENT HER AWAY SAYING I WOULD LOOK ABOUT MYSELF. I WENT INTO THE STUDIOTHERE WAS NOTHING THERE BUT MY CANVASES AND SOME CASTS EXCEPT THE MARBLEOF THE EASTER LILY. I SAW IT ON A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM. THEN I STRODEANGRILY OVER TO IT. BUT THE FLOWER I LIFTED FROM THE TABLE WAS FRESH ANDFRAGILE AND FILLED THE AIR WITH PERFUME.THEN SUDDENLY I COMPREHENDED AND SPRANG THROUGH THE HALLWAY TO THEMARBLE ROOM. THE DOORS FLEW OPEN THE SUNLIGHT STREAMED INTO MY FACE ANDTHROUGH IT IN A HEAVENLY GLORY THE MADONNA SMILED AS GENEVIVE LIFTEDHER FLUSHED FACE FROM HER MARBLE COUCH AND OPENED HER SLEEPY EYES.IN THE COURT OF THE DRAGON  OH THOU WHO BURNST IN HEART FOR THOSE WHO BURN  IN HELL WHOSE FIRES THYSELF SHALL FEED IN TURN  HOW LONG BE CRYINGMERCY ON THEM. GOD  WHY WHO ART THOU TO TEACH AND HE TO LEARNIN THE CHURCH OF ST. BARNAB VESPERS WERE OVER THE CLERGY LEFT THEALTAR THE LITTLE CHOIRBOYS FLOCKED ACROSS THE CHANCEL AND SETTLED INTHE STALLS. A SUISSE IN RICH UNIFORM MARCHED DOWN THE SOUTH AISLESOUNDING HIS STAFF AT EVERY FOURTH STEP ON THE STONE PAVEMENT BEHIND HIMCAME THAT ELOQUENT PREACHER AND GOOD MAN MONSEIGNEUR C.MY CHAIR WAS NEAR THE CHANCEL RAIL I NOW TURNED TOWARD THE WEST END OFTHE CHURCH. THE OTHER PEOPLE BETWEEN THE ALTAR AND THE PULPIT TURNED TOO.THERE WAS A LITTLE SCRAPING AND RUSTLING WHILE THE CONGREGATION SEATEDITSELF AGAIN THE PREACHER MOUNTED THE PULPIT STAIRS AND THE ORGANVOLUNTARY CEASED.I HAD ALWAYS FOUND THE ORGANPLAYING AT ST. BARNAB HIGHLY INTERESTING.LEARNED AND SCIENTIFIC IT WAS TOO MUCH SO FOR MY SMALL KNOWLEDGE BUTEXPRESSING A VIVID IF COLD INTELLIGENCE. MOREOVER IT POSSESSED THEFRENCH QUALITY OF TASTE TASTE REIGNED SUPREME SELFCONTROLLEDDIGNIFIED AND RETICENT.TODAY HOWEVER FROM THE FIRST CHORD I HAD FELT A CHANGE FOR THE WORSEA SINISTER CHANGE. DURING VESPERS IT HAD BEEN CHIEFLY THE CHANCEL ORGANWHICH SUPPORTED THE BEAUTIFUL CHOIR BUT NOW AND AGAIN QUITE WANTONLY ASIT SEEMED FROM THE WEST GALLERY WHERE THE GREAT ORGAN STANDS A HEAVYHAND HAD STRUCK ACROSS THE CHURCH AT THE SERENE PEACE OF THOSE CLEARVOICES. IT WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN HARSH AND DISSONANT AND IT BETRAYEDNO LACK OF SKILL. AS IT RECURRED AGAIN AND AGAIN IT SET ME THINKING OFWHAT MY ARCHITECTS BOOKS SAY ABOUT THE CUSTOM IN EARLY TIMES TOCONSECRATE THE CHOIR AS SOON AS IT WAS BUILT AND THAT THE NAVE BEINGFINISHED SOMETIMES HALF A CENTURY LATER OFTEN DID NOT GET ANY BLESSINGAT ALL I WONDERED IDLY IF THAT HAD BEEN THE CASE AT ST. BARNAB ANDWHETHER SOMETHING NOT USUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE AT HOME IN A CHRISTIANCHURCH MIGHT HAVE ENTERED UNDETECTED AND TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE WESTGALLERY. I HAD READ OF SUCH THINGS HAPPENING TOO BUT NOT IN WORKS ONARCHITECTURE.THEN I REMEMBERED THAT ST. BARNAB WAS NOT MUCH MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARSOLD AND SMILED AT THE INCONGRUOUS ASSOCIATION OF MEDIAEVAL SUPERSTITIONSWITH THAT CHEERFUL LITTLE PIECE OF EIGHTEENTHCENTURY ROCOCO.BUT NOW VESPERS WERE OVER AND THERE SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED A FEW QUIETCHORDS FIT TO ACCOMPANY MEDITATION WHILE WE WAITED FOR THE SERMON.INSTEAD OF THAT THE DISCORD AT THE LOWER END OF THE CHURCH BROKE OUTWITH THE DEPARTURE OF THE CLERGY AS IF NOW NOTHING COULD CONTROL IT.I BELONG TO THOSE CHILDREN OF AN OLDER AND SIMPLER GENERATION WHO DO NOTLOVE TO SEEK FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL SUBTLETIES IN ART AND I HAVE EVER REFUSEDTO FIND IN MUSIC ANYTHING MORE THAN MELODY AND HARMONY BUT I FELT THATIN THE LABYRINTH OF SOUNDS NOW ISSUING FROM THAT INSTRUMENT THERE WASSOMETHING BEING HUNTED. UP AND DOWN THE PEDALS CHASED HIM WHILE THEMANUALS BLARED APPROVAL. POOR DEVIL WHOEVER HE WAS THERE SEEMED SMALLHOPE OF ESCAPEMY NERVOUS ANNOYANCE CHANGED TO ANGER. WHO WAS DOING THIS HOW DARE HEPLAY LIKE THAT IN THE MIDST OF DIVINE SERVICE I GLANCED AT THE PEOPLENEAR ME NOT ONE APPEARED TO BE IN THE LEAST DISTURBED. THE PLACID BROWSOF THE KNEELING NUNS STILL TURNED TOWARDS THE ALTAR LOST NONE OF THEIRDEVOUT ABSTRACTION UNDER THE PALE SHADOW OF THEIR WHITE HEADDRESS. THEFASHIONABLE LADY BESIDE ME WAS LOOKING EXPECTANTLY AT MONSEIGNEUR C.FOR ALL HER FACE BETRAYED THE ORGAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN SINGING AN AVEMARIA.BUT NOW AT LAST THE PREACHER HAD MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS ANDCOMMANDED SILENCE. I TURNED TO HIM GLADLY. THUS FAR I HAD NOT FOUND THEREST I HAD COUNTED ON WHEN I ENTERED ST. BARNAB THAT AFTERNOON.I WAS WORN OUT BY THREE NIGHTS OF PHYSICAL SUFFERING AND MENTAL TROUBLETHE LAST HAD BEEN THE WORST AND IT WAS AN EXHAUSTED BODY AND A MINDBENUMBED AND YET ACUTELY SENSITIVE WHICH I HAD BROUGHT TO MY FAVOURITECHURCH FOR HEALING. FOR I HAD BEEN READING THE KING IN YELLOW.THE SUN ARISETH THEY GATHER THEMSELVES TOGETHER AND LAY THEM DOWN INTHEIR DENS. MONSEIGNEUR C DELIVERED HIS TEXT IN A CALM VOICEGLANCING QUIETLY OVER THE CONGREGATION. MY EYES TURNED I KNEW NOT WHYTOWARD THE LOWER END OF THE CHURCH. THE ORGANIST WAS COMING FROM BEHINDHIS PIPES AND PASSING ALONG THE GALLERY ON HIS WAY OUT I SAW HIMDISAPPEAR BY A SMALL DOOR THAT LEADS TO SOME STAIRS WHICH DESCENDDIRECTLY TO THE STREET. HE WAS A SLENDER MAN AND HIS FACE WAS AS WHITEAS HIS COAT WAS BLACK. GOOD RIDDANCE I THOUGHT WITH YOUR WICKEDMUSIC I HOPE YOUR ASSISTANT WILL PLAY THE CLOSING VOLUNTARY.WITH A FEELING OF RELIEFWITH A DEEP CALM FEELING OF RELIEF I TURNEDBACK TO THE MILD FACE IN THE PULPIT AND SETTLED MYSELF TO LISTEN. HEREAT LAST WAS THE EASE OF MIND I LONGED FOR.MY CHILDREN SAID THE PREACHER ONE TRUTH THE HUMAN SOUL FINDS HARDESTOF ALL TO LEARN THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO FEAR. IT CAN NEVER BE MADE TO SEETHAT NOTHING CAN REALLY HARM IT.CURIOUS DOCTRINE I THOUGHT FOR A CATHOLIC PRIEST. LET US SEE HOW HEWILL RECONCILE THAT WITH THE FATHERS.NOTHING CAN REALLY HARM THE SOUL HE WENT ON IN HIS COOLEST CLEARESTTONES BECAUSEBUT I NEVER HEARD THE REST MY EYE LEFT HIS FACE I KNEW NOT FOR WHATREASON AND SOUGHT THE LOWER END OF THE CHURCH. THE SAME MAN WAS COMINGOUT FROM BEHIND THE ORGAN AND WAS PASSING ALONG THE GALLERY THE SAMEWAY. BUT THERE HAD NOT BEEN TIME FOR HIM TO RETURN AND IF HE HADRETURNED I MUST HAVE SEEN HIM. I FELT A FAINT CHILL AND MY HEART SANKAND YET HIS GOING AND COMING WERE NO AFFAIR OF MINE. I LOOKED AT HIM ICOULD NOT LOOK AWAY FROM HIS BLACK FIGURE AND HIS WHITE FACE. WHEN HE WASEXACTLY OPPOSITE TO ME HE TURNED AND SENT ACROSS THE CHURCH STRAIGHTINTO MY EYES A LOOK OF HATE INTENSE AND DEADLY I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYOTHER LIKE IT WOULD TO GOD I MIGHT NEVER SEE IT AGAIN THEN HEDISAPPEARED BY THE SAME DOOR THROUGH WHICH I HAD WATCHED HIM DEPART LESSTHAN SIXTY SECONDS BEFORE.I SAT AND TRIED TO COLLECT MY THOUGHTS. MY FIRST SENSATION WAS LIKE THATOF A VERY YOUNG CHILD BADLY HURT WHEN IT CATCHES ITS BREATH BEFORECRYING OUT.TO SUDDENLY FIND MYSELF THE OBJECT OF SUCH HATRED WAS EXQUISITELYPAINFUL AND THIS MAN WAS AN UTTER STRANGER. WHY SHOULD HE HATE MESOME WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE FOR THE MOMENT ALL OTHERSENSATION WAS MERGED IN THIS ONE PANG EVEN FEAR WAS SUBORDINATE TOGRIEF AND FOR THAT MOMENT I NEVER DOUBTED BUT IN THE NEXT I BEGAN TOREASON AND A SENSE OF THE INCONGRUOUS CAME TO MY AID.AS I HAVE SAID ST. BARNAB IS A MODERN CHURCH. IT IS SMALL AND WELLLIGHTED ONE SEES ALL OVER IT ALMOST AT A GLANCE. THE ORGAN GALLERY GETSA STRONG WHITE LIGHT FROM A ROW OF LONG WINDOWS IN THE CLERESTORY WHICHHAVE NOT EVEN COLOURED GLASS.THE PULPIT BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CHURCH IT FOLLOWED THAT WHEN IWAS TURNED TOWARD IT WHATEVER MOVED AT THE WEST END COULD NOT FAIL TOATTRACT MY EYE. WHEN THE ORGANIST PASSED IT WAS NO WONDER THAT I SAW HIMI HAD SIMPLY MISCALCULATED THE INTERVAL BETWEEN HIS FIRST AND HIS SECONDPASSING. HE HAD COME IN THAT LAST TIME BY THE OTHER SIDEDOOR. AS FOR THELOOK WHICH HAD SO UPSET ME THERE HAD BEEN NO SUCH THING AND I WAS ANERVOUS FOOL.I LOOKED ABOUT. THIS WAS A LIKELY PLACE TO HARBOUR SUPERNATURAL HORRORSTHAT CLEARCUT REASONABLE FACE OF MONSEIGNEUR C HIS COLLECTEDMANNER AND EASY GRACEFUL GESTURES WERE THEY NOT JUST A LITTLEDISCOURAGING TO THE NOTION OF A GRUESOME MYSTERY I GLANCED ABOVE HISHEAD AND ALMOST LAUGHED. THAT FLYAWAY LADY SUPPORTING ONE CORNER OF THEPULPIT CANOPY WHICH LOOKED LIKE A FRINGED DAMASK TABLECLOTH IN A HIGHWIND AT THE FIRST ATTEMPT OF A BASILISK TO POSE UP THERE IN THE ORGANLOFT SHE WOULD POINT HER GOLD TRUMPET AT HIM AND PUFF HIM OUT OFEXISTENCE I LAUGHED TO MYSELF OVER THIS CONCEIT WHICH AT THE TIME ITHOUGHT VERY AMUSING AND SAT AND CHAFFED MYSELF AND EVERYTHING ELSEFROM THE OLD HARPY OUTSIDE THE RAILING WHO HAD MADE ME PAY TEN CENTIMESFOR MY CHAIR BEFORE SHE WOULD LET ME IN SHE WAS MORE LIKE A BASILISK ITOLD MYSELF THAN WAS MY ORGANIST WITH THE ANAEMIC COMPLEXION FROM THATGRIM OLD DAME TO YES ALAS MONSEIGNEUR C HIMSELF. FOR ALLDEVOUTNESS HAD FLED. I HAD NEVER YET DONE SUCH A THING IN MY LIFE BUTNOW I FELT A DESIRE TO MOCK.AS FOR THE SERMON I COULD NOT HEAR A WORD OF IT FOR THE JINGLE IN MYEARS OF THE SKIRTS OF ST. PAUL HAS REACHED.  HAVING PREACHED US THOSE SIX LENT LECTURES  MORE UNCTUOUS THAN EVER HE PREACHEDKEEPING TIME TO THE MOST FANTASTIC AND IRREVERENT THOUGHTS.IT WAS NO USE TO SIT THERE ANY LONGER I MUST GET OUT OF DOORS AND SHAKEMYSELF FREE FROM THIS HATEFUL MOOD. I KNEW THE RUDENESS I WAS COMMITTINGBUT STILL I ROSE AND LEFT THE CHURCH.A SPRING SUN WAS SHINING ON THE RUE ST. HONOR AS I RAN DOWN THE CHURCHSTEPS. ON ONE CORNER STOOD A BARROW FULL OF YELLOW JONQUILS PALE VIOLETSFROM THE RIVIERA DARK RUSSIAN VIOLETS AND WHITE ROMAN HYACINTHS IN AGOLDEN CLOUD OF MIMOSA. THE STREET WAS FULL OF SUNDAY PLEASURESEEKERS. ISWUNG MY CANE AND LAUGHED WITH THE REST. SOME ONE OVERTOOK AND PASSED ME.HE NEVER TURNED BUT THERE WAS THE SAME DEADLY MALIGNITY IN HIS WHITEPROFILE THAT THERE HAD BEEN IN HIS EYES. I WATCHED HIM AS LONG AS I COULDSEE HIM. HIS LITHE BACK EXPRESSED THE SAME MENACE EVERY STEP THATCARRIED HIM AWAY FROM ME SEEMED TO BEAR HIM ON SOME ERRAND CONNECTED WITHMY DESTRUCTION.I WAS CREEPING ALONG MY FEET ALMOST REFUSING TO MOVE. THERE BEGAN TODAWN IN ME A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOMETHING LONG FORGOTTEN. ITBEGAN TO SEEM AS IF I DESERVED THAT WHICH HE THREATENED IT REACHED ALONG WAY BACKA LONG LONG WAY BACK. IT HAD LAIN DORMANT ALL THESEYEARS IT WAS THERE THOUGH AND PRESENTLY IT WOULD RISE AND CONFRONT ME.BUT I WOULD TRY TO ESCAPE AND I STUMBLED AS BEST I COULD INTO THE RUE DERIVOLI ACROSS THE PLACE DE LA CONCORDE AND ON TO THE QUAI. I LOOKED WITHSICK EYES UPON THE SUN SHINING THROUGH THE WHITE FOAM OF THE FOUNTAINPOURING OVER THE BACKS OF THE DUSKY BRONZE RIVERGODS ON THE FARAWAYARC A STRUCTURE OF AMETHYST MIST ON THE COUNTLESS VISTAS OF GREY STEMSAND BARE BRANCHES FAINTLY GREEN. THEN I SAW HIM AGAIN COMING DOWN ONE OFTHE CHESTNUT ALLEYS OF THE COURS LA REINE.I LEFT THE RIVERSIDE PLUNGED BLINDLY ACROSS TO THE CHAMPS ELYSES ANDTURNED TOWARD THE ARC. THE SETTING SUN WAS SENDING ITS RAYS ALONG THEGREEN SWARD OF THE RONDPOINT IN THE FULL GLOW HE SAT ON A BENCHCHILDREN AND YOUNG MOTHERS ALL ABOUT HIM. HE WAS NOTHING BUT A SUNDAYLOUNGER LIKE THE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF. I SAID THE WORDS ALMOST ALOUD ANDALL THE WHILE I GAZED ON THE MALIGNANT HATRED OF HIS FACE. BUT HE WAS NOTLOOKING AT ME. I CREPT PAST AND DRAGGED MY LEADEN FEET UP THE AVENUE. IKNEW THAT EVERY TIME I MET HIM BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENTOF HIS PURPOSE AND MY FATE. AND STILL I TRIED TO SAVE MYSELF.THE LAST RAYS OF SUNSET WERE POURING THROUGH THE GREAT ARC. I PASSEDUNDER IT AND MET HIM FACE TO FACE. I HAD LEFT HIM FAR DOWN THE CHAMPSELYSES AND YET HE CAME IN WITH A STREAM OF PEOPLE WHO WERE RETURNINGFROM THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE. HE CAME SO CLOSE THAT HE BRUSHED ME. HISSLENDER FRAME FELT LIKE IRON INSIDE ITS LOOSE BLACK COVERING. HE SHOWEDNO SIGNS OF HASTE NOR OF FATIGUE NOR OF ANY HUMAN FEELING. HIS WHOLEBEING EXPRESSED ONE THING THE WILL AND THE POWER TO WORK ME EVIL.IN ANGUISH I WATCHED HIM WHERE HE WENT DOWN THE BROAD CROWDED AVENUETHAT WAS ALL FLASHING WITH WHEELS AND THE TRAPPINGS OF HORSES AND THEHELMETS OF THE GARDE REPUBLICAINE.HE WAS SOON LOST TO SIGHT THEN I TURNED AND FLED. INTO THE BOIS AND FAROUT BEYOND ITI KNOW NOT WHERE I WENT BUT AFTER A LONG WHILE AS ITSEEMED TO ME NIGHT HAD FALLEN AND I FOUND MYSELF SITTING AT A TABLEBEFORE A SMALL CAF. I HAD WANDERED BACK INTO THE BOIS. IT WAS HOURS NOWSINCE I HAD SEEN HIM. PHYSICAL FATIGUE AND MENTAL SUFFERING HAD LEFT MENO POWER TO THINK OR FEEL. I WAS TIRED SO TIRED I LONGED TO HIDE AWAYIN MY OWN DEN. I RESOLVED TO GO HOME. BUT THAT WAS A LONG WAY OFF.I LIVE IN THE COURT OF THE DRAGON A NARROW PASSAGE THAT LEADS FROM THERUE DE RENNES TO THE RUE DU DRAGON.IT IS AN IMPASSE TRAVERSABLE ONLY FOR FOOT PASSENGERS. OVER THEENTRANCE ON THE RUE DE RENNES IS A BALCONY SUPPORTED BY AN IRON DRAGON.WITHIN THE COURT TALL OLD HOUSES RISE ON EITHER SIDE AND CLOSE THE ENDSTHAT GIVE ON THE TWO STREETS. HUGE GATES SWUNG BACK DURING THE DAY INTOTHE WALLS OF THE DEEP ARCHWAYS CLOSE THIS COURT AFTER MIDNIGHT AND ONEMUST ENTER THEN BY RINGING AT CERTAIN SMALL DOORS ON THE SIDE. THE SUNKENPAVEMENT COLLECTS UNSAVOURY POOLS. STEEP STAIRWAYS PITCH DOWN TO DOORSTHAT OPEN ON THE COURT. THE GROUND FLOORS ARE OCCUPIED BY SHOPS OFSECONDHAND DEALERS AND BY IRON WORKERS. ALL DAY LONG THE PLACE RINGSWITH THE CLINK OF HAMMERS AND THE CLANG OF METAL BARS.UNSAVOURY AS IT IS BELOW THERE IS CHEERFULNESS AND COMFORT AND HARDHONEST WORK ABOVE.FIVE FLIGHTS UP ARE THE ATELIERS OF ARCHITECTS AND PAINTERS AND THEHIDINGPLACES OF MIDDLEAGED STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF WHO WANT TO LIVE ALONE.WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE TO LIVE I WAS YOUNG AND NOT ALONE.I HAD TO WALK A WHILE BEFORE ANY CONVEYANCE APPEARED BUT AT LAST WHEN IHAD ALMOST REACHED THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE AGAIN AN EMPTY CAB CAME ALONG ANDI TOOK IT.FROM THE ARC TO THE RUE DE RENNES IS A DRIVE OF MORE THAN HALF AN HOURESPECIALLY WHEN ONE IS CONVEYED BY A TIRED CAB HORSE THAT HAS BEEN AT THEMERCY OF SUNDAY FETEMAKERS.THERE HAD BEEN TIME BEFORE I PASSED UNDER THE DRAGONS WINGS TO MEET MYENEMY OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT I NEVER SAW HIM ONCE AND NOW REFUGE WASCLOSE AT HAND.BEFORE THE WIDE GATEWAY A SMALL MOB OF CHILDREN WERE PLAYING. OURCONCIERGE AND HIS WIFE WALKED AMONG THEM WITH THEIR BLACK POODLEKEEPING ORDER SOME COUPLES WERE WALTZING ON THE SIDEWALK. I RETURNEDTHEIR GREETINGS AND HURRIED IN.ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE COURT HAD TROOPED OUT INTO THE STREET. THEPLACE WAS QUITE DESERTED LIGHTED BY A FEW LANTERNS HUNG HIGH UP INWHICH THE GAS BURNED DIMLY.MY APARTMENT WAS AT THE TOP OF A HOUSE HALFWAY DOWN THE COURT REACHEDBY A STAIRCASE THAT DESCENDED ALMOST INTO THE STREET WITH ONLY A BIT OFPASSAGEWAY INTERVENING I SET MY FOOT ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE OPEN DOORTHE FRIENDLY OLD RUINOUS STAIRS ROSE BEFORE ME LEADING UP TO REST ANDSHELTER. LOOKING BACK OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER I SAW HIM TEN PACESOFF. HE MUST HAVE ENTERED THE COURT WITH ME.HE WAS COMING STRAIGHT ON NEITHER SLOWLY NOR SWIFTLY BUT STRAIGHT ONTO ME. AND NOW HE WAS LOOKING AT ME. FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE OUR EYESENCOUNTERED ACROSS THE CHURCH THEY MET NOW AGAIN AND I KNEW THAT THETIME HAD COME.RETREATING BACKWARD DOWN THE COURT I FACED HIM. I MEANT TO ESCAPE BYTHE ENTRANCE ON THE RUE DU DRAGON. HIS EYES TOLD ME THAT I NEVER SHOULDESCAPE.IT SEEMED AGES WHILE WE WERE GOING I RETREATING HE ADVANCING DOWN THECOURT IN PERFECT SILENCE BUT AT LAST I FELT THE SHADOW OF THE ARCHWAYAND THE NEXT STEP BROUGHT ME WITHIN IT. I HAD MEANT TO TURN HERE ANDSPRING THROUGH INTO THE STREET. BUT THE SHADOW WAS NOT THAT OF ANARCHWAY IT WAS THAT OF A VAULT. THE GREAT DOORS ON THE RUE DU DRAGONWERE CLOSED. I FELT THIS BY THE BLACKNESS WHICH SURROUNDED ME AND AT THESAME INSTANT I READ IT IN HIS FACE. HOW HIS FACE GLEAMED IN THE DARKNESSDRAWING SWIFTLY NEARER THE DEEP VAULTS THE HUGE CLOSED DOORS THEIRCOLD IRON CLAMPS WERE ALL ON HIS SIDE. THE THING WHICH HE HAD THREATENEDHAD ARRIVED IT GATHERED AND BORE DOWN ON ME FROM THE FATHOMLESS SHADOWSTHE POINT FROM WHICH IT WOULD STRIKE WAS HIS INFERNAL EYES. HOPELESS ISET MY BACK AGAINST THE BARRED DOORS AND DEFIED HIM.THERE WAS A SCRAPING OF CHAIRS ON THE STONE FLOOR AND A RUSTLING AS THECONGREGATION ROSE. I COULD HEAR THE SUISSES STAFF IN THE SOUTH AISLEPRECEDING MONSEIGNEUR C TO THE SACRISTY.THE KNEELING NUNS ROUSED FROM THEIR DEVOUT ABSTRACTION MADE THEIRREVERENCE AND WENT AWAY. THE FASHIONABLE LADY MY NEIGHBOUR ROSE ALSOWITH GRACEFUL RESERVE. AS SHE DEPARTED HER GLANCE JUST FLITTED OVER MYFACE IN DISAPPROVAL.HALF DEAD OR SO IT SEEMED TO ME YET INTENSELY ALIVE TO EVERY TRIFLE ISAT AMONG THE LEISURELY MOVING CROWD THEN ROSE TOO AND WENT TOWARD THEDOOR.I HAD SLEPT THROUGH THE SERMON. HAD I SLEPT THROUGH THE SERMON I LOOKEDUP AND SAW HIM PASSING ALONG THE GALLERY TO HIS PLACE. ONLY HIS SIDE ISAW THE THIN BENT ARM IN ITS BLACK COVERING LOOKED LIKE ONE OF THOSEDEVILISH NAMELESS INSTRUMENTS WHICH LIE IN THE DISUSED TORTURECHAMBERSOF MEDIAEVAL CASTLES.BUT I HAD ESCAPED HIM THOUGH HIS EYES HAD SAID I SHOULD NOT. HADI ESCAPED HIM THAT WHICH GAVE HIM THE POWER OVER ME CAME BACK OUT OFOBLIVION WHERE I HAD HOPED TO KEEP IT. FOR I KNEW HIM NOW. DEATH AND THEAWFUL ABODE OF LOST SOULS WHITHER MY WEAKNESS LONG AGO HAD SENTHIMTHEY HAD CHANGED HIM FOR EVERY OTHER EYE BUT NOT FOR MINE. I HADRECOGNIZED HIM ALMOST FROM THE FIRST I HAD NEVER DOUBTED WHAT HE WASCOME TO DO AND NOW I KNEW WHILE MY BODY SAT SAFE IN THE CHEERFUL LITTLECHURCH HE HAD BEEN HUNTING MY SOUL IN THE COURT OF THE DRAGON.I CREPT TO THE DOOR THE ORGAN BROKE OUT OVERHEAD WITH A BLARE. ADAZZLING LIGHT FILLED THE CHURCH BLOTTING THE ALTAR FROM MY EYES. THEPEOPLE FADED AWAY THE ARCHES THE VAULTED ROOF VANISHED. I RAISED MYSEARED EYES TO THE FATHOMLESS GLARE AND I SAW THE BLACK STARS HANGING INTHE HEAVENS AND THE WET WINDS FROM THE LAKE OF HALI CHILLED MY FACE.AND NOW FAR AWAY OVER LEAGUES OF TOSSING CLOUDWAVES I SAW THE MOONDRIPPING WITH SPRAY AND BEYOND THE TOWERS OF CARCOSA ROSE BEHIND THEMOON.DEATH AND THE AWFUL ABODE OF LOST SOULS WHITHER MY WEAKNESS LONG AGO HADSENT HIM HAD CHANGED HIM FOR EVERY OTHER EYE BUT MINE. AND NOW I HEARDHIS VOICE RISING SWELLING THUNDERING THROUGH THE FLARING LIGHTAND AS I FELL THE RADIANCE INCREASING INCREASING POURED OVER ME INWAVES OF FLAME. THEN I SANK INTO THE DEPTHS AND I HEARD THE KING INYELLOW WHISPERING TO MY SOUL IT IS A FEARFUL THING TO FALL INTO THEHANDS OF THE LIVING GODTHE YELLOW SIGN  LET THE RED DAWN SURMISE    WHAT WE SHALL DO  WHEN THIS BLUE STARLIGHT DIES    AND ALL IS THROUGH.ITHERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WHICH ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY SHOULDCERTAIN CHORDS IN MUSIC MAKE ME THINK OF THE BROWN AND GOLDEN TINTS OFAUTUMN FOLIAGE WHY SHOULD THE MASS OF SAINTE CCILE BEND MY THOUGHTSWANDERING AMONG CAVERNS WHOSE WALLS BLAZE WITH RAGGED MASSES OF VIRGINSILVER WHAT WAS IT IN THE ROAR AND TURMOIL OF BROADWAY AT SIX OCLOCKTHAT FLASHED BEFORE MY EYES THE PICTURE OF A STILL BRETON FOREST WHERESUNLIGHT FILTERED THROUGH SPRING FOLIAGE AND SYLVIA BENT HALF CURIOUSLYHALF TENDERLY OVER A SMALL GREEN LIZARD MURMURING TO THINK THAT THISALSO IS A LITTLE WARD OF GODWHEN I FIRST SAW THE WATCHMAN HIS BACK WAS TOWARD ME. I LOOKED AT HIMINDIFFERENTLY UNTIL HE WENT INTO THE CHURCH. I PAID NO MORE ATTENTION TOHIM THAN I HAD TO ANY OTHER MAN WHO LOUNGED THROUGH WASHINGTON SQUARETHAT MORNING AND WHEN I SHUT MY WINDOW AND TURNED BACK INTO MY STUDIO IHAD FORGOTTEN HIM. LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THE DAY BEING WARM I RAISEDTHE WINDOW AGAIN AND LEANED OUT TO GET A SNIFF OF AIR. A MAN WAS STANDINGIN THE COURTYARD OF THE CHURCH AND I NOTICED HIM AGAIN WITH AS LITTLEINTEREST AS I HAD THAT MORNING. I LOOKED ACROSS THE SQUARE TO WHERE THEFOUNTAIN WAS PLAYING AND THEN WITH MY MIND FILLED WITH VAGUE IMPRESSIONSOF TREES ASPHALT DRIVES AND THE MOVING GROUPS OF NURSEMAIDS ANDHOLIDAYMAKERS I STARTED TO WALK BACK TO MY EASEL. AS I TURNED MYLISTLESS GLANCE INCLUDED THE MAN BELOW IN THE CHURCHYARD. HIS FACE WASTOWARD ME NOW AND WITH A PERFECTLY INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENT I BENT TO SEEIT. AT THE SAME MOMENT HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED AT ME. INSTANTLY ITHOUGHT OF A COFFINWORM. WHATEVER IT WAS ABOUT THE MAN THAT REPELLED MEI DID NOT KNOW BUT THE IMPRESSION OF A PLUMP WHITE GRAVEWORM WAS SOINTENSE AND NAUSEATING THAT I MUST HAVE SHOWN IT IN MY EXPRESSION FOR HETURNED HIS PUFFY FACE AWAY WITH A MOVEMENT WHICH MADE ME THINK OF ADISTURBED GRUB IN A CHESTNUT.I WENT BACK TO MY EASEL AND MOTIONED THE MODEL TO RESUME HER POSE. AFTERWORKING A WHILE I WAS SATISFIED THAT I WAS SPOILING WHAT I HAD DONE ASRAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE AND I TOOK UP A PALETTE KNIFE AND SCRAPED THE COLOUROUT AGAIN. THE FLESH TONES WERE SALLOW AND UNHEALTHY AND I DID NOTUNDERSTAND HOW I COULD HAVE PAINTED SUCH SICKLY COLOUR INTO A STUDY WHICHBEFORE THAT HAD GLOWED WITH HEALTHY TONES.I LOOKED AT TESSIE. SHE HAD NOT CHANGED AND THE CLEAR FLUSH OF HEALTHDYED HER NECK AND CHEEKS AS I FROWNED.IS IT SOMETHING IVE DONE SHE SAID.NOIVE MADE A MESS OF THIS ARM AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CANT SEEHOW I CAME TO PAINT SUCH MUD AS THAT INTO THE CANVAS I REPLIED.DONT I POSE WELL SHE INSISTED.OF COURSE PERFECTLY.THEN ITS NOT MY FAULTNO. ITS MY OWN.I AM VERY SORRY SHE SAID.I TOLD HER SHE COULD REST WHILE I APPLIED RAG AND TURPENTINE TO THEPLAGUE SPOT ON MY CANVAS AND SHE WENT OFF TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE AND LOOKOVER THE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE COURRIER FRANAIS.I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER IT WAS SOMETHING IN THE TURPENTINE OR A DEFECT INTHE CANVAS BUT THE MORE I SCRUBBED THE MORE THAT GANGRENE SEEMED TOSPREAD. I WORKED LIKE A BEAVER TO GET IT OUT AND YET THE DISEASEAPPEARED TO CREEP FROM LIMB TO LIMB OF THE STUDY BEFORE ME. ALARMED ISTROVE TO ARREST IT BUT NOW THE COLOUR ON THE BREAST CHANGED AND THEWHOLE FIGURE SEEMED TO ABSORB THE INFECTION AS A SPONGE SOAKS UP WATER.VIGOROUSLY I PLIED PALETTEKNIFE TURPENTINE AND SCRAPER THINKING ALLTHE TIME WHAT A SANCE I SHOULD HOLD WITH DUVAL WHO HAD SOLD METHE CANVAS BUT SOON I NOTICED THAT IT WAS NOT THE CANVAS WHICH WASDEFECTIVE NOR YET THE COLOURS OF EDWARD. IT MUST BE THE TURPENTINE ITHOUGHT ANGRILY OR ELSE MY EYES HAVE BECOME SO BLURRED AND CONFUSED BYTHE AFTERNOON LIGHT THAT I CANT SEE STRAIGHT. I CALLED TESSIE THEMODEL. SHE CAME AND LEANED OVER MY CHAIR BLOWING RINGS OF SMOKE INTO THEAIR.WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING TO IT SHE EXCLAIMEDNOTHING I GROWLED IT MUST BE THIS TURPENTINEWHAT A HORRIBLE COLOUR IT IS NOW SHE CONTINUED. DO YOU THINK MY FLESHRESEMBLES GREEN CHEESENO I DONT I SAID ANGRILY DID YOU EVER KNOW ME TO PAINT LIKE THATBEFORENO INDEEDWELL THENIT MUST BE THE TURPENTINE OR SOMETHING SHE ADMITTED.SHE SLIPPED ON A JAPANESE ROBE AND WALKED TO THE WINDOW. I SCRAPED ANDRUBBED UNTIL I WAS TIRED AND FINALLY PICKED UP MY BRUSHES AND HURLEDTHEM THROUGH THE CANVAS WITH A FORCIBLE EXPRESSION THE TONE ALONE OFWHICH REACHED TESSIES EARS.NEVERTHELESS SHE PROMPTLY BEGAN THATS IT SWEAR AND ACT SILLY AND RUINYOUR BRUSHES YOU HAVE BEEN THREE WEEKS ON THAT STUDY AND NOW LOOKWHATS THE GOOD OF RIPPING THE CANVAS WHAT CREATURES ARTISTS AREI FELT ABOUT AS MUCH ASHAMED AS I USUALLY DID AFTER SUCH AN OUTBREAK ANDI TURNED THE RUINED CANVAS TO THE WALL. TESSIE HELPED ME CLEAN MYBRUSHES AND THEN DANCED AWAY TO DRESS. FROM THE SCREEN SHE REGALED MEWITH BITS OF ADVICE CONCERNING WHOLE OR PARTIAL LOSS OF TEMPER UNTILTHINKING PERHAPS I HAD BEEN TORMENTED SUFFICIENTLY SHE CAME OUT TOIMPLORE ME TO BUTTON HER WAIST WHERE SHE COULD NOT REACH IT ON THESHOULDER.EVERYTHING WENT WRONG FROM THE TIME YOU CAME BACK FROM THE WINDOW ANDTALKED ABOUT THAT HORRIDLOOKING MAN YOU SAW IN THE CHURCHYARD SHEANNOUNCED.YES HE PROBABLY BEWITCHED THE PICTURE I SAID YAWNING. I LOOKED AT MYWATCH.ITS AFTER SIX I KNOW SAID TESSIE ADJUSTING HER HAT BEFORE THEMIRROR.YES I REPLIED I DIDNT MEAN TO KEEP YOU SO LONG. I LEANED OUT OFTHE WINDOW BUT RECOILED WITH DISGUST FOR THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE PASTYFACE STOOD BELOW IN THE CHURCHYARD. TESSIE SAW MY GESTURE OF DISAPPROVALAND LEANED FROM THE WINDOW.IS THAT THE MAN YOU DONT LIKE SHE WHISPERED.I NODDED.I CANT SEE HIS FACE BUT HE DOES LOOK FAT AND SOFT. SOMEWAY OR OTHERSHE CONTINUED TURNING TO LOOK AT ME HE REMINDS ME OF A DREAMANAWFUL DREAM I ONCE HAD. OR SHE MUSED LOOKING DOWN AT HER SHAPELYSHOES WAS IT A DREAM AFTER ALLHOW SHOULD I KNOW I SMILED.TESSIE SMILED IN REPLY.YOU WERE IN IT SHE SAID SO PERHAPS YOU MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING ABOUTIT.TESSIE TESSIE I PROTESTED DONT YOU DARE FLATTER BY SAYING THAT YOUDREAM ABOUT MEBUT I DID SHE INSISTED SHALL I TELL YOU ABOUT ITGO AHEAD I REPLIED LIGHTING A CIGARETTE.TESSIE LEANED BACK ON THE OPEN WINDOWSILL AND BEGAN VERY SERIOUSLY.ONE NIGHT LAST WINTER I WAS LYING IN BED THINKING ABOUT NOTHING AT ALLIN PARTICULAR. I HAD BEEN POSING FOR YOU AND I WAS TIRED OUT YET ITSEEMED IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SLEEP. I HEARD THE BELLS IN THE CITY RINGTEN ELEVEN AND MIDNIGHT. I MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP ABOUT MIDNIGHTBECAUSE I DONT REMEMBER HEARING THE BELLS AFTER THAT. IT SEEMED TO METHAT I HAD SCARCELY CLOSED MY EYES WHEN I DREAMED THAT SOMETHING IMPELLEDME TO GO TO THE WINDOW. I ROSE AND RAISING THE SASH LEANED OUT.TWENTYFIFTH STREET WAS DESERTED AS FAR AS I COULD SEE. I BEGAN TO BEAFRAID EVERYTHING OUTSIDE SEEMED SOSO BLACK AND UNCOMFORTABLE. THENTHE SOUND OF WHEELS IN THE DISTANCE CAME TO MY EARS AND IT SEEMED TO MEAS THOUGH THAT WAS WHAT I MUST WAIT FOR. VERY SLOWLY THE WHEELSAPPROACHED AND FINALLY I COULD MAKE OUT A VEHICLE MOVING ALONG THESTREET. IT CAME NEARER AND NEARER AND WHEN IT PASSED BENEATH MY WINDOW ISAW IT WAS A HEARSE. THEN AS I TREMBLED WITH FEAR THE DRIVER TURNED ANDLOOKED STRAIGHT AT ME. WHEN I AWOKE I WAS STANDING BY THE OPEN WINDOWSHIVERING WITH COLD BUT THE BLACKPLUMED HEARSE AND THE DRIVER WEREGONE. I DREAMED THIS DREAM AGAIN IN MARCH LAST AND AGAIN AWOKE BESIDETHE OPEN WINDOW. LAST NIGHT THE DREAM CAME AGAIN. YOU REMEMBER HOW IT WASRAINING WHEN I AWOKE STANDING AT THE OPEN WINDOW MY NIGHTDRESS WASSOAKED.BUT WHERE DID I COME INTO THE DREAM I ASKED.YOUYOU WERE IN THE COFFIN BUT YOU WERE NOT DEAD.IN THE COFFINYES.HOW DID YOU KNOW COULD YOU SEE MENO I ONLY KNEW YOU WERE THERE.HAD YOU BEEN EATING WELSH RAREBITS OR LOBSTER SALAD I BEGANLAUGHING BUT THE GIRL INTERRUPTED ME WITH A FRIGHTENED CRY.HELLO WHATS UP I SAID AS SHE SHRANK INTO THE EMBRASURE BY THEWINDOW.THETHE MAN BELOW IN THE CHURCHYARDHE DROVE THE HEARSE.NONSENSE I SAID BUT TESSIES EYES WERE WIDE WITH TERROR. I WENT TOTHE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT. THE MAN WAS GONE. COME TESSIE I URGEDDONT BE FOOLISH. YOU HAVE POSED TOO LONG YOU ARE NERVOUS.DO YOU THINK I COULD FORGET THAT FACE SHE MURMURED. THREE TIMES I SAWTHE HEARSE PASS BELOW MY WINDOW AND EVERY TIME THE DRIVER TURNED ANDLOOKED UP AT ME. OH HIS FACE WAS SO WHITE ANDAND SOFT IT LOOKEDDEADIT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN DEAD A LONG TIME.I INDUCED THE GIRL TO SIT DOWN AND SWALLOW A GLASS OF MARSALA. THEN I SATDOWN BESIDE HER AND TRIED TO GIVE HER SOME ADVICE.LOOK HERE TESSIE I SAID YOU GO TO THE COUNTRY FOR A WEEK OR TWOAND YOULL HAVE NO MORE DREAMS ABOUT HEARSES.

THEN AGAININSTEAD OF GOING TO BED WHEN YOUR DAYS WORK IS DONE YOU RUN OFF TOPICNICS AT SULZERS PARK OR GO TO THE ELDORADO OR CONEY ISLAND AND WHENYOU COME DOWN HERE NEXT MORNING YOU ARE FAGGED OUT. THERE WAS NO REALHEARSE.

THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT.TESSIE ROSE UNROLLED HER SCENTED HANDKERCHIEF AND TAKING A BIT OF GUMFROM A KNOT IN THE HEM PLACED IT IN HER MOUTH. THEN DRAWING ON HERGLOVES SHE OFFERED ME HER HAND WITH A FRANK GOODNIGHT MR. SCOTTAND WALKED OUT.IITHE NEXT MORNING THOMAS THE BELLBOY BROUGHT ME THE HERALD ANDA BIT OF NEWS. THE CHURCH NEXT DOOR HAD BEEN SOLD.

THEN TOO THERE WAS A FIEND IN HUMAN SHAPEAN ORGANIST WHO REELED OFF SOME OF THE GRAND OLD HYMNS WITH ANINTERPRETATION OF HIS OWN AND I LONGED FOR THE BLOOD OF A CREATURE WHOCOULD PLAY THE DOXOLOGY WITH AN AMENDMENT OF MINOR CHORDS WHICH ONE HEARSONLY IN A QUARTET OF VERY YOUNG UNDERGRADUATES.

E MAIKES ME HILL.WHEN THOMAS HAD GONE I WENT TO THE WINDOW. THE MAN STOOD BESIDE THECHURCHRAILING WITH BOTH HANDS ON THE GATE BUT I HASTILY RETREATED TO MYEASEL AGAIN SICKENED AND HORRIFIED FOR I SAW THAT THE MIDDLE FINGER OFHIS RIGHT HAND WAS MISSING.AT NINE OCLOCK TESSIE APPEARED AND VANISHED BEHIND THE SCREEN WITH AMERRY GOOD MORNING MR. SCOTT. WHEN SHE HAD REAPPEARED AND TAKEN HERPOSE UPON THE MODELSTAND I STARTED A NEW CANVAS MUCH TO HER DELIGHT.SHE REMAINED SILENT AS LONG AS I WAS ON THE DRAWING BUT AS SOON AS THESCRAPE OF THE CHARCOAL CEASED AND I TOOK UP MY FIXATIVE SHE BEGAN TOCHATTER.OH I HAD SUCH A LOVELY TIME LAST NIGHT. WE WENT TO TONY PASTORS.WHO ARE WE I DEMANDED.OH MAGGIE YOU KNOW MR. WHYTES MODEL AND PINKIE MCCORMICKWE CALLHER PINKIE BECAUSE SHES GOT THAT BEAUTIFUL RED HAIR YOU ARTISTS LIKE SOMUCHAND LIZZIE BURKE.I SENT A SHOWER OF SPRAY FROM THE FIXATIVE OVER THE CANVAS AND SAIDWELL GO ON.WE SAW KELLY AND BABY BARNES THE SKIRTDANCER ANDAND ALL THE REST. IMADE A MASH.THEN YOU HAVE GONE BACK ON ME TESSIESHE LAUGHED AND SHOOK HER HEAD.HES LIZZIE BURKES BROTHER ED. HES A PERFECT GENLMAN.I FELT CONSTRAINED TO GIVE HER SOME PARENTAL ADVICE CONCERNING MASHINGWHICH SHE TOOK WITH A BRIGHT SMILE.OH I CAN TAKE CARE OF A STRANGE MASH SHE SAID EXAMINING HER CHEWINGGUM BUT ED IS DIFFERENT. LIZZIE IS MY BEST FRIEND.THEN SHE RELATED HOW ED HAD COME BACK FROM THE STOCKING MILL IN LOWELLMASSACHUSETTS TO FIND HER AND LIZZIE GROWN UP AND WHAT AN ACCOMPLISHEDYOUNG MAN HE WAS AND HOW HE THOUGHT NOTHING OF SQUANDERING HALFADOLLARFOR ICECREAM AND OYSTERS TO CELEBRATE HIS ENTRY AS CLERK INTO THEWOOLLEN DEPARTMENT OF MACYS. BEFORE SHE FINISHED I BEGAN TO PAINT ANDSHE RESUMED THE POSE SMILING AND CHATTERING LIKE A SPARROW. BY NOON IHAD THE STUDY FAIRLY WELL RUBBED IN AND TESSIE CAME TO LOOK AT IT.THATS BETTER SHE SAID.I THOUGHT SO TOO AND ATE MY LUNCH WITH A SATISFIED FEELING THAT ALL WASGOING WELL. TESSIE SPREAD HER LUNCH ON A DRAWING TABLE OPPOSITE ME AND WEDRANK OUR CLARET FROM THE SAME BOTTLE AND LIGHTED OUR CIGARETTES FROM THESAME MATCH. I WAS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO TESSIE. I HAD WATCHED HER SHOOTUP INTO A SLENDER BUT EXQUISITELY FORMED WOMAN FROM A FRAIL AWKWARDCHILD. SHE HAD POSED FOR ME DURING THE LAST THREE YEARS AND AMONG ALL MYMODELS SHE WAS MY FAVOURITE. IT WOULD HAVE TROUBLED ME VERY MUCH INDEEDHAD SHE BECOME TOUGH OR FLY AS THE PHRASE GOES BUT I NEVER NOTICEDANY DETERIORATION OF HER MANNER AND FELT AT HEART THAT SHE WAS ALLRIGHT. SHE AND I NEVER DISCUSSED MORALS AT ALL AND I HAD NO INTENTION OFDOING SO PARTLY BECAUSE I HAD NONE MYSELF AND PARTLY BECAUSE I KNEW SHEWOULD DO WHAT SHE LIKED IN SPITE OF ME. STILL I DID HOPE SHE WOULD STEERCLEAR OF COMPLICATIONS BECAUSE I WISHED HER WELL AND THEN ALSO I HAD ASELFISH DESIRE TO RETAIN THE BEST MODEL I HAD. I KNEW THAT MASHING ASSHE TERMED IT HAD NO SIGNIFICANCE WITH GIRLS LIKE TESSIE AND THAT SUCHTHINGS IN AMERICA DID NOT RESEMBLE IN THE LEAST THE SAME THINGS IN PARIS.YET HAVING LIVED WITH MY EYES OPEN I ALSO KNEW THAT SOMEBODY WOULD TAKETESSIE AWAY SOME DAY IN ONE MANNER OR ANOTHER AND THOUGH I PROFESSED TOMYSELF THAT MARRIAGE WAS NONSENSE I SINCERELY HOPED THAT IN THIS CASETHERE WOULD BE A PRIEST AT THE END OF THE VISTA. I AM A CATHOLIC. WHEN ILISTEN TO HIGH MASS WHEN I SIGN MYSELF I FEEL THAT EVERYTHINGINCLUDING MYSELF IS MORE CHEERFUL AND WHEN I CONFESS IT DOES ME GOOD.A MAN WHO LIVES AS MUCH ALONE AS I DO MUST CONFESS TO SOMEBODY. THENAGAIN SYLVIA WAS CATHOLIC AND IT WAS REASON ENOUGH FOR ME. BUT I WASSPEAKING OF TESSIE WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT. TESSIE ALSO WAS CATHOLIC ANDMUCH MORE DEVOUT THAN I SO TAKING IT ALL IN ALL I HAD LITTLE FEAR FORMY PRETTY MODEL UNTIL SHE SHOULD FALL IN LOVE. BUT THEN I KNEWTHAT FATE ALONE WOULD DECIDE HER FUTURE FOR HER AND I PRAYED INWARDLYTHAT FATE WOULD KEEP HER AWAY FROM MEN LIKE ME AND THROW INTO HER PATHNOTHING BUT ED BURKES AND JIMMY MCCORMICKS BLESS HER SWEET FACETESSIE SAT BLOWING RINGS OF SMOKE UP TO THE CEILING AND TINKLING THE ICEIN HER TUMBLER.DO YOU KNOW THAT I ALSO HAD A DREAM LAST NIGHT I OBSERVED.NOT ABOUT THAT MAN SHE LAUGHED.EXACTLY. A DREAM SIMILAR TO YOURS ONLY MUCH WORSE.IT WAS FOOLISH AND THOUGHTLESS OF ME TO SAY THIS BUT YOU KNOW HOW LITTLETACT THE AVERAGE PAINTER HAS. I MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP ABOUT TENOCLOCK I CONTINUED AND AFTER A WHILE I DREAMT THAT I AWOKE. SOPLAINLY DID I HEAR THE MIDNIGHT BELLS THE WIND IN THE TREEBRANCHES ANDTHE WHISTLE OF STEAMERS FROM THE BAY THAT EVEN NOW I CAN SCARCELYBELIEVE I WAS NOT AWAKE. I SEEMED TO BE LYING IN A BOX WHICH HAD A GLASSCOVER. DIMLY I SAW THE STREET LAMPS AS I PASSED FOR I MUST TELL YOUTESSIE THE BOX IN WHICH I RECLINED APPEARED TO LIE IN A CUSHIONED WAGONWHICH JOLTED ME OVER A STONY PAVEMENT. AFTER A WHILE I BECAME IMPATIENTAND TRIED TO MOVE BUT THE BOX WAS TOO NARROW. MY HANDS WERE CROSSED ONMY BREAST SO I COULD NOT RAISE THEM TO HELP MYSELF. I LISTENED AND THENTRIED TO CALL. MY VOICE WAS GONE. I COULD HEAR THE TRAMPLE OF THE HORSESATTACHED TO THE WAGON AND EVEN THE BREATHING OF THE DRIVER. THEN ANOTHERSOUND BROKE UPON MY EARS LIKE THE RAISING OF A WINDOW SASH. I MANAGED TOTURN MY HEAD A LITTLE AND FOUND I COULD LOOK NOT ONLY THROUGH THE GLASSCOVER OF MY BOX BUT ALSO THROUGH THE GLASS PANES IN THE SIDE OF THECOVERED VEHICLE. I SAW HOUSES EMPTY AND SILENT WITH NEITHER LIGHT NORLIFE ABOUT ANY OF THEM EXCEPTING ONE. IN THAT HOUSE A WINDOW WAS OPEN ONTHE FIRST FLOOR AND A FIGURE ALL IN WHITE STOOD LOOKING DOWN INTO THESTREET. IT WAS YOU.TESSIE HAD TURNED HER FACE AWAY FROM ME AND LEANED ON THE TABLE WITH HERELBOW.I COULD SEE YOUR FACE I RESUMED AND IT SEEMED TO ME TO BE VERYSORROWFUL. THEN WE PASSED ON AND TURNED INTO A NARROW BLACK LANE.PRESENTLY THE HORSES STOPPED. I WAITED AND WAITED CLOSING MY EYES WITHEAR AND IMPATIENCE BUT ALL WAS SILENT AS THE GRAVE. AFTER WHAT SEEMED TOME HOURS I BEGAN TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. A SENSE THAT SOMEBODY WAS CLOSETO ME MADE ME UNCLOSE MY EYES. THEN I SAW THE WHITE FACE OF THEHEARSEDRIVER LOOKING AT ME THROUGH THE COFFINLIDA SOB FROM TESSIE INTERRUPTED ME. SHE WAS TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF. I SAW IHAD MADE AN ASS OF MYSELF AND ATTEMPTED TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE.WHY TESS I SAID I ONLY TOLD YOU THIS TO SHOW YOU WHAT INFLUENCEYOUR STORY MIGHT HAVE ON ANOTHER PERSONS DREAMS. YOU DONT SUPPOSE IREALLY LAY IN A COFFIN DO YOU WHAT ARE YOU TREMBLING FOR DONT YOU SEETHAT YOUR DREAM AND MY UNREASONABLE DISLIKE FOR THAT INOFFENSIVE WATCHMANOF THE CHURCH SIMPLY SET MY BRAIN WORKING AS SOON AS I FELL ASLEEPSHE LAID HER HEAD BETWEEN HER ARMS AND SOBBED AS IF HER HEART WOULDBREAK. WHAT A PRECIOUS TRIPLE DONKEY I HAD MADE OF MYSELF BUT I WASABOUT TO BREAK MY RECORD. I WENT OVER AND PUT MY ARM ABOUT HER.TESSIE DEAR FORGIVE ME I SAID I HAD NO BUSINESS TO FRIGHTEN YOUWITH SUCH NONSENSE. YOU ARE TOO SENSIBLE A GIRL TOO GOOD A CATHOLIC TOBELIEVE IN DREAMS.HER HAND TIGHTENED ON MINE AND HER HEAD FELL BACK UPON MY SHOULDER BUTSHE STILL TREMBLED AND I PETTED HER AND COMFORTED HER.COME TESS OPEN YOUR EYES AND SMILE.HER EYES OPENED WITH A SLOW LANGUID MOVEMENT AND MET MINE BUT THEIREXPRESSION WAS SO QUEER THAT I HASTENED TO REASSURE HER AGAIN.ITS ALL HUMBUG TESSIE YOU SURELY ARE NOT AFRAID THAT ANY HARM WILLCOME TO YOU BECAUSE OF THAT.NO SHE SAID BUT HER SCARLET LIPS QUIVERED.THEN WHATS THE MATTER ARE YOU AFRAIDYES. NOT FOR MYSELF.FOR ME THEN I DEMANDED GAILY.FOR YOU SHE MURMURED IN A VOICE ALMOST INAUDIBLE. II CARE FOR YOU.AT FIRST I STARTED TO LAUGH BUT WHEN I UNDERSTOOD HER A SHOCK PASSEDTHROUGH ME AND I SAT LIKE ONE TURNED TO STONE. THIS WAS THE CROWNING BITOF IDIOCY I HAD COMMITTED. DURING THE MOMENT WHICH ELAPSED BETWEEN HERREPLY AND MY ANSWER I THOUGHT OF A THOUSAND RESPONSES TO THAT INNOCENTCONFESSION. I COULD PASS IT BY WITH A LAUGH I COULD MISUNDERSTAND HERAND ASSURE HER AS TO MY HEALTH I COULD SIMPLY POINT OUT THAT IT WASIMPOSSIBLE SHE COULD LOVE ME. BUT MY REPLY WAS QUICKER THAN MY THOUGHTSAND I MIGHT THINK AND THINK NOW WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE FOR I HAD KISSEDHER ON THE MOUTH.THAT EVENING I TOOK MY USUAL WALK IN WASHINGTON PARK PONDERING OVER THEOCCURRENCES OF THE DAY. I WAS THOROUGHLY COMMITTED. THERE WAS NO BACK OUTNOW AND I STARED THE FUTURE STRAIGHT IN THE FACE. I WAS NOT GOOD NOTEVEN SCRUPULOUS BUT I HAD NO IDEA OF DECEIVING EITHER MYSELF OR TESSIE.THE ONE PASSION OF MY LIFE LAY BURIED IN THE SUNLIT FORESTS OF BRITTANY.WAS IT BURIED FOR EVER HOPE CRIED NO FOR THREE YEARS I HAD BEENLISTENING TO THE VOICE OF HOPE AND FOR THREE YEARS I HAD WAITED FOR AFOOTSTEP ON MY THRESHOLD. HAD SYLVIA FORGOTTEN NO CRIED HOPE.I SAID THAT I WAS NO GOOD. THAT IS TRUE BUT STILL I WAS NOT EXACTLY ACOMIC OPERA VILLAIN. I HAD LED AN EASYGOING RECKLESS LIFE TAKING WHATINVITED ME OF PLEASURE DEPLORING AND SOMETIMES BITTERLY REGRETTINGCONSEQUENCES. IN ONE THING ALONE EXCEPT MY PAINTING WAS I SERIOUS ANDTHAT WAS SOMETHING WHICH LAY HIDDEN IF NOT LOST IN THE BRETON FORESTS.IT WAS TOO LATE FOR ME TO REGRET WHAT HAD OCCURRED DURING THE DAY.WHATEVER IT HAD BEEN PITY A SUDDEN TENDERNESS FOR SORROW OR THE MOREBRUTAL INSTINCT OF GRATIFIED VANITY IT WAS ALL THE SAME NOW AND UNLESSI WISHED TO BRUISE AN INNOCENT HEART MY PATH LAY MARKED BEFORE ME. THEFIRE AND STRENGTH THE DEPTH OF PASSION OF A LOVE WHICH I HAD NEVER EVENSUSPECTED WITH ALL MY IMAGINED EXPERIENCE IN THE WORLD LEFT ME NOALTERNATIVE BUT TO RESPOND OR SEND HER AWAY. WHETHER BECAUSE I AM SOCOWARDLY ABOUT GIVING PAIN TO OTHERS OR WHETHER IT WAS THAT I HAVELITTLE OF THE GLOOMY PURITAN IN ME I DO NOT KNOW BUT I SHRANK FROMDISCLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT THOUGHTLESS KISS AND IN FACT HAD NOTIME TO DO SO BEFORE THE GATES OF HER HEART OPENED AND THE FLOOD POUREDFORTH. OTHERS WHO HABITUALLY DO THEIR DUTY AND FIND A SULLEN SATISFACTIONIN MAKING THEMSELVES AND EVERYBODY ELSE UNHAPPY MIGHT HAVE WITHSTOOD IT.I DID NOT. I DARED NOT. AFTER THE STORM HAD ABATED I DID TELL HER THATSHE MIGHT BETTER HAVE LOVED ED BURKE AND WORN A PLAIN GOLD RING BUT SHEWOULD NOT HEAR OF IT AND I THOUGHT PERHAPS AS LONG AS SHE HAD DECIDED TOLOVE SOMEBODY SHE COULD NOT MARRY IT HAD BETTER BE ME. I AT LEASTCOULD TREAT HER WITH AN INTELLIGENT AFFECTION AND WHENEVER SHE BECAMETIRED OF HER INFATUATION SHE COULD GO NONE THE WORSE FOR IT. FOR I WASDECIDED ON THAT POINT ALTHOUGH I KNEW HOW HARD IT WOULD BE. I REMEMBEREDTHE USUAL TERMINATION OF PLATONIC LIAISONS AND THOUGHT HOW DISGUSTED IHAD BEEN WHENEVER I HEARD OF ONE. I KNEW I WAS UNDERTAKING A GREAT DEALFOR SO UNSCRUPULOUS A MAN AS I WAS AND I DREAMED THE FUTURE BUT NEVERFOR ONE MOMENT DID I DOUBT THAT SHE WAS SAFE WITH ME. HAD IT BEEN ANYBODYBUT TESSIE I SHOULD NOT HAVE BOTHERED MY HEAD ABOUT SCRUPLES. FOR IT DIDNOT OCCUR TO ME TO SACRIFICE TESSIE AS I WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED A WOMAN OFTHE WORLD. I LOOKED THE FUTURE SQUARELY IN THE FACE AND SAW THE SEVERALPROBABLE ENDINGS TO THE AFFAIR. SHE WOULD EITHER TIRE OF THE WHOLE THINGOR BECOME SO UNHAPPY THAT I SHOULD HAVE EITHER TO MARRY HER OR GO AWAY.IF I MARRIED HER WE WOULD BE UNHAPPY. I WITH A WIFE UNSUITED TO ME ANDSHE WITH A HUSBAND UNSUITABLE FOR ANY WOMAN. FOR MY PAST LIFE COULDSCARCELY ENTITLE ME TO MARRY. IF I WENT AWAY SHE MIGHT EITHER FALL ILLRECOVER AND MARRY SOME EDDIE BURKE OR SHE MIGHT RECKLESSLY ORDELIBERATELY GO AND DO SOMETHING FOOLISH. ON THE OTHER HAND IF SHE TIREDOF ME THEN HER WHOLE LIFE WOULD BE BEFORE HER WITH BEAUTIFUL VISTAS OFEDDIE BURKES AND MARRIAGE RINGS AND TWINS AND HARLEM FLATS AND HEAVENKNOWS WHAT. AS I STROLLED ALONG THROUGH THE TREES BY THE WASHINGTON ARCHI DECIDED THAT SHE SHOULD FIND A SUBSTANTIAL FRIEND IN ME ANYWAY ANDTHE FUTURE COULD TAKE CARE OF ITSELF. THEN I WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND PUTON MY EVENING DRESS FOR THE LITTLE FAINTLYPERFUMED NOTE ON MY DRESSERSAID HAVE A CAB AT THE STAGE DOOR AT ELEVEN AND THE NOTE WAS SIGNEDEDITH CARMICHEL METROPOLITAN THEATRE.I TOOK SUPPER THAT NIGHT OR RATHER WE TOOK SUPPER MISS CARMICHEL AND IAT SOLARIS AND THE DAWN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO GILD THE CROSS ON THEMEMORIAL CHURCH AS I ENTERED WASHINGTON SQUARE AFTER LEAVING EDITH AT THEBRUNSWICK. THERE WAS NOT A SOUL IN THE PARK AS I PASSED ALONG THE TREESAND TOOK THE WALK WHICH LEADS FROM THE GARIBALDI STATUE TO THE HAMILTONAPARTMENT HOUSE BUT AS I PASSED THE CHURCHYARD I SAW A FIGURE SITTING ONTHE STONE STEPS. IN SPITE OF MYSELF A CHILL CREPT OVER ME AT THE SIGHT OFTHE WHITE PUFFY FACE AND I HASTENED TO PASS. THEN HE SAID SOMETHINGWHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED TO ME OR MIGHT MERELY HAVE BEEN A MUTTERTO HIMSELF BUT A SUDDEN FURIOUS ANGER FLAMED UP WITHIN ME THAT SUCH ACREATURE SHOULD ADDRESS ME. FOR AN INSTANT I FELT LIKE WHEELING ABOUT ANDSMASHING MY STICK OVER HIS HEAD BUT I WALKED ON AND ENTERING THEHAMILTON WENT TO MY APARTMENT. FOR SOME TIME I TOSSED ABOUT THE BEDTRYING TO GET THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE OUT OF MY EARS BUT COULD NOT. ITFILLED MY HEAD THAT MUTTERING SOUND LIKE THICK OILY SMOKE FROM AFATRENDERING VAT OR AN ODOUR OF NOISOME DECAY. AND AS I LAY AND TOSSEDABOUT THE VOICE IN MY EARS SEEMED MORE DISTINCT AND I BEGAN TOUNDERSTAND THE WORDS HE HAD MUTTERED. THEY CAME TO ME SLOWLY AS IF I HADFORGOTTEN THEM AND AT LAST I COULD MAKE SOME SENSE OUT OF THE SOUNDS. ITWAS THISHAVE YOU FOUND THE YELLOW SIGNHAVE YOU FOUND THE YELLOW SIGNHAVE YOU FOUND THE YELLOW SIGNI WAS FURIOUS. WHAT DID HE MEAN BY THAT THEN WITH A CURSE UPON HIM ANDHIS I ROLLED OVER AND WENT TO SLEEP BUT WHEN I AWOKE LATER I LOOKED PALEAND HAGGARD FOR I HAD DREAMED THE DREAM OF THE NIGHT BEFORE AND ITTROUBLED ME MORE THAN I CARED TO THINK.I DRESSED AND WENT DOWN INTO MY STUDIO. TESSIE SAT BY THE WINDOW BUT ASI CAME IN SHE ROSE AND PUT BOTH ARMS AROUND MY NECK FOR AN INNOCENT KISS.SHE LOOKED SO SWEET AND DAINTY THAT I KISSED HER AGAIN AND THEN SAT DOWNBEFORE THE EASEL.HELLO WHERES THE STUDY I BEGAN YESTERDAY I ASKED.TESSIE LOOKED CONSCIOUS BUT DID NOT ANSWER. I BEGAN TO HUNT AMONG THEPILES OF CANVASES SAYING HURRY UP TESS AND GET READY WE MUST TAKEADVANTAGE OF THE MORNING LIGHT.WHEN AT LAST I GAVE UP THE SEARCH AMONG THE OTHER CANVASES AND TURNED TOLOOK AROUND THE ROOM FOR THE MISSING STUDY I NOTICED TESSIE STANDING BYTHE SCREEN WITH HER CLOTHES STILL ON.WHATS THE MATTER I ASKED DONT YOU FEEL WELLYES.THEN HURRY.DO YOU WANT ME TO POSE ASAS I HAVE ALWAYS POSEDTHEN I UNDERSTOOD. HERE WAS A NEW COMPLICATION. I HAD LOST OF COURSETHE BEST NUDE MODEL I HAD EVER SEEN. I LOOKED AT TESSIE. HER FACE WASSCARLET. ALAS ALAS WE HAD EATEN OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE AND EDEN ANDNATIVE INNOCENCE WERE DREAMS OF THE PASTI MEAN FOR HER.I SUPPOSE SHE NOTICED THE DISAPPOINTMENT ON MY FACE FOR SHE SAID IWILL POSE IF YOU WISH. THE STUDY IS BEHIND THE SCREEN HERE WHERE I PUTIT.NO I SAID WE WILL BEGIN SOMETHING NEW AND I WENT INTO MY WARDROBEAND PICKED OUT A MOORISH COSTUME WHICH FAIRLY BLAZED WITH TINSEL. IT WASA GENUINE COSTUME AND TESSIE RETIRED TO THE SCREEN WITH IT ENCHANTED.WHEN SHE CAME FORTH AGAIN I WAS ASTONISHED. HER LONG BLACK HAIR WAS BOUNDABOVE HER FOREHEAD WITH A CIRCLET OF TURQUOISES AND THE ENDS CURLEDABOUT HER GLITTERING GIRDLE. HER FEET WERE ENCASED IN THE EMBROIDEREDPOINTED SLIPPERS AND THE SKIRT OF HER COSTUME CURIOUSLY WROUGHT WITHARABESQUES IN SILVER FELL TO HER ANKLES. THE DEEP METALLIC BLUE VESTEMBROIDERED WITH SILVER AND THE SHORT MAURESQUE JACKET SPANGLED AND SEWNWITH TURQUOISES BECAME HER WONDERFULLY. SHE CAME UP TO ME AND HELD UP HERFACE SMILING. I SLIPPED MY HAND INTO MY POCKET AND DRAWING OUT A GOLDCHAIN WITH A CROSS ATTACHED DROPPED IT OVER HER HEAD.ITS YOURS TESSIE.MINE SHE FALTERED.YOURS. NOW GO AND POSE THEN WITH A RADIANT SMILE SHE RAN BEHIND THESCREEN AND PRESENTLY REAPPEARED WITH A LITTLE BOX ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN MYNAME.I HAD INTENDED TO GIVE IT TO YOU WHEN I WENT HOME TONIGHT SHE SAIDBUT I CANT WAIT NOW.I OPENED THE BOX. ON THE PINK COTTON INSIDE LAY A CLASP OF BLACK ONYX ONWHICH WAS INLAID A CURIOUS SYMBOL OR LETTER IN GOLD. IT WAS NEITHERARABIC NOR CHINESE NOR AS I FOUND AFTERWARDS DID IT BELONG TO ANYHUMAN SCRIPT.ITS ALL I HAD TO GIVE YOU FOR A KEEPSAKE SHE SAID TIMIDLY.I WAS ANNOYED BUT I TOLD HER HOW MUCH I SHOULD PRIZE IT AND PROMISED TOWEAR IT ALWAYS. SHE FASTENED IT ON MY COAT BENEATH THE LAPEL.HOW FOOLISH TESS TO GO AND BUY ME SUCH A BEAUTIFUL THING AS THIS ISAID.I DID NOT BUY IT SHE LAUGHED.WHERE DID YOU GET ITTHEN SHE TOLD ME HOW SHE HAD FOUND IT ONE DAY WHILE COMING FROM THEAQUARIUM IN THE BATTERY HOW SHE HAD ADVERTISED IT AND WATCHED THEPAPERS BUT AT LAST GAVE UP ALL HOPES OF FINDING THE OWNER.THAT WAS LAST WINTER SHE SAID THE VERY DAY I HAD THE FIRST HORRIDDREAM ABOUT THE HEARSE.I REMEMBERED MY DREAM OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT BUT SAID NOTHING ANDPRESENTLY MY CHARCOAL WAS FLYING OVER A NEW CANVAS AND TESSIE STOODMOTIONLESS ON THE MODELSTAND.IIITHE DAY FOLLOWING WAS A DISASTROUS ONE FOR ME. WHILE MOVING A FRAMEDCANVAS FROM ONE EASEL TO ANOTHER MY FOOT SLIPPED ON THE POLISHED FLOORAND I FELL HEAVILY ON BOTH WRISTS. THEY WERE SO BADLY SPRAINED THAT ITWAS USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO HOLD A BRUSH AND I WAS OBLIGED TO WANDER ABOUTTHE STUDIO GLARING AT UNFINISHED DRAWINGS AND SKETCHES UNTIL DESPAIRSEIZED ME AND I SAT DOWN TO SMOKE AND TWIDDLE MY THUMBS WITH RAGE. THERAIN BLEW AGAINST THE WINDOWS AND RATTLED ON THE ROOF OF THE CHURCHDRIVING ME INTO A NERVOUS FIT WITH ITS INTERMINABLE PATTER. TESSIE SATSEWING BY THE WINDOW AND EVERY NOW AND THEN RAISED HER HEAD AND LOOKEDAT ME WITH SUCH INNOCENT COMPASSION THAT I BEGAN TO FEEL ASHAMED OF MYIRRITATION AND LOOKED ABOUT FOR SOMETHING TO OCCUPY ME. I HAD READ ALLTHE PAPERS AND ALL THE BOOKS IN THE LIBRARY BUT FOR THE SAKE OFSOMETHING TO DO I WENT TO THE BOOKCASES AND SHOVED THEM OPEN WITH MYELBOW. I KNEW EVERY VOLUME BY ITS COLOUR AND EXAMINED THEM ALL PASSINGSLOWLY AROUND THE LIBRARY AND WHISTLING TO KEEP UP MY SPIRITS. I WASTURNING TO GO INTO THE DININGROOM WHEN MY EYE FELL UPON A BOOK BOUND INSERPENT SKIN STANDING IN A CORNER OF THE TOP SHELF OF THE LAST BOOKCASE.I DID NOT REMEMBER IT AND FROM THE FLOOR COULD NOT DECIPHER THE PALELETTERING ON THE BACK SO I WENT TO THE SMOKINGROOM AND CALLED TESSIE.SHE CAME IN FROM THE STUDIO AND CLIMBED UP TO REACH THE BOOK.WHAT IS IT I ASKED.THE KING IN YELLOW.I WAS DUMFOUNDED. WHO HAD PLACED IT THERE HOW CAME IT IN MY ROOMS I HADLONG AGO DECIDED THAT I SHOULD NEVER OPEN THAT BOOK AND NOTHING ON EARTHCOULD HAVE PERSUADED ME TO BUY IT. FEARFUL LEST CURIOSITY MIGHT TEMPT METO OPEN IT I HAD NEVER EVEN LOOKED AT IT IN BOOKSTORES. IF I EVER HADHAD ANY CURIOSITY TO READ IT THE AWFUL TRAGEDY OF YOUNG CASTAIGNE WHOMI KNEW PREVENTED ME FROM EXPLORING ITS WICKED PAGES. I HAD ALWAYSREFUSED TO LISTEN TO ANY DESCRIPTION OF IT AND INDEED NOBODY EVERVENTURED TO DISCUSS THE SECOND PART ALOUD SO I HAD ABSOLUTELY NOKNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THOSE LEAVES MIGHT REVEAL. I STARED AT THE POISONOUSMOTTLED BINDING AS I WOULD AT A SNAKE.DONT TOUCH IT TESSIE I SAID COME DOWN.OF COURSE MY ADMONITION WAS ENOUGH TO AROUSE HER CURIOSITY AND BEFORE ICOULD PREVENT IT SHE TOOK THE BOOK AND LAUGHING DANCED OFF INTO THESTUDIO WITH IT. I CALLED TO HER BUT SHE SLIPPED AWAY WITH A TORMENTINGSMILE AT MY HELPLESS HANDS AND I FOLLOWED HER WITH SOME IMPATIENCE.TESSIE I CRIED ENTERING THE LIBRARY LISTEN I AM SERIOUS. PUT THATBOOK AWAY. I DO NOT WISH YOU TO OPEN IT THE LIBRARY WAS EMPTY. I WENTINTO BOTH DRAWINGROOMS THEN INTO THE BEDROOMS LAUNDRY KITCHEN ANDFINALLY RETURNED TO THE LIBRARY AND BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH. SHE HADHIDDEN HERSELF SO WELL THAT IT WAS HALFANHOUR LATER WHEN I DISCOVEREDHER CROUCHING WHITE AND SILENT BY THE LATTICED WINDOW IN THE STOREROOMABOVE. AT THE FIRST GLANCE I SAW SHE HAD BEEN PUNISHED FOR HERFOOLISHNESS. THE KING IN YELLOW LAY AT HER FEET BUT THE BOOK WASOPEN AT THE SECOND PART. I LOOKED AT TESSIE AND SAW IT WAS TOO LATE. SHEHAD OPENED THE KING IN YELLOW. THEN I TOOK HER BY THE HAND AND LEDHER INTO THE STUDIO. SHE SEEMED DAZED AND WHEN I TOLD HER TO LIE DOWN ONTHE SOFA SHE OBEYED ME WITHOUT A WORD. AFTER A WHILE SHE CLOSED HER EYESAND HER BREATHING BECAME REGULAR AND DEEP BUT I COULD NOT DETERMINEWHETHER OR NOT SHE SLEPT. FOR A LONG WHILE I SAT SILENTLY BESIDE HER BUTSHE NEITHER STIRRED NOR SPOKE AND AT LAST I ROSE AND ENTERING THEUNUSED STOREROOM TOOK THE BOOK IN MY LEAST INJURED HAND. IT SEEMEDHEAVY AS LEAD BUT I CARRIED IT INTO THE STUDIO AGAIN AND SITTING DOWNON THE RUG BESIDE THE SOFA OPENED IT AND READ IT THROUGH FROM BEGINNINGTO END.WHEN FAINT WITH EXCESS OF MY EMOTIONS I DROPPED THE VOLUME AND LEANEDWEARILY BACK AGAINST THE SOFA TESSIE OPENED HER EYES AND LOOKED ATME....WE HAD BEEN SPEAKING FOR SOME TIME IN A DULL MONOTONOUS STRAIN BEFORE IREALIZED THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING THE KING IN YELLOW. OH THE SIN OFWRITING SUCH WORDSWORDS WHICH ARE CLEAR AS CRYSTAL LIMPID AND MUSICALAS BUBBLING SPRINGS WORDS WHICH SPARKLE AND GLOW LIKE THE POISONEDDIAMONDS OF THE MEDICIS OH THE WICKEDNESS THE HOPELESS DAMNATION OF ASOUL WHO COULD FASCINATE AND PARALYZE HUMAN CREATURES WITH SUCHWORDSWORDS UNDERSTOOD BY THE IGNORANT AND WISE ALIKE WORDS WHICH AREMORE PRECIOUS THAN JEWELS MORE SOOTHING THAN MUSIC MORE AWFUL THANDEATHWE TALKED ON UNMINDFUL OF THE GATHERING SHADOWS AND SHE WAS BEGGING METO THROW AWAY THE CLASP OF BLACK ONYX QUAINTLY INLAID WITH WHAT WE NOWKNEW TO BE THE YELLOW SIGN. I NEVER SHALL KNOW WHY I REFUSED THOUGH EVENAT THIS HOUR HERE IN MY BEDROOM AS I WRITE THIS CONFESSION I SHOULD BEGLAD TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT PREVENTED ME FROM TEARING THE YELLOWSIGN FROM MY BREAST AND CASTING IT INTO THE FIRE. I AM SURE I WISHED TODO SO AND YET TESSIE PLEADED WITH ME IN VAIN. NIGHT FELL AND THE HOURSDRAGGED ON BUT STILL WE MURMURED TO EACH OTHER OF THE KING AND THEPALLID MASK AND MIDNIGHT SOUNDED FROM THE MISTY SPIRES IN THEFOGWRAPPED CITY. WE SPOKE OF HASTUR AND OF CASSILDA WHILE OUTSIDE THEFOG ROLLED AGAINST THE BLANK WINDOWPANES AS THE CLOUD WAVES ROLL ANDBREAK ON THE SHORES OF HALI.THE HOUSE WAS VERY SILENT NOW AND NOT A SOUND CAME UP FROM THE MISTYSTREETS. TESSIE LAY AMONG THE CUSHIONS HER FACE A GREY BLOT IN THEGLOOM BUT HER HANDS WERE CLASPED IN MINE AND I KNEW THAT SHE KNEW ANDREAD MY THOUGHTS AS I READ HERS FOR WE HAD UNDERSTOOD THE MYSTERY OF THEHYADES AND THE PHANTOM OF TRUTH WAS LAID. THEN AS WE ANSWERED EACH OTHERSWIFTLY SILENTLY THOUGHT ON THOUGHT THE SHADOWS STIRRED IN THE GLOOMABOUT US AND FAR IN THE DISTANT STREETS WE HEARD A SOUND. NEARER ANDNEARER IT CAME THE DULL CRUNCHING OF WHEELS NEARER AND YET NEARER ANDNOW OUTSIDE BEFORE THE DOOR IT CEASED AND I DRAGGED MYSELF TO THEWINDOW AND SAW A BLACKPLUMED HEARSE. THE GATE BELOW OPENED AND SHUT ANDI CREPT SHAKING TO MY DOOR AND BOLTED IT BUT I KNEW NO BOLTS NO LOCKSCOULD KEEP THAT CREATURE OUT WHO WAS COMING FOR THE YELLOW SIGN. AND NOWI HEARD HIM MOVING VERY SOFTLY ALONG THE HALL. NOW HE WAS AT THE DOORAND THE BOLTS ROTTED AT HIS TOUCH. NOW HE HAD ENTERED. WITH EYES STARTINGFROM MY HEAD I PEERED INTO THE DARKNESS BUT WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ROOM IDID NOT SEE HIM. IT WAS ONLY WHEN I FELT HIM ENVELOPE ME IN HIS COLD SOFTGRASP THAT I CRIED OUT AND STRUGGLED WITH DEADLY FURY BUT MY HANDS WEREUSELESS AND HE TORE THE ONYX CLASP FROM MY COAT AND STRUCK ME FULL IN THEFACE. THEN AS I FELL I HEARD TESSIES SOFT CRY AND HER SPIRIT FLED ANDEVEN WHILE FALLING I LONGED TO FOLLOW HER FOR I KNEW THAT THE KING INYELLOW HAD OPENED HIS TATTERED MANTLE AND THERE WAS ONLY GOD TO CRY TONOW.I COULD TELL MORE BUT I CANNOT SEE WHAT HELP IT WILL BE TO THE WORLD. ASFOR ME I AM PAST HUMAN HELP OR HOPE. AS I LIE HERE WRITING CARELESSEVEN WHETHER OR NOT I DIE BEFORE I FINISH I CAN SEE THE DOCTOR GATHERINGUP HIS POWDERS AND PHIALS WITH A VAGUE GESTURE TO THE GOOD PRIEST BESIDEME WHICH I UNDERSTAND.THEY WILL BE VERY CURIOUS TO KNOW THE TRAGEDYTHEY OF THE OUTSIDE WORLDWHO WRITE BOOKS AND PRINT MILLIONS OF NEWSPAPERS BUT I SHALL WRITE NOMORE AND THE FATHER CONFESSOR WILL SEAL MY LAST WORDS WITH THE SEAL OFSANCTITY WHEN HIS HOLY OFFICE IS DONE. THEY OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD MAY SENDTHEIR CREATURES INTO WRECKED HOMES AND DEATHSMITTEN FIRESIDES AND THEIRNEWSPAPERS WILL BATTEN ON BLOOD AND TEARS BUT WITH ME THEIR SPIES MUSTHALT BEFORE THE CONFESSIONAL. THEY KNOW THAT TESSIE IS DEAD AND THAT I AMDYING. THEY KNOW HOW THE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE AROUSED BY AN INFERNALSCREAM RUSHED INTO MY ROOM AND FOUND ONE LIVING AND TWO DEAD BUT THEYDO NOT KNOW WHAT I SHALL TELL THEM NOW THEY DO NOT KNOW THAT THE DOCTORSAID AS HE POINTED TO A HORRIBLE DECOMPOSED HEAP ON THE FLOORTHE LIVIDCORPSE OF THE WATCHMAN FROM THE CHURCH I HAVE NO THEORY NO EXPLANATION.THAT MAN MUST HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR MONTHSI THINK I AM DYING. I WISH THE PRIEST WOULDTHE DEMOISELLE DYS  MAIS JE CROY QUE JE  SUIS DESCENDU ON PUIZ  TNBREUX ONQUEL DISOIT  HERACLYTUS ESTRE VERET CACHE.THERE BE THREE THINGS WHICH ARE TOO WONDERFUL FOR ME YEA FOUR WHICH IKNOW NOTTHE WAY OF AN EAGLE IN THE AIR THE WAY OF A SERPENT UPON A ROCK THEWAY OF A SHIP IN THE MIDST OF THE SEA AND THE WAY OF A MAN WITH A MAID.ITHE UTTER DESOLATION OF THE SCENE BEGAN TO HAVE ITS EFFECT I SAT DOWN TOFACE THE SITUATION AND IF POSSIBLE RECALL TO MIND SOME LANDMARK WHICHMIGHT AID ME IN EXTRICATING MYSELF FROM MY PRESENT POSITION. IF I COULDONLY FIND THE OCEAN AGAIN ALL WOULD BE CLEAR FOR I KNEW ONE COULD SEETHE ISLAND OF GROIX FROM THE CLIFFS.I LAID DOWN MY GUN AND KNEELING BEHIND A ROCK LIGHTED A PIPE. THEN ILOOKED AT MY WATCH. IT WAS NEARLY FOUR OCLOCK. I MIGHT HAVE WANDERED FARFROM KERSELEC SINCE DAYBREAK.STANDING THE DAY BEFORE ON THE CLIFFS BELOW KERSELEC WITH GOULVENLOOKING OUT OVER THE SOMBRE MOORS AMONG WHICH I HAD NOW LOST MY WAYTHESE DOWNS HAD APPEARED TO ME LEVEL AS A MEADOW STRETCHING TO THEHORIZON AND ALTHOUGH I KNEW HOW DECEPTIVE IS DISTANCE I COULD NOTREALIZE THAT WHAT FROM KERSELEC SEEMED TO BE MERE GRASSY HOLLOWS WEREGREAT VALLEYS COVERED WITH GORSE AND HEATHER AND WHAT LOOKED LIKESCATTERED BOULDERS WERE IN REALITY ENORMOUS CLIFFS OF GRANITE.ITS A BAD PLACE FOR A STRANGER OLD GOULVEN HAD SAID YOUD BETTERTAKE A GUIDE AND I HAD REPLIED I SHALL NOT LOSE MYSELF. NOW I KNEWTHAT I HAD LOST MYSELF AS I SAT THERE SMOKING WITH THE SEAWIND BLOWINGIN MY FACE. ON EVERY SIDE STRETCHED THE MOORLAND COVERED WITH FLOWERINGGORSE AND HEATH AND GRANITE BOULDERS. THERE WAS NOT A TREE IN SIGHT MUCHLESS A HOUSE. AFTER A WHILE I PICKED UP THE GUN AND TURNING MY BACK ONTHE SUN TRAMPED ON AGAIN.THERE WAS LITTLE USE IN FOLLOWING ANY OF THE BRAWLING STREAMS WHICH EVERYNOW AND THEN CROSSED MY PATH FOR INSTEAD OF FLOWING INTO THE SEA THEYRAN INLAND TO REEDY POOLS IN THE HOLLOWS OF THE MOORS. I HAD FOLLOWEDSEVERAL BUT THEY ALL LED ME TO SWAMPS OR SILENT LITTLE PONDS FROM WHICHTHE SNIPE ROSE PEEPING AND WHEELED AWAY IN AN ECSTASY OF FRIGHT I BEGANTO FEEL FATIGUED AND THE GUN GALLED MY SHOULDER IN SPITE OF THE DOUBLEPADS. THE SUN SANK LOWER AND LOWER SHINING LEVEL ACROSS YELLOW GORSE ANDTHE MOORLAND POOLS.AS I WALKED MY OWN GIGANTIC SHADOW LED ME ON SEEMING TO LENGTHEN ATEVERY STEP. THE GORSE SCRAPED AGAINST MY LEGGINGS CRACKLED BENEATH MYFEET SHOWERING THE BROWN EARTH WITH BLOSSOMS AND THE BRAKE BOWED ANDBILLOWED ALONG MY PATH. FROM TUFTS OF HEATH RABBITS SCURRIED AWAY THROUGHTHE BRACKEN AND AMONG THE SWAMP GRASS I HEARD THE WILD DUCKS DROWSYQUACK. ONCE A FOX STOLE ACROSS MY PATH AND AGAIN AS I STOOPED TO DRINKAT A HURRYING RILL A HERON FLAPPED HEAVILY FROM THE REEDS BESIDE ME. ITURNED TO LOOK AT THE SUN. IT SEEMED TO TOUCH THE EDGES OF THE PLAIN.WHEN AT LAST I DECIDED THAT IT WAS USELESS TO GO ON AND THAT I MUST MAKEUP MY MIND TO SPEND AT LEAST ONE NIGHT ON THE MOORS I THREW MYSELF DOWNTHOROUGHLY FAGGED OUT. THE EVENING SUNLIGHT SLANTED WARM ACROSS MY BODYBUT THE SEAWINDS BEGAN TO RISE AND I FELT A CHILL STRIKE THROUGH MEFROM MY WET SHOOTINGBOOTS. HIGH OVERHEAD GULLS WERE WHEELING AND TOSSINGLIKE BITS OF WHITE PAPER FROM SOME DISTANT MARSH A SOLITARY CURLEWCALLED. LITTLE BY LITTLE THE SUN SANK INTO THE PLAIN AND THE ZENITHFLUSHED WITH THE AFTERGLOW. I WATCHED THE SKY CHANGE FROM PALEST GOLD TOPINK AND THEN TO SMOULDERING FIRE. CLOUDS OF MIDGES DANCED ABOVE ME ANDHIGH IN THE CALM AIR A BAT DIPPED AND SOARED. MY EYELIDS BEGAN TO DROOP.THEN AS I SHOOK OFF THE DROWSINESS A SUDDEN CRASH AMONG THE BRACKENROUSED ME. I RAISED MY EYES. A GREAT BIRD HUNG QUIVERING IN THE AIR ABOVEMY FACE. FOR AN INSTANT I STARED INCAPABLE OF MOTION THEN SOMETHINGLEAPED PAST ME IN THE FERNS AND THE BIRD ROSE WHEELED AND PITCHEDHEADLONG INTO THE BRAKE.I WAS ON MY FEET IN AN INSTANT PEERING THROUGH THE GORSE. THERE CAME THESOUND OF A STRUGGLE FROM A BUNCH OF HEATHER CLOSE BY AND THEN ALL WASQUIET. I STEPPED FORWARD MY GUN POISED BUT WHEN I CAME TO THE HEATHERTHE GUN FELL UNDER MY ARM AGAIN AND I STOOD MOTIONLESS IN SILENTASTONISHMENT A DEAD HARE LAY ON THE GROUND AND ON THE HARE STOOD AMAGNIFICENT FALCON ONE TALON BURIED IN THE CREATURES NECK THE OTHERPLANTED FIRMLY ON ITS LIMP FLANK. BUT WHAT ASTONISHED ME WAS NOT THEMERE SIGHT OF A FALCON SITTING UPON ITS PREY. I HAD SEEN THAT MORE THANONCE. IT WAS THAT THE FALCON WAS FITTED WITH A SORT OF LEASH ABOUT BOTHTALONS AND FROM THE LEASH HUNG A ROUND BIT OF METAL LIKE A SLEIGHBELL.THE BIRD TURNED ITS FIERCE YELLOW EYES ON ME AND THEN STOOPED AND STRUCKITS CURVED BEAK INTO THE QUARRY. AT THE SAME INSTANT HURRIED STEPSSOUNDED AMONG THE HEATHER AND A GIRL SPRANG INTO THE COVERT IN FRONT.WITHOUT A GLANCE AT ME SHE WALKED UP TO THE FALCON AND PASSING HERGLOVED HAND UNDER ITS BREAST RAISED IT FROM THE QUARRY. THEN SHE DEFTLYSLIPPED A SMALL HOOD OVER THE BIRDS HEAD AND HOLDING IT OUT ON HERGAUNTLET STOOPED AND PICKED UP THE HARE.SHE PASSED A CORD ABOUT THE ANIMALS LEGS AND FASTENED THE END OF THETHONG TO HER GIRDLE. THEN SHE STARTED TO RETRACE HER STEPS THROUGH THECOVERT AS SHE PASSED ME I RAISED MY CAP AND SHE ACKNOWLEDGED MY PRESENCEWITH A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE INCLINATION. I HAD BEEN SO ASTONISHED SOLOST IN ADMIRATION OF THE SCENE BEFORE MY EYES THAT IT HAD NOT OCCURREDTO ME THAT HERE WAS MY SALVATION. BUT AS SHE MOVED AWAY I RECOLLECTEDTHAT UNLESS I WANTED TO SLEEP ON A WINDY MOOR THAT NIGHT I HAD BETTERRECOVER MY SPEECH WITHOUT DELAY. AT MY FIRST WORD SHE HESITATED AND AS ISTEPPED BEFORE HER I THOUGHT A LOOK OF FEAR CAME INTO HER BEAUTIFUL EYES.BUT AS I HUMBLY EXPLAINED MY UNPLEASANT PLIGHT HER FACE FLUSHED AND SHELOOKED AT ME IN WONDER.SURELY YOU DID NOT COME FROM KERSELEC SHE REPEATED.HER SWEET VOICE HAD NO TRACE OF THE BRETON ACCENT NOR OF ANY ACCENT WHICHI KNEW AND YET THERE WAS SOMETHING IN IT I SEEMED TO HAVE HEARD BEFORESOMETHING QUAINT AND INDEFINABLE LIKE THE THEME OF AN OLD SONG.I EXPLAINED THAT I WAS AN AMERICAN UNACQUAINTED WITH FINISTRE SHOOTINGTHERE FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT.AN AMERICAN SHE REPEATED IN THE SAME QUAINT MUSICAL TONES. I HAVENEVER BEFORE SEEN AN AMERICAN.FOR A MOMENT SHE STOOD SILENT THEN LOOKING AT ME SHE SAID. IF YOUSHOULD WALK ALL NIGHT YOU COULD NOT REACH KERSELEC NOW EVEN IF YOU HAD AGUIDE.THIS WAS PLEASANT NEWS.BUT I BEGAN IF I COULD ONLY FIND A PEASANTS HUT WHERE I MIGHT GETSOMETHING TO EAT AND SHELTER.THE FALCON ON HER WRIST FLUTTERED AND SHOOK ITS HEAD. THE GIRL SMOOTHEDITS GLOSSY BACK AND GLANCED AT ME.LOOK AROUND SHE SAID GENTLY. CAN YOU SEE THE END OF THESE MOORSLOOK NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST. CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING BUT MOORLAND ANDBRACKENNO I SAID.THE MOOR IS WILD AND DESOLATE. IT IS EASY TO ENTER BUT SOMETIMES THEYWHO ENTER NEVER LEAVE IT. THERE ARE NO PEASANTS HUTS HERE.WELL I SAID IF YOU WILL TELL ME IN WHICH DIRECTION KERSELEC LIESTOMORROW IT WILL TAKE ME NO LONGER TO GO BACK THAN IT HAS TO COME.SHE LOOKED AT ME AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION ALMOST LIKE PITY.AH SHE SAID TO COME IS EASY AND TAKES HOURS TO GO IS DIFFERENTANDMAY TAKE CENTURIES.I STARED AT HER IN AMAZEMENT BUT DECIDED THAT I HAD MISUNDERSTOOD HER.THEN BEFORE I HAD TIME TO SPEAK SHE DREW A WHISTLE FROM HER BELT ANDSOUNDED IT.SIT DOWN AND REST SHE SAID TO ME YOU HAVE COME A LONG DISTANCE ANDARE TIRED.SHE GATHERED UP HER PLEATED SKIRTS AND MOTIONING ME TO FOLLOW PICKED HERDAINTY WAY THROUGH THE GORSE TO A FLAT ROCK AMONG THE FERNS.THEY WILL BE HERE DIRECTLY SHE SAID AND TAKING A SEAT AT ONE END OFTHE ROCK INVITED ME TO SIT DOWN ON THE OTHER EDGE. THE AFTERGLOW WASBEGINNING TO FADE IN THE SKY AND A SINGLE STAR TWINKLED FAINTLY THROUGHTHE ROSY HAZE. A LONG WAVERING TRIANGLE OF WATERFOWL DRIFTED SOUTHWARDOVER OUR HEADS AND FROM THE SWAMPS AROUND PLOVER WERE CALLING.THEY ARE VERY BEAUTIFULTHESE MOORS SHE SAID QUIETLY.BEAUTIFUL BUT CRUEL TO STRANGERS I ANSWERED.BEAUTIFUL AND CRUEL SHE REPEATED DREAMILY BEAUTIFUL AND CRUEL.LIKE A WOMAN I SAID STUPIDLY.OH SHE CRIED WITH A LITTLE CATCH IN HER BREATH AND LOOKED AT ME. HERDARK EYES MET MINE AND I THOUGHT SHE SEEMED ANGRY OR FRIGHTENED.LIKE A WOMAN SHE REPEATED UNDER HER BREATH HOW CRUEL TO SAY SOTHEN AFTER A PAUSE AS THOUGH SPEAKING ALOUD TO HERSELF HOW CRUEL FORHIM TO SAY THATI DONT KNOW WHAT SORT OF AN APOLOGY I OFFERED FOR MY INANE THOUGHHARMLESS SPEECH BUT I KNOW THAT SHE SEEMED SO TROUBLED ABOUT IT THAT IBEGAN TO THINK I HAD SAID SOMETHING VERY DREADFUL WITHOUT KNOWING IT ANDREMEMBERED WITH HORROR THE PITFALLS AND SNARES WHICH THE FRENCH LANGUAGESETS FOR FOREIGNERS. WHILE I WAS TRYING TO IMAGINE WHAT I MIGHT HAVESAID A SOUND OF VOICES CAME ACROSS THE MOOR AND THE GIRL ROSE TO HERFEET.NO SHE SAID WITH A TRACE OF A SMILE ON HER PALE FACE I WILL NOTACCEPT YOUR APOLOGIES MONSIEUR BUT I MUST PROVE YOU WRONG AND THATSHALL BE MY REVENGE. LOOK. HERE COME HASTUR AND RAOUL.TWO MEN LOOMED UP IN THE TWILIGHT. ONE HAD A SACK ACROSS HIS SHOULDERSAND THE OTHER CARRIED A HOOP BEFORE HIM AS A WAITER CARRIES A TRAY. THEHOOP WAS FASTENED WITH STRAPS TO HIS SHOULDERS AND AROUND THE EDGE OFTHE CIRCLET SAT THREE HOODED FALCONS FITTED WITH TINKLING BELLS. THE GIRLSTEPPED UP TO THE FALCONER AND WITH A QUICK TURN OF HER WRISTTRANSFERRED HER FALCON TO THE HOOP WHERE IT QUICKLY SIDLED OFF ANDNESTLED AMONG ITS MATES WHO SHOOK THEIR HOODED HEADS AND RUFFLED THEIRFEATHERS TILL THE BELLED JESSES TINKLED AGAIN. THE OTHER MAN STEPPEDFORWARD AND BOWING RESPECTFULLY TOOK UP THE HARE AND DROPPED IT INTO THEGAMESACK.THESE ARE MY PIQUEURS SAID THE GIRL TURNING TO ME WITH A GENTLEDIGNITY. RAOUL IS A GOOD FAUCONNIER AND I SHALL SOME DAY MAKE HIM GRANDVENEUR. HASTUR IS INCOMPARABLE.THE TWO SILENT MEN SALUTED ME RESPECTFULLY.DID I NOT TELL YOU MONSIEUR THAT I SHOULD PROVE YOU WRONG SHECONTINUED. THIS THEN IS MY REVENGE THAT YOU DO ME THE COURTESY OFACCEPTING FOOD AND SHELTER AT MY OWN HOUSE.BEFORE I COULD ANSWER SHE SPOKE TO THE FALCONERS WHO STARTED INSTANTLYACROSS THE HEATH AND WITH A GRACIOUS GESTURE TO ME SHE FOLLOWED. I DONTKNOW WHETHER I MADE HER UNDERSTAND HOW PROFOUNDLY GRATEFUL I FELT BUTSHE SEEMED PLEASED TO LISTEN AS WE WALKED OVER THE DEWY HEATHER.ARE YOU NOT VERY TIRED SHE ASKED.I HAD CLEAN FORGOTTEN MY FATIGUE IN HER PRESENCE AND I TOLD HER SO.DONT YOU THINK YOUR GALLANTRY IS A LITTLE OLDFASHIONED SHE SAID ANDWHEN I LOOKED CONFUSED AND HUMBLED SHE ADDED QUIETLY OH I LIKE IT ILIKE EVERYTHING OLDFASHIONED AND IT IS DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR YOU SAY SUCHPRETTY THINGS.THE MOORLAND AROUND US WAS VERY STILL NOW UNDER ITS GHOSTLY SHEET OFMIST. THE PLOVERS HAD CEASED THEIR CALLING THE CRICKETS AND ALL THELITTLE CREATURES OF THE FIELDS WERE SILENT AS WE PASSED YET IT SEEMED TOME AS IF I COULD HEAR THEM BEGINNING AGAIN FAR BEHIND US. WELL INADVANCE THE TWO TALL FALCONERS STRODE ACROSS THE HEATHER AND THE FAINTJINGLING OF THE HAWKS BELLS CAME TO OUR EARS IN DISTANT MURMURINGCHIMES.SUDDENLY A SPLENDID HOUND DASHED OUT OF THE MIST IN FRONT FOLLOWED BYANOTHER AND ANOTHER UNTIL HALFADOZEN OR MORE WERE BOUNDING AND LEAPINGAROUND THE GIRL BESIDE ME. SHE CARESSED AND QUIETED THEM WITH HER GLOVEDHAND SPEAKING TO THEM IN QUAINT TERMS WHICH I REMEMBERED TO HAVE SEEN INOLD FRENCH MANUSCRIPTS.THEN THE FALCONS ON THE CIRCLET BORNE BY THE FALCONER AHEAD BEGAN TO BEATTHEIR WINGS AND SCREAM AND FROM SOMEWHERE OUT OF SIGHT THE NOTES OF AHUNTINGHORN FLOATED ACROSS THE MOOR. THE HOUNDS SPRANG AWAY BEFORE USAND VANISHED IN THE TWILIGHT THE FALCONS FLAPPED AND SQUEALED UPON THEIRPERCH AND THE GIRL TAKING UP THE SONG OF THE HORN BEGAN TO HUM. CLEARAND MELLOW HER VOICE SOUNDED IN THE NIGHT AIR.  CHASSEUR CHASSEUR CHASSEZ ENCORE  QUITTEZ ROSETTE ET JEANNETON  TONTON TONTON TONTAINE TONTON  OU POUR RABATTRE DS LAURORE  QUE LES AMOURS SOIENT DE PLANTON  TONTON TONTAINE TONTON.AS I LISTENED TO HER LOVELY VOICE A GREY MASS WHICH RAPIDLY GREW MOREDISTINCT LOOMED UP IN FRONT AND THE HORN RANG OUT JOYOUSLY THROUGH THETUMULT OF THE HOUNDS AND FALCONS. A TORCH GLIMMERED AT A GATE A LIGHTSTREAMED THROUGH AN OPENING DOOR AND WE STEPPED UPON A WOODEN BRIDGEWHICH TREMBLED UNDER OUR FEET AND ROSE CREAKING AND STRAINING BEHIND USAS WE PASSED OVER THE MOAT AND INTO A SMALL STONE COURT WALLED ON EVERYSIDE. FROM AN OPEN DOORWAY A MAN CAME AND BENDING IN SALUTATIONPRESENTED A CUP TO THE GIRL BESIDE ME. SHE TOOK THE CUP AND TOUCHED ITWITH HER LIPS THEN LOWERING IT TURNED TO ME AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE IBID YOU WELCOME.AT THAT MOMENT ONE OF THE FALCONERS CAME WITH ANOTHER CUP BUT BEFOREHANDING IT TO ME PRESENTED IT TO THE GIRL WHO TASTED IT. THE FALCONERMADE A GESTURE TO RECEIVE IT BUT SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THENSTEPPING FORWARD OFFERED ME THE CUP WITH HER OWN HANDS. I FELT THIS TOBE AN ACT OF EXTRAORDINARY GRACIOUSNESS BUT HARDLY KNEW WHAT WASEXPECTED OF ME AND DID NOT RAISE IT TO MY LIPS AT ONCE. THE GIRL FLUSHEDCRIMSON. I SAW THAT I MUST ACT QUICKLY.MADEMOISELLE I FALTERED A STRANGER WHOM YOU HAVE SAVED FROM DANGERSHE MAY NEVER REALIZE EMPTIES THIS CUP TO THE GENTLEST AND LOVELIESTHOSTESS OF FRANCE.IN HIS NAME SHE MURMURED CROSSING HERSELF AS I DRAINED THE CUP. THENSTEPPING INTO THE DOORWAY SHE TURNED TO ME WITH A PRETTY GESTURE ANDTAKING MY HAND IN HERS LED ME INTO THE HOUSE SAYING AGAIN AND AGAINYOU ARE VERY WELCOME INDEED YOU ARE WELCOME TO THE CHTEAU DYS.III AWOKE NEXT MORNING WITH THE MUSIC OF THE HORN IN MY EARS AND LEAPINGOUT OF THE ANCIENT BED WENT TO A CURTAINED WINDOW WHERE THE SUNLIGHTFILTERED THROUGH LITTLE DEEPSET PANES. THE HORN CEASED AS I LOOKED INTOTHE COURT BELOW.A MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROTHER TO THE TWO FALCONERS OF THE NIGHTBEFORE STOOD IN THE MIDST OF A PACK OF HOUNDS. A CURVED HORN WAS STRAPPEDOVER HIS BACK AND IN HIS HAND HE HELD A LONGLASHED WHIP. THE DOGSWHINED AND YELPED DANCING AROUND HIM IN ANTICIPATION THERE WAS THESTAMP OF HORSES TOO IN THE WALLED YARD.MOUNT CRIED A VOICE IN BRETON AND WITH A CLATTER OF HOOFS THE TWOFALCONERS WITH FALCONS UPON THEIR WRISTS RODE INTO THE COURTYARD AMONGTHE HOUNDS. THEN I HEARD ANOTHER VOICE WHICH SENT THE BLOOD THROBBINGTHROUGH MY HEART PIRIOU LOUIS HUNT THE HOUNDS WELL AND SPARE NEITHERSPUR NOR WHIP. THOU RAOUL AND THOU GASTON SEE THAT THE EPERVIERDOES NOT PROVE HIMSELF NIAIS AND IF IT BE BEST IN YOUR JUDGMENTFAITES COURTOISIE  LOISEAU. JARDINER UN OISEAU LIKE THEMU THERE ON HASTURS WRIST IS NOT DIFFICULT BUT THOU RAOULMAYEST NOT FIND IT SO SIMPLE TO GOVERN THAT HAGARD. TWICE LASTWEEK HE FOAMED AU VIF AND LOST THE BECCADE ALTHOUGH HE ISUSED TO THE LEURRE. THE BIRD ACTS LIKE A STUPID BRANCHIER.PATRE UN HAGARD NEST PAS SI FACILE.WAS I DREAMING THE OLD LANGUAGE OF FALCONRY WHICH I HAD READ IN YELLOWMANUSCRIPTSTHE OLD FORGOTTEN FRENCH OF THE MIDDLE AGES WAS SOUNDING INMY EARS WHILE THE HOUNDS BAYED AND THE HAWKS BELLS TINKLED ACCOMPANIMENTTO THE STAMPING HORSES. SHE SPOKE AGAIN IN THE SWEET FORGOTTEN LANGUAGEIF YOU WOULD RATHER ATTACH THE LONGE AND LEAVE THY HAGARD AUBLOC RAOUL I SHALL SAY NOTHING FOR IT WERE A PITY TO SPOIL SO FAIRA DAYS SPORT WITH AN ILLTRAINED SORS. ESSIMER ABAISSERIT ISPOSSIBLY THE BEST WAY. A LUI DONNERA DES REINS. I WAS PERHAPS HASTYWITH THE BIRD. IT TAKES TIME TO PASS  LA FILIRE AND THE EXERCISESDESCAP.THEN THE FALCONER RAOUL BOWED IN HIS STIRRUPS AND REPLIED IF IT BE THEPLEASURE OF MADEMOISELLE I SHALL KEEP THE HAWK.IT IS MY WISH SHE ANSWERED. FALCONRY I KNOW BUT YOU HAVE YET TO GIVEME MANY A LESSON IN AUTOURSERIE MY POOR RAOUL. SIEUR PIRIOU LOUISMOUNTTHE HUNTSMAN SPRANG INTO AN ARCHWAY AND IN AN INSTANT RETURNED MOUNTEDUPON A STRONG BLACK HORSE FOLLOWED BY A PIQUEUR ALSO MOUNTED.AH SHE CRIED JOYOUSLY SPEED GLEMAREC REN SPEED SPEED ALL SOUNDTHY HORN SIEUR PIRIOUTHE SILVERY MUSIC OF THE HUNTINGHORN FILLED THE COURTYARD THE HOUNDSSPRANG THROUGH THE GATEWAY AND GALLOPING HOOFBEATS PLUNGED OUT OF THEPAVED COURT LOUD ON THE DRAWBRIDGE SUDDENLY MUFFLED THEN LOST IN THEHEATHER AND BRACKEN OF THE MOORS. DISTANT AND MORE DISTANT SOUNDED THEHORN UNTIL IT BECAME SO FAINT THAT THE SUDDEN CAROL OF A SOARING LARKDROWNED IT IN MY EARS. I HEARD THE VOICE BELOW RESPONDING TO SOME CALLFROM WITHIN THE HOUSE.I DO NOT REGRET THE CHASE I WILL GO ANOTHER TIME COURTESY TO THESTRANGER PELAGIE REMEMBERAND A FEEBLE VOICE CAME QUAVERING FROM WITHIN THE HOUSECOURTOISIE.I STRIPPED AND RUBBED MYSELF FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN THE HUGE EARTHEN BASINOF ICY WATER WHICH STOOD UPON THE STONE FLOOR AT THE FOOT OF MY BED. THENI LOOKED ABOUT FOR MY CLOTHES. THEY WERE GONE BUT ON A SETTLE NEAR THEDOOR LAY A HEAP OF GARMENTS WHICH I INSPECTED WITH ASTONISHMENT. AS MYCLOTHES HAD VANISHED I WAS COMPELLED TO ATTIRE MYSELF IN THE COSTUMEWHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN PLACED THERE FOR ME TO WEAR WHILE MY OWN CLOTHESDRIED. EVERYTHING WAS THERE CAP SHOES AND HUNTING DOUBLET OF SILVERYGREY HOMESPUN BUT THE CLOSEFITTING COSTUME AND SEAMLESS SHOES BELONGEDTO ANOTHER CENTURY AND I REMEMBERED THE STRANGE COSTUMES OF THE THREEFALCONERS IN THE COURTYARD. I WAS SURE THAT IT WAS NOT THE MODERN DRESSOF ANY PORTION OF FRANCE OR BRITTANY BUT NOT UNTIL I WAS DRESSED ANDSTOOD BEFORE A MIRROR BETWEEN THE WINDOWS DID I REALIZE THAT I WASCLOTHED MUCH MORE LIKE A YOUNG HUNTSMAN OF THE MIDDLE AGES THAN LIKE ABRETON OF THAT DAY. I HESITATED AND PICKED UP THE CAP. SHOULD I GO DOWNAND PRESENT MYSELF IN THAT STRANGE GUISE THERE SEEMED TO BE NO HELP FORIT MY OWN CLOTHES WERE GONE AND THERE WAS NO BELL IN THE ANCIENT CHAMBERTO CALL A SERVANT SO I CONTENTED MYSELF WITH REMOVING A SHORT HAWKSFEATHER FROM THE CAP AND OPENING THE DOOR WENT DOWNSTAIRS.BY THE FIREPLACE IN THE LARGE ROOM AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS AN OLDBRETON WOMAN SAT SPINNING WITH A DISTAFF. SHE LOOKED UP AT ME WHEN IAPPEARED AND SMILING FRANKLY WISHED ME HEALTH IN THE BRETON LANGUAGETO WHICH I LAUGHINGLY REPLIED IN FRENCH. AT THE SAME MOMENT MY HOSTESSAPPEARED AND RETURNED MY SALUTATION WITH A GRACE AND DIGNITY THAT SENT ATHRILL TO MY HEART. HER LOVELY HEAD WITH ITS DARK CURLY HAIR WAS CROWNEDWITH A HEADDRESS WHICH SET ALL DOUBTS AS TO THE EPOCH OF MY OWN COSTUMEAT REST. HER SLENDER FIGURE WAS EXQUISITELY SET OFF IN THE HOMESPUNHUNTINGGOWN EDGED WITH SILVER AND ON HER GAUNTLETCOVERED WRIST SHEBORE ONE OF HER PETTED HAWKS. WITH PERFECT SIMPLICITY SHE TOOK MY HANDAND LED ME INTO THE GARDEN IN THE COURT AND SEATING HERSELF BEFORE ATABLE INVITED ME VERY SWEETLY TO SIT BESIDE HER. THEN SHE ASKED ME IN HERSOFT QUAINT ACCENT HOW I HAD PASSED THE NIGHT AND WHETHER I WAS VERYMUCH INCONVENIENCED BY WEARING THE CLOTHES WHICH OLD PELAGIE HAD PUTTHERE FOR ME WHILE I SLEPT. I LOOKED AT MY OWN CLOTHES AND SHOES DRYINGIN THE SUN BY THE GARDENWALL AND HATED THEM. WHAT HORRORS THEY WERECOMPARED WITH THE GRACEFUL COSTUME WHICH I NOW WORE I TOLD HER THISLAUGHING BUT SHE AGREED WITH ME VERY SERIOUSLY.WE WILL THROW THEM AWAY SHE SAID IN A QUIET VOICE. IN MY ASTONISHMENTI ATTEMPTED TO EXPLAIN THAT I NOT ONLY COULD NOT THINK OF ACCEPTINGCLOTHES FROM ANYBODY ALTHOUGH FOR ALL I KNEW IT MIGHT BE THE CUSTOM OFHOSPITALITY IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY BUT THAT I SHOULD CUT ANIMPOSSIBLE FIGURE IF I RETURNED TO FRANCE CLOTHED AS I WAS THEN.SHE LAUGHED AND TOSSED HER PRETTY HEAD SAYING SOMETHING IN OLD FRENCHWHICH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND AND THEN PELAGIE TROTTED OUT WITH A TRAY ONWHICH STOOD TWO BOWLS OF MILK A LOAF OF WHITE BREAD FRUIT A PLATTER OFHONEYCOMB AND A FLAGON OF DEEP RED WINE. YOU SEE I HAVE NOT YET BROKENMY FAST BECAUSE I WISHED YOU TO EAT WITH ME. BUT I AM VERY HUNGRY SHESMILED.I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN FORGET ONE WORD OF WHAT YOU HAVE SAID IBLURTED OUT WHILE MY CHEEKS BURNED. SHE WILL THINK ME MAD I ADDED TOMYSELF BUT SHE TURNED TO ME WITH SPARKLING EYES.AH SHE MURMURED. THEN MONSIEUR KNOWS ALL THAT THERE IS OF CHIVALRYSHE CROSSED HERSELF AND BROKE BREAD. I SAT AND WATCHED HER WHITE HANDSNOT DARING TO RAISE MY EYES TO HERS.WILL YOU NOT EAT SHE ASKED. WHY DO YOU LOOK SO TROUBLEDAH WHY I KNEW IT NOW. I KNEW I WOULD GIVE MY LIFE TO TOUCH WITH MY LIPSTHOSE ROSY PALMSI UNDERSTOOD NOW THAT FROM THE MOMENT WHEN I LOOKEDINTO HER DARK EYES THERE ON THE MOOR LAST NIGHT I HAD LOVED HER. MY GREATAND SUDDEN PASSION HELD ME SPEECHLESS.ARE YOU ILL AT EASE SHE ASKED AGAIN.THEN LIKE A MAN WHO PRONOUNCES HIS OWN DOOM I ANSWERED IN A LOW VOICEYES I AM ILL AT EASE FOR LOVE OF YOU. AND AS SHE DID NOT STIR NORANSWER THE SAME POWER MOVED MY LIPS IN SPITE OF ME AND I SAID I WHOAM UNWORTHY OF THE LIGHTEST OF YOUR THOUGHTS I WHO ABUSE HOSPITALITY ANDREPAY YOUR GENTLE COURTESY WITH BOLD PRESUMPTION I LOVE YOU.SHE LEANED HER HEAD UPON HER HANDS AND ANSWERED SOFTLY I LOVE YOU.YOUR WORDS ARE VERY DEAR TO ME. I LOVE YOU.THEN I SHALL WIN YOU.WIN ME SHE REPLIED.BUT ALL THE TIME I HAD BEEN SITTING SILENT MY FACE TURNED TOWARD HER.SHE ALSO SILENT HER SWEET FACE RESTING ON HER UPTURNED PALM SAT FACINGME AND AS HER EYES LOOKED INTO MINE I KNEW THAT NEITHER SHE NOR I HADSPOKEN HUMAN SPEECH BUT I KNEW THAT HER SOUL HAD ANSWERED MINE AND IDREW MYSELF UP FEELING YOUTH AND JOYOUS LOVE COURSING THROUGH EVERY VEIN.SHE WITH A BRIGHT COLOUR IN HER LOVELY FACE SEEMED AS ONE AWAKENED FROMA DREAM AND HER EYES SOUGHT MINE WITH A QUESTIONING GLANCE WHICH MADE METREMBLE WITH DELIGHT. WE BROKE OUR FAST SPEAKING OF OURSELVES. I TOLDHER MY NAME AND SHE TOLD ME HERS THE DEMOISELLE JEANNE DYS.SHE SPOKE OF HER FATHER AND MOTHERS DEATH AND HOW THE NINETEEN OF HERYEARS HAD BEEN PASSED IN THE LITTLE FORTIFIED FARM ALONE WITH HER NURSEPELAGIE GLEMAREC REN THE PIQUEUR AND THE FOUR FALCONERS RAOULGASTON HASTUR AND THE SIEUR PIRIOU LOUIS WHO HAD SERVED HER FATHER.SHE HAD NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE THE MOORLANDNEVER EVEN HAD SEEN A HUMAN SOULBEFORE EXCEPT THE FALCONERS AND PELAGIE. SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW SHE HADHEARD OF KERSELEC PERHAPS THE FALCONERS HAD SPOKEN OF IT. SHE KNEW THELEGENDS OF LOUP GAROU AND JEANNE LA FLAMME FROM HER NURSE PELAGIE. SHEEMBROIDERED AND SPUN FLAX. HER HAWKS AND HOUNDS WERE HER ONLYDISTRACTION. WHEN SHE HAD MET ME THERE ON THE MOOR SHE HAD BEEN SOFRIGHTENED THAT SHE ALMOST DROPPED AT THE SOUND OF MY VOICE. SHE HAD ITWAS TRUE SEEN SHIPS AT SEA FROM THE CLIFFS BUT AS FAR AS THE EYE COULDREACH THE MOORS OVER WHICH SHE GALLOPED WERE DESTITUTE OF ANY SIGN OFHUMAN LIFE. THERE WAS A LEGEND WHICH OLD PELAGIE TOLD HOW ANYBODY ONCELOST IN THE UNEXPLORED MOORLAND MIGHT NEVER RETURN BECAUSE THE MOORSWERE ENCHANTED. SHE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER IT WAS TRUE SHE NEVER HADTHOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL SHE MET ME. SHE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THE FALCONERSHAD EVEN BEEN OUTSIDE OR WHETHER THEY COULD GO IF THEY WOULD. THE BOOKSIN THE HOUSE WHICH PELAGIE THE NURSE HAD TAUGHT HER TO READ WEREHUNDREDS OF YEARS OLD.ALL THIS SHE TOLD ME WITH A SWEET SERIOUSNESS SELDOM SEEN IN ANY ONE BUTCHILDREN. MY OWN NAME SHE FOUND EASY TO PRONOUNCE AND INSISTED BECAUSEMY FIRST NAME WAS PHILIP I MUST HAVE FRENCH BLOOD IN ME. SHE DID NOTSEEM CURIOUS TO LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND I THOUGHTPERHAPS SHE CONSIDERED IT HAD FORFEITED HER INTEREST AND RESPECT FROM THESTORIES OF HER NURSE.WE WERE STILL SITTING AT THE TABLE AND SHE WAS THROWING GRAPES TO THESMALL FIELD BIRDS WHICH CAME FEARLESSLY TO OUR VERY FEET.I BEGAN TO SPEAK IN A VAGUE WAY OF GOING BUT SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF ITAND BEFORE I KNEW IT I HAD PROMISED TO STAY A WEEK AND HUNT WITH HAWK ANDHOUND IN THEIR COMPANY. I ALSO OBTAINED PERMISSION TO COME AGAIN FROMKERSELEC AND VISIT HER AFTER MY RETURN.WHY SHE SAID INNOCENTLY I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO IF YOU NEVERCAME BACK AND I KNOWING THAT I HAD NO RIGHT TO AWAKEN HER WITH THESUDDEN SHOCK WHICH THE AVOWAL OF MY OWN LOVE WOULD BRING TO HER SATSILENT HARDLY DARING TO BREATHE.YOU WILL COME VERY OFTEN SHE ASKED.VERY OFTEN I SAID.EVERY DAYEVERY DAY.OH SHE SIGHED I AM VERY HAPPY. COME AND SEE MY HAWKS.SHE ROSE AND TOOK MY HAND AGAIN WITH A CHILDLIKE INNOCENCE OF POSSESSIONAND WE WALKED THROUGH THE GARDEN AND FRUIT TREES TO A GRASSY LAWN WHICHWAS BORDERED BY A BROOK. OVER THE LAWN WERE SCATTERED FIFTEEN OR TWENTYSTUMPS OF TREESPARTIALLY IMBEDDED IN THE GRASSAND UPON ALL OF THESEEXCEPT TWO SAT FALCONS. THEY WERE ATTACHED TO THE STUMPS BY THONGS WHICHWERE IN TURN FASTENED WITH STEEL RIVETS TO THEIR LEGS JUST ABOVE THETALONS. A LITTLE STREAM OF PURE SPRING WATER FLOWED IN A WINDING COURSEWITHIN EASY DISTANCE OF EACH PERCH.THE BIRDS SET UP A CLAMOUR WHEN THE GIRL APPEARED BUT SHE WENT FROM ONETO ANOTHER CARESSING SOME TAKING OTHERS FOR AN INSTANT UPON HER WRISTOR STOOPING TO ADJUST THEIR JESSES.ARE THEY NOT PRETTY SHE SAID. SEE HERE IS A FALCONGENTIL. WE CALLIT IGNOBLE BECAUSE IT TAKES THE QUARRY IN DIRECT CHASE. THIS IS A BLUEFALCON. IN FALCONRY WE CALL IT NOBLE BECAUSE IT RISES OVER THE QUARRYAND WHEELING DROPS UPON IT FROM ABOVE. THIS WHITE BIRD IS A GERFALCONFROM THE NORTH. IT IS ALSO NOBLE HERE IS A MERLIN AND THIS TIERCELETIS A FALCONHERONER.I ASKED HER HOW SHE HAD LEARNED THE OLD LANGUAGE OF FALCONRY. SHE DID NOTREMEMBER BUT THOUGHT HER FATHER MUST HAVE TAUGHT IT TO HER WHEN SHE WASVERY YOUNG.THEN SHE LED ME AWAY AND SHOWED ME THE YOUNG FALCONS STILL IN THE NEST.THEY ARE TERMED NIAIS IN FALCONRY SHE EXPLAINED. ABRANCHIER IS THE YOUNG BIRD WHICH IS JUST ABLE TO LEAVE THE NESTAND HOP FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH. A YOUNG BIRD WHICH HAS NOT YET MOULTED ISCALLED A SORS AND A MU IS A HAWK WHICH HAS MOULTED INCAPTIVITY. WHEN WE CATCH A WILD FALCON WHICH HAS CHANGED ITS PLUMAGE WETERM IT A HAGARD. RAOUL FIRST TAUGHT ME TO DRESS A FALCON. SHALL ITEACH YOU HOW IT IS DONESHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE BANK OF THE STREAM AMONG THE FALCONS AND ITHREW MYSELF AT HER FEET TO LISTEN.THEN THE DEMOISELLE DYS HELD UP ONE ROSYTIPPED FINGER AND BEGAN VERYGRAVELY.FIRST ONE MUST CATCH THE FALCON.I AM CAUGHT I ANSWERED.SHE LAUGHED VERY PRETTILY AND TOLD ME MY DRESSAGE WOULD PERHAPS BEDIFFICULT AS I WAS NOBLE.I AM ALREADY TAMED I REPLIED JESSED AND BELLED.SHE LAUGHED DELIGHTED. OH MY BRAVE FALCON THEN YOU WILL RETURN AT MYCALLI AM YOURS I ANSWERED GRAVELY.SHE SAT SILENT FOR A MOMENT. THEN THE COLOUR HEIGHTENED IN HER CHEEKS ANDSHE HELD UP HER FINGER AGAIN SAYING LISTEN I WISH TO SPEAK OFFALCONRYI LISTEN COUNTESS JEANNE DYS.BUT AGAIN SHE FELL INTO THE REVERIE AND HER EYES SEEMED FIXED ONSOMETHING BEYOND THE SUMMER CLOUDS.PHILIP SHE SAID AT LAST.JEANNE I WHISPERED.THAT IS ALLTHAT IS WHAT I WISHED SHE SIGHEDPHILIP AND JEANNE.SHE HELD HER HAND TOWARD ME AND I TOUCHED IT WITH MY LIPS.WIN ME SHE SAID BUT THIS TIME IT WAS THE BODY AND SOUL WHICH SPOKE INUNISON.AFTER A WHILE SHE BEGAN AGAIN LET US SPEAK OF FALCONRY.BEGIN I REPLIED WE HAVE CAUGHT THE FALCON.THEN JEANNE DYS TOOK MY HAND IN BOTH OF HERS AND TOLD ME HOW WITHINFINITE PATIENCE THE YOUNG FALCON WAS TAUGHT TO PERCH UPON THE WRISTHOW LITTLE BY LITTLE IT BECAME USED TO THE BELLED JESSES AND THECHAPERON  CORNETTE.THEY MUST FIRST HAVE A GOOD APPETITE SHE SAID THEN LITTLE BY LITTLEI REDUCE THEIR NOURISHMENT WHICH IN FALCONRY WE CALL PT. WHENAFTER MANY NIGHTS PASSED AU BLOC AS THESE BIRDS ARE NOW I PREVAILUPON THE HAGARD TO STAY QUIETLY ON THE WRIST THEN THE BIRD ISREADY TO BE TAUGHT TO COME FOR ITS FOOD. I FIX THE PT TO THE ENDOF A THONG OR LEURRE AND TEACH THE BIRD TO COME TO ME AS SOON ASI BEGIN TO WHIRL THE CORD IN CIRCLES ABOUT MY HEAD. AT FIRST I DROP THEPT WHEN THE FALCON COMES AND HE EATS THE FOOD ON THE GROUND.AFTER A LITTLE HE WILL LEARN TO SEIZE THE LEURRE IN MOTION AS IWHIRL IT AROUND MY HEAD OR DRAG IT OVER THE GROUND. AFTER THIS IT IS EASYTO TEACH THE FALCON TO STRIKE AT GAME ALWAYS REMEMBERING TO FAIRECOURTOISIE  LOISEAU THAT IS TO ALLOW THE BIRD TO TASTE THEQUARRY.A SQUEAL FROM ONE OF THE FALCONS INTERRUPTED HER AND SHE AROSE TO ADJUSTTHE LONGE WHICH HAD BECOME WHIPPED ABOUT THE BLOC BUT THEBIRD STILL FLAPPED ITS WINGS AND SCREAMED.WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE SAID. PHILIP CAN YOU SEEI LOOKED AROUND AND AT FIRST SAW NOTHING TO CAUSE THE COMMOTION WHICHWAS NOW HEIGHTENED BY THE SCREAMS AND FLAPPING OF ALL THE BIRDS. THEN MYEYE FELL UPON THE FLAT ROCK BESIDE THE STREAM FROM WHICH THE GIRL HADRISEN. A GREY SERPENT WAS MOVING SLOWLY ACROSS THE SURFACE OF THEBOULDER AND THE EYES IN ITS FLAT TRIANGULAR HEAD SPARKLED LIKE JET.A COULEUVRE SHE SAID QUIETLY.IT IS HARMLESS IS IT NOT I ASKED.SHE POINTED TO THE BLACK VSHAPED FIGURE ON THE NECK.IT IS CERTAIN DEATH SHE SAID IT IS A VIPER.WE WATCHED THE REPTILE MOVING SLOWLY OVER THE SMOOTH ROCK TO WHERE THESUNLIGHT FELL IN A BROAD WARM PATCH.I STARTED FORWARD TO EXAMINE IT BUT SHE CLUNG TO MY ARM CRYING DONTPHILIP I AM AFRAID.FOR MEFOR YOU PHILIPI LOVE YOU.THEN I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AND KISSED HER ON THE LIPS BUT ALL I COULDSAY WAS JEANNE JEANNE JEANNE. AND AS SHE LAY TREMBLING ON MY BREASTSOMETHING STRUCK MY FOOT IN THE GRASS BELOW BUT I DID NOT HEED IT. THENAGAIN SOMETHING STRUCK MY ANKLE AND A SHARP PAIN SHOT THROUGH ME. ILOOKED INTO THE SWEET FACE OF JEANNE DYS AND KISSED HER AND WITH ALL MYSTRENGTH LIFTED HER IN MY ARMS AND FLUNG HER FROM ME. THEN BENDING ITORE THE VIPER FROM MY ANKLE AND SET MY HEEL UPON ITS HEAD. I REMEMBERFEELING WEAK AND NUMBI REMEMBER FALLING TO THE GROUND. THROUGH MYSLOWLY GLAZING EYES I SAW JEANNES WHITE FACE BENDING CLOSE TO MINE ANDWHEN THE LIGHT IN MY EYES WENT OUT I STILL FELT HER ARMS ABOUT MY NECKAND HER SOFT CHEEK AGAINST MY DRAWN LIPS.WHEN I OPENED MY EYES I LOOKED AROUND IN TERROR. JEANNE WAS GONE. I SAWTHE STREAM AND THE FLAT ROCK I SAW THE CRUSHED VIPER IN THE GRASS BESIDEME BUT THE HAWKS AND BLOCS HAD DISAPPEARED. I SPRANG TO MY FEET.THE GARDEN THE FRUIT TREES THE DRAWBRIDGE AND THE WALLED COURT WEREGONE. I STARED STUPIDLY AT A HEAP OF CRUMBLING RUINS IVYCOVERED ANDGREY THROUGH WHICH GREAT TREES HAD PUSHED THEIR WAY. I CREPT FORWARDDRAGGING MY NUMBED FOOT AND AS I MOVED A FALCON SAILED FROM THETREETOPS AMONG THE RUINS AND SOARING MOUNTING IN NARROWING CIRCLESFADED AND VANISHED IN THE CLOUDS ABOVE.JEANNE JEANNE I CRIED BUT MY VOICE DIED ON MY LIPS AND I FELL ON MYKNEES AMONG THE WEEDS. AND AS GOD WILLED IT I NOT KNOWING HAD FALLENKNEELING BEFORE A CRUMBLING SHRINE CARVED IN STONE FOR OUR MOTHER OFSORROWS. I SAW THE SAD FACE OF THE VIRGIN WROUGHT IN THE COLD STONE. ISAW THE CROSS AND THORNS AT HER FEET AND BENEATH IT I READ  PRAY FOR THE SOUL OF THE  DEMOISELLE JEANNE DYS  WHO DIED  IN HER YOUTH FOR LOVE OF  PHILIP A STRANGER.

THE EVENTS OF THEEVENING HAD SHAKEN HIM TERRIBLY BUT HE WOULD WALK IT OFF FORGET BURYEVERYTHING AND THEN GO BACK TO SYLVIA. HE STARTED ON SWIFTLY AND FOR ATIME THE BITTER THOUGHTS SEEMED TO FADE BUT WHEN HE PAUSED AT LASTBREATHLESS UNDER THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE THE BITTERNESS AND THE WRETCHEDNESSOF THE WHOLE THINGYES OF HIS WHOLE MISSPENT LIFE CAME BACK WITH A PANG.THEN THE FACE OF THE PRISONER STAMPED WITH THE HORRIBLE GRIMACE OF FEARGREW IN THE SHADOWS BEFORE HIS EYES.SICK AT HEART HE WANDERED UP AND DOWN UNDER THE GREAT ARC STRIVING TOOCCUPY HIS MIND PEERING UP AT THE SCULPTURED CORNICES TO READ THE NAMESOF THE HEROES AND BATTLES WHICH HE KNEW WERE ENGRAVED THERE BUT ALWAYSTHE ASHEN FACE OF HARTMAN FOLLOWED HIM GRINNING WITH TERROROR WAS ITTERRORWAS IT NOT TRIUMPHAT THE THOUGHT HE LEAPED LIKE A MAN WHOFEELS A KNIFE AT HIS THROAT BUT AFTER A SAVAGE TRAMP AROUND THE SQUARECAME BACK AGAIN AND SAT DOWN TO BATTLE WITH HIS MISERY.THE AIR WAS COLD BUT HIS CHEEKS WERE BURNING WITH ANGRY SHAME. SHAMEWHY WAS IT BECAUSE HE HAD MARRIED A GIRL WHOM CHANCE HAD MADE A MOTHERDID HE LOVE HER WAS THIS MISERABLE BOHEMIAN EXISTENCE THEN HIS ENDAND AIM IN LIFE HE TURNED HIS EYES UPON THE SECRETS OF HIS HEART ANDREAD AN EVIL STORYTHE STORY OF THE PAST AND HE COVERED HIS FACE FORSHAME WHILE KEEPING TIME TO THE DULL PAIN THROBBING IN HIS HEAD HISHEART BEAT OUT THE STORY FOR THE FUTURE. SHAME AND DISGRACE.ROUSED AT LAST FROM A LETHARGY WHICH HAD BEGUN TO NUMB THE BITTERNESS OFHIS THOUGHTS HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED ABOUT. A SUDDEN FOG HADSETTLED IN THE STREETS THE ARCHES OF THE ARC WERE CHOKED WITH IT. HEWOULD GO HOME. A GREAT HORROR OF BEING ALONE SEIZED HIM. BUT HE WAS NOTALONE. THE FOG WAS PEOPLED WITH PHANTOMS. ALL AROUND HIM IN THE MIST THEYMOVED DRIFTING THROUGH THE ARCHES IN LENGTHENING LINES AND VANISHEDWHILE FROM THE FOG OTHERS ROSE UP SWEPT PAST AND WERE ENGULFED. HE WASNOT ALONE FOR EVEN AT HIS SIDE THEY CROWDED TOUCHED HIM SWARMED BEFOREHIM BESIDE HIM BEHIND HIM PRESSED HIM BACK SEIZED AND BORE HIM WITHTHEM THROUGH THE MIST. DOWN A DIM AVENUE THROUGH LANES AND ALLEYS WHITEWITH FOG THEY MOVED AND IF THEY SPOKE THEIR VOICES WERE DULL AS THEVAPOUR WHICH SHROUDED THEM. AT LAST IN FRONT A BANK OF MASONRY AND EARTHCUT BY A MASSIVE IRON BARRED GATE TOWERED UP IN THE FOG. SLOWLY AND MORESLOWLY THEY GLIDED SHOULDER TO SHOULDER AND THIGH TO THIGH. THEN ALLMOVEMENT CEASED. A SUDDEN BREEZE STIRRED THE FOG. IT WAVERED AND EDDIED.OBJECTS BECAME MORE DISTINCT. A PALLOR CREPT ABOVE THE HORIZON TOUCHINGTHE EDGES OF THE WATERY CLOUDS AND DREW DULL SPARKS FROM A THOUSANDBAYONETS. BAYONETSTHEY WERE EVERYWHERE CLEAVING THE FOG OR FLOWINGBENEATH IT IN RIVERS OF STEEL. HIGH ON THE WALL OF MASONRY AND EARTH AGREAT GUN LOOMED AND AROUND IT FIGURES MOVED IN SILHOUETTES. BELOW ABROAD TORRENT OF BAYONETS SWEPT THROUGH THE IRON BARRED GATEWAY OUT INTOTHE SHADOWY PLAIN. IT BECAME LIGHTER. FACES GREW MORE DISTINCT AMONG THEMARCHING MASSES AND HE RECOGNIZED ONE.YOU PHILIPPETHE FIGURE TURNED ITS HEAD.TRENT CRIED IS THERE ROOM FOR ME BUT THE OTHER ONLY WAVED HIS ARM IN AVAGUE ADIEU AND WAS GONE WITH THE REST. PRESENTLY THE CAVALRY BEGAN TOPASS SQUADRON ON SQUADRON CROWDING OUT INTO THE DARKNESS THEN MANYCANNON THEN AN AMBULANCE THEN AGAIN THE ENDLESS LINES OF BAYONETS.BESIDE HIM A CUIRASSIER SAT ON HIS STEAMING HORSE AND IN FRONT AMONG AGROUP OF MOUNTED OFFICERS HE SAW A GENERAL WITH THE ASTRAKAN COLLAR OFHIS DOLMAN TURNED UP ABOUT HIS BLOODLESS FACE.SOME WOMEN WERE WEEPING NEAR HIM AND ONE WAS STRUGGLING TO FORCE A LOAF OFBLACK BREAD INTO A SOLDIERS HAVERSACK. THE SOLDIER TRIED TO AID HER BUTTHE SACK WAS FASTENED AND HIS RIFLE BOTHERED HIM SO TRENT HELD IT WHILETHE WOMAN UNBUTTONED THE SACK AND FORCED IN THE BREAD NOW ALL WET WITHHER TEARS. THE RIFLE WAS NOT HEAVY. TRENT FOUND IT WONDERFULLY MANAGEABLE.WAS THE BAYONET SHARP HE TRIED IT. THEN A SUDDEN LONGING A FIERCEIMPERATIVE DESIRE TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM.CHOUETTE CRIED A GAMIN CLINGING TO THE BARRED GATE ENCORE TOI MONVIEUXTRENT LOOKED UP AND THE RATKILLER LAUGHED IN HIS FACE. BUT WHEN THESOLDIER HAD TAKEN THE RIFLE AGAIN AND THANKING HIM RAN HARD TO CATCH HISBATTALION HE PLUNGED INTO THE THRONG ABOUT THE GATEWAY.ARE YOU GOING HE CRIED TO A MARINE WHO SAT IN THE GUTTER BANDAGING HISFOOT.YES.THEN A GIRLA MERE CHILDCAUGHT HIM BY THE HAND AND LED HIM INTO THECAF WHICH FACED THE GATE. THE ROOM WAS CROWDED WITH SOLDIERS SOME WHITEAND SILENT SITTING ON THE FLOOR OTHERS GROANING ON THE LEATHERCOVEREDSETTEES. THE AIR WAS SOUR AND SUFFOCATING.CHOOSE SAID THE GIRL WITH A LITTLE GESTURE OF PITY THEY CANT GOIN A HEAP OF CLOTHING ON THE FLOOR HE FOUND A CAPOTE AND KPI.SHE HELPED HIM BUCKLE HIS KNAPSACK CARTRIDGEBOX AND BELT AND SHOWEDHIM HOW TO LOAD THE CHASSEPOT RIFLE HOLDING IT ON HER KNEES.WHEN HE THANKED HER SHE STARTED TO HER FEET.YOU ARE A FOREIGNERAMERICAN HE SAID MOVING TOWARD THE DOOR BUT THE CHILD BARRED HIS WAY.I AM A BRETONNE. MY FATHER IS UP THERE WITH THE CANNON OF THE MARINE. HEWILL SHOOT YOU IF YOU ARE A SPY.THEY FACED EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT. THEN SIGHING HE BENT OVER AND KISSEDTHE CHILD. PRAY FOR FRANCE LITTLE ONE HE MURMURED AND SHE REPEATEDWITH A PALE SMILE FOR FRANCE AND YOU BEAU MONSIEUR.HE RAN ACROSS THE STREET AND THROUGH THE GATEWAY. ONCE OUTSIDE HE EDGEDINTO LINE AND SHOULDERED HIS WAY ALONG THE ROAD. A CORPORAL PASSED LOOKEDAT HIM REPASSED AND FINALLY CALLED AN OFFICER. YOU BELONG TO THE THGROWLED THE CORPORAL LOOKING AT THE NUMBER ON HIS KPI.WE HAVE NO USE FOR FRANCTIREURS ADDED THE OFFICER CATCHING SIGHT OFHIS BLACK TROUSERS.I WISH TO VOLUNTEER IN PLACE OF A COMRADE SAID TRENT AND THE OFFICERSHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND PASSED ON.NOBODY PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO HIM ONE OR TWO MERELY GLANCING AT HISTROUSERS. THE ROAD WAS DEEP WITH SLUSH AND MUDPLOUGHED AND TORN BY WHEELSAND HOOFS. A SOLDIER IN FRONT OF HIM WRENCHED HIS FOOT IN AN ICY RUT ANDDRAGGED HIMSELF TO THE EDGE OF THE EMBANKMENT GROANING. THE PLAIN ONEITHER SIDE OF THEM WAS GREY WITH MELTING SNOW. HERE AND THERE BEHINDDISMANTLED HEDGEROWS STOOD WAGONS BEARING WHITE FLAGS WITH RED CROSSES.SOMETIMES THE DRIVER WAS A PRIEST IN RUSTY HAT AND GOWN SOMETIMES ACRIPPLED MOBILE. ONCE THEY PASSED A WAGON DRIVEN BY A SISTER OF CHARITY.SILENT EMPTY HOUSES WITH GREAT RENTS IN THEIR WALLS AND EVERY WINDOWBLANK HUDDLED ALONG THE ROAD. FURTHER ON WITHIN THE ZONE OF DANGERNOTHING OF HUMAN HABITATION REMAINED EXCEPT HERE AND THERE A PILE OFFROZEN BRICKS OR A BLACKENED CELLAR CHOKED WITH SNOW.FOR SOME TIME TRENT HAD BEEN ANNOYED BY THE MAN BEHIND HIM WHO KEPTTREADING ON HIS HEELS. CONVINCED AT LAST THAT IT WAS INTENTIONAL HETURNED TO REMONSTRATE AND FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH A FELLOWSTUDENTFROM THE BEAUX ARTS. TRENT STARED.I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITALTHE OTHER SHOOK HIS HEAD POINTING TO HIS BANDAGED JAW.I SEE YOU CANT SPEAK. CAN I DO ANYTHINGTHE WOUNDED MAN RUMMAGED IN HIS HAVERSACK AND PRODUCED A CRUST OF BLACKBREAD.HE CANT EAT IT HIS JAW IS SMASHED AND HE WANTS YOU TO CHEW IT FORHIM SAID THE SOLDIER NEXT TO HIM.TRENT TOOK THE CRUST AND GRINDING IT IN HIS TEETH MORSEL BY MORSELPASSED IT BACK TO THE STARVING MAN.FROM TIME TO TIME MOUNTED ORDERLIES SPED TO THE FRONT COVERING THEM WITHSLUSH. IT WAS A CHILLY SILENT MARCH THROUGH SODDEN MEADOWS WREATHED INFOG. ALONG THE RAILROAD EMBANKMENT ACROSS THE DITCH ANOTHER COLUMN MOVEDPARALLEL TO THEIR OWN. TRENT WATCHED IT A SOMBRE MASS NOW DISTINCT NOWVAGUE NOW BLOTTED OUT IN A PUFF OF FOG. ONCE FOR HALFANHOUR HE LOST ITBUT WHEN AGAIN IT CAME INTO VIEW HE NOTICED A THIN LINE DETACH ITSELFFROM THE FLANK AND BELLYING IN THE MIDDLE SWING RAPIDLY TO THE WEST. ATTHE SAME MOMENT A PROLONGED CRACKLING BROKE OUT IN THE FOG IN FRONT. OTHERLINES BEGAN TO SLOUGH OFF FROM THE COLUMN SWINGING EAST AND WEST AND THECRACKLING BECAME CONTINUOUS. A BATTERY PASSED AT FULL GALLOP AND HE DREWBACK WITH HIS COMRADES TO GIVE IT WAY. IT WENT INTO ACTION A LITTLE TO THERIGHT OF HIS BATTALION AND AS THE SHOT FROM THE FIRST RIFLED PIECE BOOMEDTHROUGH THE MIST THE CANNON FROM THE FORTIFICATIONS OPENED WITH A MIGHTYROAR. AN OFFICER GALLOPED BY SHOUTING SOMETHING WHICH TRENT DID NOT CATCHBUT HE SAW THE RANKS IN FRONT SUDDENLY PART COMPANY WITH HIS OWN ANDDISAPPEAR IN THE TWILIGHT. MORE OFFICERS RODE UP AND STOOD BESIDE HIMPEERING INTO THE FOG. AWAY IN FRONT THE CRACKLING HAD BECOME ONE PROLONGEDCRASH. IT WAS DREARY WAITING. TRENT CHEWED SOME BREAD FOR THE MAN BEHINDWHO TRIED TO SWALLOW IT AND AFTER A WHILE SHOOK HIS HEAD MOTIONING TRENTTO EAT THE REST HIMSELF. A CORPORAL OFFERED HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND HEDRANK IT BUT WHEN HE TURNED AROUND TO RETURN THE FLASK THE CORPORAL WASLYING ON THE GROUND. ALARMED HE LOOKED AT THE SOLDIER NEXT TO HIM WHOSHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK BUT SOMETHING STRUCKHIM AND HE ROLLED OVER AND OVER INTO THE DITCH BELOW. AT THAT MOMENT THEHORSE OF ONE OF THE OFFICERS GAVE A BOUND AND BACKED INTO THE BATTALIONLASHING OUT WITH HIS HEELS. ONE MAN WAS RIDDEN DOWN ANOTHER WAS KICKED INTHE CHEST AND HURLED THROUGH THE RANKS. THE OFFICER SANK HIS SPURS INTOTHE HORSE AND FORCED HIM TO THE FRONT AGAIN WHERE HE STOOD TREMBLING. THECANNONADE SEEMED TO DRAW NEARER. A STAFFOFFICER RIDING SLOWLY UP ANDDOWN THE BATTALION SUDDENLY COLLAPSED IN HIS SADDLE AND CLUNG TO HISHORSES MANE. ONE OF HIS BOOTS DANGLED CRIMSONED AND DRIPPING FROM THESTIRRUP. THEN OUT OF THE MIST IN FRONT MEN CAME RUNNING. THE ROADS THEFIELDS THE DITCHES WERE FULL OF THEM AND MANY OF THEM FELL. FOR ANINSTANT HE IMAGINED HE SAW HORSEMEN RIDING ABOUT LIKE GHOSTS IN THEVAPOURS BEYOND AND A MAN BEHIND HIM CURSED HORRIBLY DECLARING HE TOO HADSEEN THEM AND THAT THEY WERE UHLANS BUT THE BATTALION STOOD INACTIVEAND THE MIST FELL AGAIN OVER THE MEADOWS.THE COLONEL SAT HEAVILY UPON HIS HORSE HIS BULLETSHAPED HEAD BURIED INTHE ASTRAKAN COLLAR OF HIS DOLMAN HIS FAT LEGS STICKING STRAIGHT OUT INTHE STIRRUPS.THE BUGLERS CLUSTERED ABOUT HIM WITH BUGLES POISED AND BEHIND HIM ASTAFFOFFICER IN A PALE BLUE JACKET SMOKED A CIGARETTE AND CHATTED WITH ACAPTAIN OF HUSSARS. FROM THE ROAD IN FRONT CAME THE SOUND OF FURIOUSGALLOPING AND AN ORDERLY REINED UP BESIDE THE COLONEL WHO MOTIONED HIM TOTHE REAR WITHOUT TURNING HIS HEAD. THEN ON THE LEFT A CONFUSED MURMURAROSE WHICH ENDED IN A SHOUT. A HUSSAR PASSED LIKE THE WIND FOLLOWED BYANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND THEN SQUADRON AFTER SQUADRON WHIRLED BY THEM INTOTHE SHEETED MISTS. AT THAT INSTANT THE COLONEL REARED IN HIS SADDLE THEBUGLES CLANGED AND THE WHOLE BATTALION SCRAMBLED DOWN THE EMBANKMENTOVER THE DITCH AND STARTED ACROSS THE SOGGY MEADOW. ALMOST AT ONCE TRENTLOST HIS CAP. SOMETHING SNATCHED IT FROM HIS HEAD HE THOUGHT IT WAS ATREE BRANCH. A GOOD MANY OF HIS COMRADES ROLLED OVER IN THE SLUSH AND ICEAND HE IMAGINED THAT THEY HAD SLIPPED. ONE PITCHED RIGHT ACROSS HIS PATHAND HE STOPPED TO HELP HIM UP BUT THE MAN SCREAMED WHEN HE TOUCHED HIMAND AN OFFICER SHOUTED FORWARD FORWARD SO HE RAN ON AGAIN. IT WAS ALONG JOG THROUGH THE MIST AND HE WAS OFTEN OBLIGED TO SHIFT HIS RIFLE.WHEN AT LAST THEY LAY PANTING BEHIND THE RAILROAD EMBANKMENT HE LOOKEDABOUT HIM. HE HAD FELT THE NEED OF ACTION OF A DESPERATE PHYSICALSTRUGGLE OF KILLING AND CRUSHING. HE HAD BEEN SEIZED WITH A DESIRE TOFLING HIMSELF AMONG MASSES AND TEAR RIGHT AND LEFT. HE LONGED TO FIRE TOUSE THE THIN SHARP BAYONET ON HIS CHASSEPOT. HE HAD NOT EXPECTED THIS. HEWISHED TO BECOME EXHAUSTED TO STRUGGLE AND CUT UNTIL INCAPABLE OF LIFTINGHIS ARM. THEN HE HAD INTENDED TO GO HOME. HE HEARD A MAN SAY THAT HALF THEBATTALION HAD GONE DOWN IN THE CHARGE AND HE SAW ANOTHER EXAMINING ACORPSE UNDER THE EMBANKMENT. THE BODY STILL WARM WAS CLOTHED IN ASTRANGE UNIFORM BUT EVEN WHEN HE NOTICED THE SPIKED HELMET LYING A FEWINCHES FURTHER AWAY HE DID NOT REALIZE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.THE COLONEL SAT ON HIS HORSE A FEW FEET TO THE LEFT HIS EYES SPARKLINGUNDER THE CRIMSON KPI. TRENT HEARD HIM REPLY TO AN OFFICER I CAN HOLDIT BUT ANOTHER CHARGE AND I WONT HAVE ENOUGH MEN LEFT TO SOUND ABUGLE.WERE THE PRUSSIANS HERE TRENT ASKED OF A SOLDIER WHO SAT WIPING THEBLOOD TRICKLING FROM HIS HAIR.YES. THE HUSSARS CLEANED THEM OUT. WE CAUGHT THEIR CROSS FIRE.WE ARE SUPPORTING A BATTERY ON THE EMBANKMENT SAID ANOTHER.THEN THE BATTALION CRAWLED OVER THE EMBANKMENT AND MOVED ALONG THE LINESOF TWISTED RAILS. TRENT ROLLED UP HIS TROUSERS AND TUCKED THEM INTO HISWOOLLEN SOCKS BUT THEY HALTED AGAIN AND SOME OF THE MEN SAT DOWN ON THEDISMANTLED RAILROAD TRACK. TRENT LOOKED FOR HIS WOUNDED COMRADE FROM THEBEAUX ARTS. HE WAS STANDING IN HIS PLACE VERY PALE. THE CANNONADE HADBECOME TERRIFIC. FOR A MOMENT THE MIST LIFTED. HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THEFIRST BATTALION MOTIONLESS ON THE RAILROAD TRACK IN FRONT OF REGIMENTS ONEITHER FLANK AND THEN AS THE FOG SETTLED AGAIN THE DRUMS BEAT AND THEMUSIC OF THE BUGLES BEGAN AWAY ON THE EXTREME LEFT. A RESTLESS MOVEMENTPASSED AMONG THE TROOPS THE COLONEL THREW UP HIS ARM THE DRUMS ROLLEDAND THE BATTALION MOVED OFF THROUGH THE FOG. THEY WERE NEAR THE FRONT NOWFOR THE BATTALION WAS FIRING AS IT ADVANCED. AMBULANCES GALLOPED ALONG THEBASE OF THE EMBANKMENT TO THE REAR AND THE HUSSARS PASSED AND REPASSEDLIKE PHANTOMS. THEY WERE IN THE FRONT AT LAST FOR ALL ABOUT THEM WASMOVEMENT AND TURMOIL WHILE FROM THE FOG CLOSE AT HAND CAME CRIES ANDGROANS AND CRASHING VOLLEYS. SHELLS FELL EVERYWHERE BURSTING ALONG THEEMBANKMENT SPLASHING THEM WITH FROZEN SLUSH. TRENT WAS FRIGHTENED. HEBEGAN TO DREAD THE UNKNOWN WHICH LAY THERE CRACKLING AND FLAMING INOBSCURITY. THE SHOCK OF THE CANNON SICKENED HIM. HE COULD EVEN SEE THE FOGLIGHT UP WITH A DULL ORANGE AS THE THUNDER SHOOK THE EARTH. IT WAS NEARHE FELT CERTAIN FOR THE COLONEL SHOUTED FORWARD AND THE FIRSTBATTALION WAS HASTENING INTO IT. HE FELT ITS BREATH HE TREMBLED BUTHURRIED ON. A FEARFUL DISCHARGE IN FRONT TERRIFIED HIM. SOMEWHERE IN THEFOG MEN WERE CHEERING AND THE COLONELS HORSE STREAMING WITH BLOODPLUNGED ABOUT IN THE SMOKE.ANOTHER BLAST AND SHOCK RIGHT IN HIS FACE ALMOST STUNNED HIM AND HEFALTERED. ALL THE MEN TO THE RIGHT WERE DOWN. HIS HEAD SWAM THE FOG ANDSMOKE STUPEFIED HIM. HE PUT OUT HIS HAND FOR A SUPPORT AND CAUGHTSOMETHING. IT WAS THE WHEEL OF A GUNCARRIAGE AND A MAN SPRANG FROMBEHIND IT AIMING A BLOW AT HIS HEAD WITH A RAMMER BUT STUMBLED BACKSHRIEKING WITH A BAYONET THROUGH HIS NECK AND TRENT KNEW THAT HE HADKILLED. MECHANICALLY HE STOOPED TO PICK UP HIS RIFLE BUT THE BAYONET WASSTILL IN THE MAN WHO LAY BEATING WITH RED HANDS AGAINST THE SOD. ITSICKENED HIM AND HE LEANED ON THE CANNON. MEN WERE FIGHTING ALL AROUND HIMNOW AND THE AIR WAS FOUL WITH SMOKE AND SWEAT. SOMEBODY SEIZED HIM FROMBEHIND AND ANOTHER IN FRONT BUT OTHERS IN TURN SEIZED THEM OR STRUCK THEMSOLID BLOWS. THE CLICK CLICK CLICK OF BAYONETS INFURIATED HIM AND HEGRASPED THE RAMMER AND STRUCK OUT BLINDLY UNTIL IT WAS SHIVERED TO PIECES.A MAN THREW HIS ARM AROUND HIS NECK AND BORE HIM TO THE GROUND BUT HETHROTTLED HIM AND RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES. HE SAW A COMRADE SEIZE THECANNON AND FALL ACROSS IT WITH HIS SKULL CRUSHED IN HE SAW THE COLONELTUMBLE CLEAN OUT OF HIS SADDLE INTO THE MUD THEN CONSCIOUSNESS FLED.WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF HE WAS LYING ON THE EMBANKMENT AMONG THE TWISTEDRAILS. ON EVERY SIDE HUDDLED MEN WHO CRIED OUT AND CURSED AND FLED AWAYINTO THE FOG AND HE STAGGERED TO HIS FEET AND FOLLOWED THEM. ONCE HESTOPPED TO HELP A COMRADE WITH A BANDAGED JAW WHO COULD NOT SPEAK BUTCLUNG TO HIS ARM FOR A TIME AND THEN FELL DEAD IN THE FREEZING MIRE ANDAGAIN HE AIDED ANOTHER WHO GROANED TRENT CEST MOIPHILIPPE UNTIL ASUDDEN VOLLEY IN THE MIDST RELIEVED HIM OF HIS CHARGE.AN ICY WIND SWEPT DOWN FROM THE HEIGHTS CUTTING THE FOG INTO SHREDS. FORAN INSTANT WITH AN EVIL LEER THE SUN PEERED THROUGH THE NAKED WOODS OFVINCENNES SANK LIKE A BLOODCLOT IN THE BATTERY SMOKE LOWER LOWER INTOTHE BLOODSOAKED PLAIN.IVWHEN MIDNIGHT SOUNDED FROM THE BELFRY OF ST. SULPICE THE GATES OF PARISWERE STILL CHOKED WITH FRAGMENTS OF WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN AN ARMY.THEY ENTERED WITH THE NIGHT A SULLEN HORDE SPATTERED WITH SLIME FAINTWITH HUNGER AND EXHAUSTION. THERE WAS LITTLE DISORDER AT FIRST AND THETHRONG AT THE GATES PARTED SILENTLY AS THE TROOPS TRAMPED ALONG THEFREEZING STREETS. CONFUSION CAME AS THE HOURS PASSED. SWIFTLY AND MORESWIFTLY CROWDING SQUADRON AFTER SQUADRON AND BATTERY ON BATTERY HORSESPLUNGING AND CAISSONS JOLTING THE REMNANTS FROM THE FRONT SURGED THROUGHTHE GATES A CHAOS OF CAVALRY AND ARTILLERY STRUGGLING FOR THE RIGHT OFWAY. CLOSE UPON THEM STUMBLED THE INFANTRY HERE A SKELETON OF A REGIMENTMARCHING WITH A DESPERATE ATTEMPT AT ORDER THERE A RIOTOUS MOB OF MOBILESCRUSHING THEIR WAY TO THE STREETS THEN A TURMOIL OF HORSEMEN CANNONTROOPS WITHOUT OFFICERS OFFICERS WITHOUT MEN THEN AGAIN A LINE OFAMBULANCES THE WHEELS GROANING UNDER THEIR HEAVY LOADS.DUMB WITH MISERY THE CROWD LOOKED ON.ALL THROUGH THE DAY THE AMBULANCES HAD BEEN ARRIVING AND ALL DAY LONG THERAGGED THRONG WHIMPERED AND SHIVERED BY THE BARRIERS. AT NOON THE CROWDWAS INCREASED TENFOLD FILLING THE SQUARES ABOUT THE GATES AND SWARMINGOVER THE INNER FORTIFICATIONS.AT FOUR OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THE GERMAN BATTERIES SUDDENLY WREATHEDTHEMSELVES IN SMOKE AND THE SHELLS FELL FAST ON MONTPARNASSE. AT TWENTYMINUTES AFTER FOUR TWO PROJECTILES STRUCK A HOUSE IN THE RUE DE BAC AND AMOMENT LATER THE FIRST SHELL FELL IN THE LATIN QUARTER.BRAITH WAS PAINTING IN BED WHEN WEST CAME IN VERY MUCH SCARED.I WISH YOU WOULD COME DOWN OUR HOUSE HAS BEEN KNOCKED INTO A COCKED HATAND IM AFRAID THAT SOME OF THE PILLAGERS MAY TAKE IT INTO THEIR HEADS TOPAY US A VISIT TONIGHT.BRAITH JUMPED OUT OF BED AND BUNDLED HIMSELF INTO A GARMENT WHICH HAD ONCEBEEN AN OVERCOAT.ANYBODY HURT HE INQUIRED STRUGGLING WITH A SLEEVE FULL OF DILAPIDATEDLINING.NO.

ASECOND STRUCK A CHIMNEY AND PLUNGED INTO THE GARDEN FOLLOWED BY ANAVALANCHE OF BRICKS AND ANOTHER EXPLODED WITH A DEAFENING REPORT IN THENEXT STREET.THEY HURRIED ALONG THE PASSAGE TO THE STEPS WHICH LED TO THE CELLAR.

THE IRON DOOR WAS BARRED.COLETTE COLETTE HE CALLED. THE DOOR SWUNG INWARD AND THE GIRL SPRANGUP THE STAIRS TO MEET THEM. AT THAT INSTANT BRAITH GLANCING BEHIND HIMGAVE A STARTLED CRY AND PUSHING THE TWO BEFORE HIM INTO THE CELLARJUMPED DOWN AFTER THEM AND SLAMMED THE IRON DOOR. A FEW SECONDS LATER AHEAVY JAR FROM THE OUTSIDE SHOOK THE HINGES.THEY ARE HERE MUTTERED WEST VERY PALE.THAT DOOR OBSERVED COLETTE CALMLY WILL HOLD FOR EVER.BRAITH EXAMINED THE LOW IRON STRUCTURE NOW TREMBLING WITH THE BLOWSRAINED ON IT FROM WITHOUT.

THAT MISERLY LANDLORD OF MINEA CRASH FROM THE OUTSIDE FOLLOWED BY A YELL CUT HIM SHORT THEN BLOWAFTER BLOW SHOOK THE DOORS UNTIL THERE CAME A SHARP SNAP A CLINKING OFMETAL AND A TRIANGULAR BIT OF IRON FELL INWARDS LEAVING A HOLE THROUGHWHICH STRUGGLED A RAY OF LIGHT.INSTANTLY WEST KNELT AND SHOVING HIS REVOLVER THROUGH THE APERTURE FIREDEVERY CARTRIDGE. FOR A MOMENT THE ALLEY RESOUNDED WITH THE RACKET OF THEREVOLVER THEN ABSOLUTE SILENCE FOLLOWED.PRESENTLY A SINGLE QUESTIONING BLOW FELL UPON THE DOOR AND A MOMENT LATERANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND THEN A SUDDEN CRACK ZIGZAGGED ACROSS THE IRONPLATE.HERE SAID WEST SEIZING COLETTE BY THE WRIST YOU FOLLOW ME BRAITHAND HE RAN SWIFTLY TOWARD A CIRCULAR SPOT OF LIGHT AT THE FURTHER END OFTHE CELLAR. THE SPOT OF LIGHT CAME FROM A BARRED MANHOLE ABOVE. WESTMOTIONED BRAITH TO MOUNT ON HIS SHOULDERS.PUSH IT OVER. YOU MUSTWITH LITTLE EFFORT BRAITH LIFTED THE BARRED COVER SCRAMBLED OUT ON HISSTOMACH AND EASILY RAISED COLETTE FROM WESTS SHOULDERS.QUICK OLD CHAP CRIED THE LATTER.BRAITH TWISTED HIS LEGS AROUND A FENCECHAIN AND LEANED DOWN AGAIN. THECELLAR WAS FLOODED WITH A YELLOW LIGHT AND THE AIR REEKED WITH THE STENCHOF PETROLEUM TORCHES.

JUMP AND WEST HUNG DANGLING UNTIL COLETTEGRASPED HIM BY THE COLLAR AND HE WAS DRAGGED OUT. THEN HER NERVES GAVEWAY AND SHE WEPT HYSTERICALLY BUT WEST THREW HIS ARM AROUND HER AND LEDHER ACROSS THE GARDENS INTO THE NEXT STREET WHERE BRAITH AFTER REPLACINGTHE MANHOLE COVER AND PILING SOME STONE SLABS FROM THE WALL OVER ITREJOINED THEM. IT WAS ALMOST DARK. THEY HURRIED THROUGH THE STREET NOWONLY LIGHTED BY BURNING BUILDINGS OR THE SWIFT GLARE OF THE SHELLS. THEYGAVE WIDE BERTH TO THE FIRES BUT AT A DISTANCE SAW THE FLITTING FORMS OFPILLAGERS AMONG THE DBRIS. SOMETIMES THEY PASSED A FEMALE FURY CRAZEDWITH DRINK SHRIEKING ANATHEMAS UPON THE WORLD OR SOME SLOUCHING LOUTWHOSE BLACKENED FACE AND HANDS BETRAYED HIS SHARE IN THE WORK OFDESTRUCTION. AT LAST THEY REACHED THE SEINE AND PASSED THE BRIDGE ANDTHEN BRAITH SAID I MUST GO BACK. I AM NOT SURE OF JACK AND SYLVIA. ASHE SPOKE HE MADE WAY FOR A CROWD WHICH CAME TRAMPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGEAND ALONG THE RIVER WALL BY THE DORSAY BARRACKS. IN THE MIDST OF IT WESTCAUGHT THE MEASURED TREAD OF A PLATOON. A LANTERN PASSED A FILE OFBAYONETS THEN ANOTHER LANTERN WHICH GLIMMERED ON A DEATHLY FACE BEHINDAND COLETTE GASPED HARTMAN AND HE WAS GONE. THEY PEERED FEARFULLYACROSS THE EMBANKMENT HOLDING THEIR BREATH. THERE WAS A SHUFFLE OF FEETON THE QUAY AND THE GATE OF THE BARRACKS SLAMMED. A LANTERN SHONE FOR AMOMENT AT THE POSTERN THE CROWD PRESSED TO THE GRILLE THEN CAME THECLANG OF THE VOLLEY FROM THE STONE PARADE.ONE BY ONE THE PETROLEUM TORCHES FLARED UP ALONG THE EMBANKMENT AND NOWTHE WHOLE SQUARE WAS IN MOTION.

BOULANGER AND LEFEBVRE PRESENTLY SUBSIDING INTO ASCUFFLE ON THE STAIRS OUTSIDE. SELBY APPREHENSIVE AS TO HIS OWN RECEPTIONIN THE STUDIO LOOKED AT CLIFFORD WHO SAT SERENELY WATCHING THE FIGHT.ITS A LITTLE NOISY HERE SAID CLIFFORD BUT YOU WILL LIKE THE FELLOWSWHEN YOU KNOW THEM. HIS UNAFFECTED MANNER DELIGHTED SELBY. THEN WITH ASIMPLICITY THAT WON HIS HEART HE PRESENTED HIM TO HALF A DOZEN STUDENTSOF AS MANY NATIONALITIES. SOME WERE CORDIAL ALL WERE POLITE. EVEN THEMAJESTIC CREATURE WHO HELD THE POSITION OF MASSIER UNBENT ENOUGH TO SAYMY FRIEND WHEN A MAN SPEAKS FRENCH AS WELL AS YOU DO AND IS ALSO AFRIEND OF MONSIEUR CLIFFORD HE WILL HAVE NO TROUBLE IN THIS STUDIO. YOUEXPECT OF COURSE TO FILL THE STOVE UNTIL THE NEXT NEW MAN COMESOF COURSE.AND YOU DONT MIND CHAFFNO REPLIED SELBY WHO HATED IT.CLIFFORD MUCH AMUSED PUT ON HIS HAT SAYING YOU MUST EXPECT LOTS OF ITAT FIRST.SELBY PLACED HIS OWN HAT ON HIS HEAD AND FOLLOWED HIM TO THE DOOR.AS THEY PASSED THE MODEL STAND THERE WAS A FURIOUS CRY OF CHAPEAUCHAPEAU AND A STUDENT SPRANG FROM HIS EASEL MENACING SELBY WHO REDDENEDBUT LOOKED AT CLIFFORD.TAKE OFF YOUR HAT FOR THEM SAID THE LATTER LAUGHING.A LITTLE EMBARRASSED HE TURNED AND SALUTED THE STUDIO.ET MOI CRIED THE MODEL.YOU ARE CHARMING REPLIED SELBY ASTONISHED AT HIS OWN AUDACITY BUT THESTUDIO ROSE AS ONE MAN SHOUTING HE HAS DONE WELL HES ALL RIGHTWHILE THE MODEL LAUGHING KISSED HER HAND TO HIM AND CRIED  DEMAINBEAU JEUNE HOMMEALL THAT WEEK SELBY WORKED AT THE STUDIO UNMOLESTED. THE FRENCH STUDENTSCHRISTENED HIM LENFANT PRODIGUE WHICH WAS FREELY TRANSLATED THEPRODIGIOUS INFANT THE KID KID SELBY AND KIDBY. BUT THE DISEASESOON RAN ITS COURSE FROM KIDBY TO KIDNEY AND THEN NATURALLY TOTIDBITS WHERE IT WAS ARRESTED BY CLIFFORDS AUTHORITY AND ULTIMATELYRELAPSED TO KID.WEDNESDAY CAME AND WITH IT M. BOULANGER. FOR THREE HOURS THE STUDENTSWRITHED UNDER HIS BITING SARCASMSAMONG THE OTHERS CLIFFORD WHO WASINFORMED THAT HE KNEW EVEN LESS ABOUT A WORK OF ART THAN HE DID ABOUT THEART OF WORK. SELBY WAS MORE FORTUNATE. THE PROFESSOR EXAMINED HIS DRAWINGIN SILENCE LOOKED AT HIM SHARPLY AND PASSED ON WITH A NONCOMMITTALGESTURE. HE PRESENTLY DEPARTED ARM IN ARM WITH BOUGUEREAU TO THE RELIEFOF CLIFFORD WHO WAS THEN AT LIBERTY TO JAM HIS HAT ON HIS HEAD ANDDEPART.THE NEXT DAY HE DID NOT APPEAR AND SELBY WHO HAD COUNTED ON SEEING HIMAT THE STUDIO A THING WHICH HE LEARNED LATER IT WAS VANITY TO COUNT ONWANDERED BACK TO THE LATIN QUARTER ALONE.PARIS WAS STILL STRANGE AND NEW TO HIM. HE WAS VAGUELY TROUBLED BY ITSSPLENDOUR. NO TENDER MEMORIES STIRRED HIS AMERICAN BOSOM AT THE PLACE DUCHTELET NOR EVEN BY NOTRE DAME. THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE WITH ITS CLOCK ANDTURRETS AND STALKING SENTINELS IN BLUE AND VERMILION THE PLACE ST. MICHELWITH ITS JUMBLE OF OMNIBUSES AND UGLY WATERSPITTING GRIFFINS THE HILL OFTHE BOULEVARD ST. MICHEL THE TOOTING TRAMS THE POLICEMEN DAWDLING TWO BYTWO AND THE TABLELINED TERRACES OF THE CAF VACEHETT WERE NOTHING TOHIM AS YET NOR DID HE EVEN KNOW WHEN HE STEPPED FROM THE STONES OF THEPLACE ST. MICHEL TO THE ASPHALT OF THE BOULEVARD THAT HE HAD CROSSED THEFRONTIER AND ENTERED THE STUDENT ZONETHE FAMOUS LATIN QUARTER.A CABMAN HAILED HIM AS BOURGEOIS AND URGED THE SUPERIORITY OF DRIVINGOVER WALKING. A GAMIN WITH AN APPEARANCE OF GREAT CONCERN REQUESTED THELATEST TELEGRAPHIC NEWS FROM LONDON AND THEN STANDING ON HIS HEADINVITED SELBY TO FEATS OF STRENGTH. A PRETTY GIRL GAVE HIM A GLANCE FROM APAIR OF VIOLET EYES. HE DID NOT SEE HER BUT SHE CATCHING HER OWNREFLECTION IN A WINDOW WONDERED AT THE COLOUR BURNING IN HER CHEEKS.TURNING TO RESUME HER COURSE SHE MET FOXHALL CLIFFORD AND HURRIED ON.CLIFFORD OPENMOUTHED FOLLOWED HER WITH HIS EYES THEN HE LOOKED AFTERSELBY WHO HAD TURNED INTO THE BOULEVARD ST. GERMAIN TOWARD THE RUE DESEINE. THEN HE EXAMINED HIMSELF IN THE SHOP WINDOW. THE RESULT SEEMED TOBE UNSATISFACTORY.IM NOT A BEAUTY HE MUSED BUT NEITHER AM I A HOBGOBLIN. WHAT DOES SHEMEAN BY BLUSHING AT SELBY I NEVER BEFORE SAW HER LOOK AT A FELLOW IN MYLIFENEITHER HAS ANY ONE IN THE QUARTER. ANYWAY I CAN SWEAR SHE NEVERLOOKS AT ME AND GOODNESS KNOWS I HAVE DONE ALL THAT RESPECTFUL ADORATIONCAN DO.HE SIGHED AND MURMURING A PROPHECY CONCERNING THE SALVATION OF HISIMMORTAL SOUL SWUNG INTO THAT GRACEFUL LOUNGE WHICH AT ALL TIMESCHARACTERIZED CLIFFORD. WITH NO APPARENT EXERTION HE OVERTOOK SELBY ATTHE CORNER AND TOGETHER THEY CROSSED THE SUNLIT BOULEVARD AND SAT DOWNUNDER THE AWNING OF THE CAF DU CERCLE. CLIFFORD BOWED TO EVERYBODY ON THETERRACE SAYING YOU SHALL MEET THEM ALL LATER BUT NOW LET ME PRESENTYOU TO TWO OF THE SIGHTS OF PARIS MR. RICHARD ELLIOTT AND MR. STANLEYROWDEN.THE SIGHTS LOOKED AMIABLE AND TOOK VERMOUTH.YOU CUT THE STUDIO TODAY SAID ELLIOTT SUDDENLY TURNING ON CLIFFORDWHO AVOIDED HIS EYES.TO COMMUNE WITH NATURE OBSERVED ROWDEN.WHATS HER NAME THIS TIME ASKED ELLIOTT AND ROWDEN ANSWERED PROMPTLYNAME YVETTE NATIONALITY BRETONWRONG REPLIED CLIFFORD BLANDLY ITS RUE BARRE.THE SUBJECT CHANGED INSTANTLY AND SELBY LISTENED IN SURPRISE TO NAMESWHICH WERE NEW TO HIM AND EULOGIES ON THE LATEST PRIX DE ROME WINNER. HEWAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR OPINIONS BOLDLY EXPRESSED AND POINTS HONESTLYDEBATED ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE WAS MOSTLY SLANG BOTH ENGLISH AND FRENCH.HE LONGED FOR THE TIME WHEN HE TOO SHOULD BE PLUNGED INTO THE STRIFE FORFAME.THE BELLS OF ST. SULPICE STRUCK THE HOUR AND THE PALACE OF THE LUXEMBOURGANSWERED CHIME ON CHIME. WITH A GLANCE AT THE SUN DIPPING LOW IN THEGOLDEN DUST BEHIND THE PALAIS BOURBON THEY ROSE AND TURNING TO THE EASTCROSSED THE BOULEVARD ST. GERMAIN AND SAUNTERED TOWARD THE COLE DEMDECINE. AT THE CORNER A GIRL PASSED THEM WALKING HURRIEDLY. CLIFFORDSMIRKED ELLIOT AND ROWDEN WERE AGITATED BUT THEY ALL BOWED AND WITHOUTRAISING HER EYES SHE RETURNED THEIR SALUTE. BUT SELBY WHO HAD LAGGEDBEHIND FASCINATED BY SOME GAY SHOP WINDOW LOOKED UP TO MEET TWO OF THEBLUEST EYES HE HAD EVER SEEN. THE EYES WERE DROPPED IN AN INSTANT AND THEYOUNG FELLOW HASTENED TO OVERTAKE THE OTHERS.BY JOVE HE SAID DO YOU FELLOWS KNOW I HAVE JUST SEEN THE PRETTIESTGIRL AN EXCLAMATION BROKE FROM THE TRIO GLOOMY FOREBODING LIKE THECHORUS IN A GREEK PLAY.RUE BARREWHAT CRIED SELBY BEWILDERED.THE ONLY ANSWER WAS A VAGUE GESTURE FROM CLIFFORD.TWO HOURS LATER DURING DINNER CLIFFORD TURNED TO SELBY AND SAID YOUWANT TO ASK ME SOMETHING I CAN TELL BY THE WAY YOU FIDGET ABOUT.YES I DO HE SAID INNOCENTLY ENOUGH ITS ABOUT THAT GIRL. WHO ISSHEIN ROWDENS SMILE THERE WAS PITY IN ELLIOTTS BITTERNESS.HER NAME SAID CLIFFORD SOLEMNLY IS UNKNOWN TO ANY ONE AT LEAST HEADDED WITH MUCH CONSCIENTIOUSNESS AS FAR AS I CAN LEARN. EVERY FELLOW INTHE QUARTER BOWS TO HER AND SHE RETURNS THE SALUTE GRAVELY BUT NO MAN HASEVER BEEN KNOWN TO OBTAIN MORE THAN THAT. HER PROFESSION JUDGING FROM HERMUSICROLL IS THAT OF A PIANIST. HER RESIDENCE IS IN A SMALL AND HUMBLESTREET WHICH IS KEPT IN A PERPETUAL PROCESS OF REPAIR BY THE CITYAUTHORITIES AND FROM THE BLACK LETTERS PAINTED ON THE BARRIER WHICHDEFENDS THE STREET FROM TRAFFIC SHE HAS TAKEN THE NAME BY WHICH WE KNOWHERRUE BARRE. MR. ROWDEN IN HIS IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE FRENCHTONGUE CALLED OUR ATTENTION TO IT AS ROO BARRYI DIDNT SAID ROWDEN HOTLY.AND ROO BARRY OR RUE BARRE IS TODAY AN OBJECT OF ADORATION TO EVERYRAPIN IN THE QUARTERWE ARE NOT RAPINS CORRECTED ELLIOTT.I AM NOT RETURNED CLIFFORD AND I BEG TO CALL TO YOUR ATTENTIONSELBY THAT THESE TWO GENTLEMEN HAVE AT VARIOUS AND APPARENTLY UNFORTUNATEMOMENTS OFFERED TO LAY DOWN LIFE AND LIMB AT THE FEET OF RUE BARRE. THELADY POSSESSES A CHILLING SMILE WHICH SHE USES ON SUCH OCCASIONS ANDHERE HE BECAME GLOOMILY IMPRESSIVE I HAVE BEEN FORCED TO BELIEVE THATNEITHER THE SCHOLARLY GRACE OF MY FRIEND ELLIOTT NOR THE BUXOM BEAUTY OFMY FRIEND ROWDEN HAVE TOUCHED THAT HEART OF ICE.ELLIOTT AND ROWDEN BOILING WITH INDIGNATION CRIED OUT AND YOUI SAID CLIFFORD BLANDLY DO FEAR TO TREAD WHERE YOU RUSH IN.IITWENTYFOUR HOURS LATER SELBY HAD COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN RUE BARRE. DURINGTHE WEEK HE WORKED WITH MIGHT AND MAIN AT THE STUDIO AND SATURDAY NIGHTFOUND HIM SO TIRED THAT HE WENT TO BED BEFORE DINNER AND HAD A NIGHTMAREABOUT A RIVER OF YELLOW OCHRE IN WHICH HE WAS DROWNING. SUNDAY MORNINGAPROPOS OF NOTHING AT ALL HE THOUGHT OF RUE BARRE AND TEN SECONDSAFTERWARDS HE SAW HER. IT WAS AT THE FLOWERMARKET ON THE MARBLE BRIDGE.SHE WAS EXAMINING A POT OF PANSIES. THE GARDENER HAD EVIDENTLY THROWNHEART AND SOUL INTO THE TRANSACTION BUT RUE BARRE SHOOK HER HEAD.IT IS A QUESTION WHETHER SELBY WOULD HAVE STOPPED THEN AND THERE TOINSPECT A CABBAGEROSE HAD NOT CLIFFORD UNWOUND FOR HIM THE YARN OF THEPREVIOUS TUESDAY. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HIS CURIOSITY WAS PIQUED FOR WITHTHE EXCEPTION OF A HENTURKEY A BOY OF NINETEEN IS THE MOST OPENLYCURIOUS BIPED ALIVE. FROM TWENTY UNTIL DEATH HE TRIES TO CONCEAL IT. BUTTO BE FAIR TO SELBY IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE MARKET WAS ATTRACTIVE. UNDERA CLOUDLESS SKY THE FLOWERS WERE PACKED AND HEAPED ALONG THE MARBLE BRIDGETO THE PARAPET. THE AIR WAS SOFT THE SUN SPUN A SHADOWY LACEWORK AMONGTHE PALMS AND GLOWED IN THE HEARTS OF A THOUSAND ROSES. SPRING HADCOMEWAS IN FULL TIDE. THE WATERING CARTS AND SPRINKLERS SPREADFRESHNESS OVER THE BOULEVARD THE SPARROWS HAD BECOME VULGARLY OBTRUSIVEAND THE CREDULOUS SEINE ANGLER ANXIOUSLY FOLLOWED HIS GAUDY QUILL FLOATINGAMONG THE SOAPSUDS OF THE LAVOIRS. THE WHITESPIKED CHESTNUTS CLAD INTENDER GREEN VIBRATED WITH THE HUM OF BEES. SHODDY BUTTERFLIES FLAUNTEDTHEIR WINTER RAGS AMONG THE HELIOTROPE. THERE WAS A SMELL OF FRESH EARTHIN THE AIR AN ECHO OF THE WOODLAND BROOK IN THE RIPPLE OF THE SEINE ANDSWALLOWS SOARED AND SKIMMED AMONG THE ANCHORED RIVER CRAFT. SOMEWHERE IN AWINDOW A CAGED BIRD WAS SINGING ITS HEART OUT TO THE SKY.SELBY LOOKED AT THE CABBAGEROSE AND THEN AT THE SKY. SOMETHING IN THESONG OF THE CAGED BIRD MAY HAVE MOVED HIM OR PERHAPS IT WAS THATDANGEROUS SWEETNESS IN THE AIR OF MAY.AT FIRST HE WAS HARDLY CONSCIOUS THAT HE HAD STOPPED THEN HE WAS SCARCELYCONSCIOUS WHY HE HAD STOPPED THEN HE THOUGHT HE WOULD MOVE ON THEN HETHOUGHT HE WOULDNT THEN HE LOOKED AT RUE BARRE.THE GARDENER SAID MADEMOISELLE THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY A FINE POT OFPANSIES.RUE BARRE SHOOK HER HEAD.THE GARDENER SMILED. SHE EVIDENTLY DID NOT WANT THE PANSIES. SHE HADBOUGHT MANY POTS OF PANSIES THERE TWO OR THREE EVERY SPRING AND NEVERARGUED. WHAT DID SHE WANT THEN THE PANSIES WERE EVIDENTLY A FEELER TOWARDA MORE IMPORTANT TRANSACTION. THE GARDENER RUBBED HIS HANDS AND GAZEDABOUT HIM.THESE TULIPS ARE MAGNIFICENT HE OBSERVED AND THESE HYACINTHS HEFELL INTO A TRANCE AT THE MERE SIGHT OF THE SCENTED THICKETS.THAT MURMURED RUE POINTING TO A SPLENDID ROSEBUSH WITH HER FURLEDPARASOL BUT IN SPITE OF HER HER VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE. SELBY NOTICEDIT MORE SHAME TO HIM THAT HE WAS LISTENING AND THE GARDENER NOTICED ITAND BURYING HIS NOSE IN THE ROSES SCENTED A BARGAIN. STILL TO DO HIMJUSTICE HE DID NOT ADD A CENTIME TO THE HONEST VALUE OF THE PLANT FORAFTER ALL RUE WAS PROBABLY POOR AND ANY ONE COULD SEE SHE WAS CHARMING.FIFTY FRANCS MADEMOISELLE.THE GARDENERS TONE WAS GRAVE. RUE FELT THAT ARGUMENT WOULD BE WASTED.THEY BOTH STOOD SILENT FOR A MOMENT. THE GARDENER DID NOT EULOGIZE HISPRIZETHE ROSETREE WAS GORGEOUS AND ANY ONE COULD SEE IT.I WILL TAKE THE PANSIES SAID THE GIRL AND DREW TWO FRANCS FROM A WORNPURSE. THEN SHE LOOKED UP. A TEARDROP STOOD IN THE WAY REFRACTING THELIGHT LIKE A DIAMOND BUT AS IT ROLLED INTO A LITTLE CORNER BY HER NOSE AVISION OF SELBY REPLACED IT AND WHEN A BRUSH OF THE HANDKERCHIEF HADCLEARED THE STARTLED BLUE EYES SELBY HIMSELF APPEARED VERY MUCHEMBARRASSED. HE INSTANTLY LOOKED UP INTO THE SKY APPARENTLY DEVOURED WITHA THIRST FOR ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH AND AS HE CONTINUED HIS INVESTIGATIONSFOR FULLY FIVE MINUTES THE GARDENER LOOKED UP TOO AND SO DID APOLICEMAN. THEN SELBY LOOKED AT THE TIPS OF HIS BOOTS THE GARDENER LOOKEDAT HIM AND THE POLICEMAN SLOUCHED ON. RUE BARRE HAD BEEN GONE SOME TIME.WHAT SAID THE GARDENER MAY I OFFER MONSIEURSELBY NEVER KNEW WHY BUT HE SUDDENLY BEGAN TO BUY FLOWERS. THE GARDENERWAS ELECTRIFIED. NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SOLD SO MANY FLOWERS NEVER AT SUCHSATISFYING PRICES AND NEVER NEVER WITH SUCH ABSOLUTE UNANIMITY OFOPINION WITH A CUSTOMER. BUT HE MISSED THE BARGAINING THE ARGUING THECALLING OF HEAVEN TO WITNESS. THE TRANSACTION LACKED SPICE.THESE TULIPS ARE MAGNIFICENTTHEY ARE CRIED SELBY WARMLY.BUT ALAS THEY ARE DEAR.I WILL TAKE THEM.DIEU MURMURED THE GARDENER IN A PERSPIRATION HES MADDER THAN MOSTENGLISHMEN.THIS CACTUSIS GORGEOUSALASSEND IT WITH THE REST.THE GARDENER BRACED HIMSELF AGAINST THE RIVER WALL.THAT SPLENDID ROSEBUSH HE BEGAN FAINTLY.THAT IS A BEAUTY. I BELIEVE IT IS FIFTY FRANCSHE STOPPED VERY RED. THE GARDENER RELISHED HIS CONFUSION. THEN A SUDDENCOOL SELFPOSSESSION TOOK THE PLACE OF HIS MOMENTARY CONFUSION AND HE HELDTHE GARDENER WITH HIS EYE AND BULLIED HIM.ILL TAKE THAT BUSH. WHY DID NOT THE YOUNG LADY BUY ITMADEMOISELLE IS NOT WEALTHY.HOW DO YOU KNOWDAME I SELL HER MANY PANSIES PANSIES ARE NOT EXPENSIVE.THOSE ARE THE PANSIES SHE BOUGHTTHESE MONSIEUR THE BLUE AND GOLD.THEN YOU INTEND TO SEND THEM TO HERAT MIDDAY AFTER THE MARKET.TAKE THIS ROSEBUSH WITH THEM ANDHERE HE GLARED AT THEGARDENERDONT YOU DARE SAY FROM WHOM THEY CAME. THE GARDENERS EYESWERE LIKE SAUCERS BUT SELBY CALM AND VICTORIOUS SAID SEND THE OTHERSTO THE HTEL DU SNAT  RUE DE TOURNON. I WILL LEAVE DIRECTIONS WITH THECONCIERGE.THEN HE BUTTONED HIS GLOVE WITH MUCH DIGNITY AND STALKED OFF BUT WHENWELL AROUND THE CORNER AND HIDDEN FROM THE GARDENERS VIEW THE CONVICTIONTHAT HE WAS AN IDIOT CAME HOME TO HIM IN A FURIOUS BLUSH. TEN MINUTESLATER HE SAT IN HIS ROOM IN THE HTEL DU SNAT REPEATING WITH AN IMBECILESMILE WHAT AN ASS I AM WHAT AN ASSAN HOUR LATER FOUND HIM IN THE SAME CHAIR IN THE SAME POSITION HIS HATAND GLOVES STILL ON HIS STICK IN HIS HAND BUT HE WAS SILENT APPARENTLYLOST IN CONTEMPLATION OF HIS BOOT TOES AND HIS SMILE WAS LESS IMBECILEAND EVEN A BIT RETROSPECTIVE.IIIABOUT FIVE OCLOCK THAT AFTERNOON THE LITTLE SADEYED WOMAN WHO FILLS THEPOSITION OF CONCIERGE AT THE HTEL DU SNAT HELD UP HER HANDS IN AMAZEMENTTO SEE A WAGONLOAD OF FLOWERBEARING SHRUBS DRAW UP BEFORE THE DOORWAY.SHE CALLED JOSEPH THE INTEMPERATE GARON WHO WHILE CALCULATING THEVALUE OF THE FLOWERS IN PETITS VERRES GLOOMILY DISCLAIMED ANY KNOWLEDGEAS TO THEIR DESTINATION.VOYONS SAID THE LITTLE CONCIERGE CHERCHONS LA FEMMEYOU HE SUGGESTED.THE LITTLE WOMAN STOOD A MOMENT PENSIVE AND THEN SIGHED. JOSEPH CARESSEDHIS NOSE A NOSE WHICH FOR GAUDINESS COULD VIE WITH ANY FLORAL DISPLAY.THEN THE GARDENER CAME IN HAT IN HAND AND A FEW MINUTES LATER SELBYSTOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS ROOM HIS COAT OFF HIS SHIRTSLEEVES ROLLEDUP. THE CHAMBER ORIGINALLY CONTAINED BESIDES THE FURNITURE ABOUT TWOSQUARE FEET OF WALKING ROOM AND NOW THIS WAS OCCUPIED BY A CACTUS. THEBED GROANED UNDER CRATES OF PANSIES LILIES AND HELIOTROPE THE LOUNGE WASCOVERED WITH HYACINTHS AND TULIPS AND THE WASHSTAND SUPPORTED A SPECIESOF YOUNG TREE WARRANTED TO BEAR FLOWERS AT SOME TIME OR OTHER.CLIFFORD CAME IN A LITTLE LATER FELL OVER A BOX OF SWEET PEAS SWORE ALITTLE APOLOGIZED AND THEN AS THE FULL SPLENDOUR OF THE FLORAL FTEBURST UPON HIM SAT DOWN IN ASTONISHMENT UPON A GERANIUM. THE GERANIUM WASA WRECK BUT SELBY SAID DONT MIND AND GLARED AT THE CACTUS.ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE A BALL DEMANDED CLIFFORD.NNOIM VERY FOND OF FLOWERS SAID SELBY BUT THE STATEMENT LACKEDENTHUSIASM.I SHOULD IMAGINE SO. THEN AFTER A SILENCE THATS A FINE CACTUS.SELBY CONTEMPLATED THE CACTUS TOUCHED IT WITH THE AIR OF A CONNOISSEURAND PRICKED HIS THUMB.CLIFFORD POKED A PANSY WITH HIS STICK. THEN JOSEPH CAME IN WITH THE BILLANNOUNCING THE SUM TOTAL IN A LOUD VOICE PARTLY TO IMPRESS CLIFFORDPARTLY TO INTIMIDATE SELBY INTO DISGORGING A POURBOIRE WHICH HE WOULDSHARE IF HE CHOSE WITH THE GARDENER. CLIFFORD TRIED TO PRETEND THAT HEHAD NOT HEARD WHILE SELBY PAID BILL AND TRIBUTE WITHOUT A MURMUR. THEN HELOUNGED BACK INTO THE ROOM WITH AN ATTEMPT AT INDIFFERENCE WHICH FAILEDENTIRELY WHEN HE TORE HIS TROUSERS ON THE CACTUS.CLIFFORD MADE SOME COMMONPLACE REMARK LIGHTED A CIGARETTE AND LOOKED OUTOF THE WINDOW TO GIVE SELBY A CHANCE. SELBY TRIED TO TAKE IT BUT GETTINGAS FAR ASYES SPRING IS HERE AT LAST FROZE SOLID. HE LOOKED AT THEBACK OF CLIFFORDS HEAD. IT EXPRESSED VOLUMES. THOSE LITTLE PERKEDUP EARSSEEMED TINGLING WITH SUPPRESSED GLEE. HE MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT TO MASTERTHE SITUATION AND JUMPED UP TO REACH FOR SOME RUSSIAN CIGARETTES AS ANINCENTIVE TO CONVERSATION BUT WAS FOILED BY THE CACTUS TO WHOM AGAIN HEFELL A PREY. THE LAST STRAW WAS ADDED.DAMN THE CACTUS. THIS OBSERVATION WAS WRUNG FROM SELBY AGAINST HISWILLAGAINST HIS OWN INSTINCT OF SELFPRESERVATION BUT THE THORNS ONTHE CACTUS WERE LONG AND SHARP AND AT THEIR REPEATED PRICK HIS PENTUPWRATH ESCAPED. IT WAS TOO LATE NOW IT WAS DONE AND CLIFFORD HAD WHEELEDAROUND.SEE HERE SELBY WHY THE DEUCE DID YOU BUY THOSE FLOWERSIM FOND OF THEM SAID SELBY.WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THEM YOU CANT SLEEP HERE.I COULD IF YOUD HELP ME TAKE THE PANSIES OFF THE BED.WHERE CAN YOU PUT THEMCOULDNT I GIVE THEM TO THE CONCIERGEAS SOON AS HE SAID IT HE REGRETTED IT. WHAT IN HEAVENS NAME WOULDCLIFFORD THINK OF HIM HE HAD HEARD THE AMOUNT OF THE BILL. WOULD HEBELIEVE THAT HE HAD INVESTED IN THESE LUXURIES AS A TIMID DECLARATION TOHIS CONCIERGE AND WOULD THE LATIN QUARTER COMMENT UPON IT IN THEIR OWNBRUTAL FASHION HE DREADED RIDICULE AND HE KNEW CLIFFORDS REPUTATION.THEN SOMEBODY KNOCKED.SELBY LOOKED AT CLIFFORD WITH A HUNTED EXPRESSION WHICH TOUCHED THAT YOUNGMANS HEART. IT WAS A CONFESSION AND AT THE SAME TIME A SUPPLICATION.CLIFFORD JUMPED UP THREADED HIS WAY THROUGH THE FLORAL LABYRINTH ANDPUTTING AN EYE TO THE CRACK OF THE DOOR SAID WHO THE DEVIL IS ITTHIS GRACEFUL STYLE OF RECEPTION IS INDIGENOUS TO THE QUARTER.ITS ELLIOTT HE SAID LOOKING BACK AND ROWDEN TOO AND THEIRBULLDOGS. THEN HE ADDRESSED THEM THROUGH THE CRACK.SIT DOWN ON THE STAIRS SELBY AND I ARE COMING OUT DIRECTLY.DISCRETION IS A VIRTUE. THE LATIN QUARTER POSSESSES FEW AND DISCRETIONSELDOM FIGURES ON THE LIST. THEY SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO WHISTLE.PRESENTLY ROWDEN CALLED OUT I SMELL FLOWERS. THEY FEAST WITHINYOU OUGHT TO KNOW SELBY BETTER THAN THAT GROWLED CLIFFORD BEHIND THEDOOR WHILE THE OTHER HURRIEDLY EXCHANGED HIS TORN TROUSERS FOR OTHERS.WE KNOW SELBY SAID ELLIOTT WITH EMPHASIS.YES SAID ROWDEN HE GIVES RECEPTIONS WITH FLORAL DECORATIONS ANDINVITES CLIFFORD WHILE WE SIT ON THE STAIRS.YES WHILE THE YOUTH AND BEAUTY OF THE QUARTER REVEL SUGGESTED ROWDENTHEN WITH SUDDEN MISGIVING IS ODETTE THERESEE HERE DEMANDED ELLIOTT IS COLETTE THERETHEN HE RAISED HIS VOICE IN A PLAINTIVE HOWL ARE YOU THERE COLETTEWHILE IM KICKING MY HEELS ON THESE TILESCLIFFORD IS CAPABLE OF ANYTHING SAID ROWDEN HIS NATURE IS SOUREDSINCE RUE BARRE SAT ON HIM.ELLIOTT RAISED HIS VOICE I SAY YOU FELLOWS WE SAW SOME FLOWERS CARRIEDINTO RUE BARRES HOUSE AT NOON.POSIES AND ROSES SPECIFIED ROWDEN.PROBABLY FOR HER ADDED ELLIOTT CARESSING HIS BULLDOG.CLIFFORD TURNED WITH SUDDEN SUSPICION UPON SELBY. THE LATTER HUMMED ATUNE SELECTED A PAIR OF GLOVES AND CHOOSING A DOZEN CIGARETTES PLACEDTHEM IN A CASE. THEN WALKING OVER TO THE CACTUS HE DELIBERATELY DETACHEDA BLOSSOM DREW IT THROUGH HIS BUTTONHOLE AND PICKING UP HAT AND STICKSMILED UPON CLIFFORD AT WHICH THE LATTER WAS MIGHTILY TROUBLED.IVMONDAY MORNING AT JULIANS STUDENTS FOUGHT FOR PLACES STUDENTS WITHPRIOR CLAIMS DROVE AWAY OTHERS WHO HAD BEEN ANXIOUSLY SQUATTING ON COVETEDTABOURETS SINCE THE DOOR WAS OPENED IN HOPES OF APPROPRIATING THEM ATROLLCALL STUDENTS SQUABBLED OVER PALETTES BRUSHES PORTFOLIOS OR RENTTHE AIR WITH DEMANDS FOR CICERI AND BREAD.

ELLIOTTWAS READING THE GIL BLAS FROM WHICH HE SEEMED TO EXTRACT AMUSEMENT BUTDEEMING BOISTEROUS MIRTH UNSUITABLE TO CLIFFORDS STATE OF MIND SUBDUEDHIS AMUSEMENT TO A SERIES OF DISCREET SMILES. THE LATTER MOODILY AWARE OFTHIS SAID NOTHING BUT LEADING THE WAY INTO THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENSINSTALLED HIMSELF UPON A BENCH BY THE NORTHERN TERRACE AND SURVEYED THELANDSCAPE WITH DISFAVOUR.

HER GOWN WAS SPOTLESS AND HER BIGSTRAW HAT TIPPED A LITTLE FROM THE WHITE FOREHEAD THREW A SHADOW ACROSSHER EYES.ELLIOTT STOOD UP AND BOWED. CLIFFORD REMOVED HIS HEADCOVERING WITH AN AIRSO PLAINTIVE SO APPEALING SO UTTERLY HUMBLE THAT RUE BARRE SMILED.THE SMILE WAS DELICIOUS AND WHEN CLIFFORD INCAPABLE OF SUSTAINING HIMSELFON HIS LEGS FROM SHEER ASTONISHMENT TOPPLED SLIGHTLY SHE SMILED AGAIN INSPITE OF HERSELF. A FEW MOMENTS LATER SHE TOOK A CHAIR ON THE TERRACE ANDDRAWING A BOOK FROM HER MUSICROLL TURNED THE PAGES FOUND THE PLACE ANDTHEN PLACING IT OPEN DOWNWARDS IN HER LAP SIGHED A LITTLE SMILED ALITTLE AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE CITY. SHE HAD ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN FOXHALLCLIFFORD.AFTER A WHILE SHE TOOK UP HER BOOK AGAIN BUT INSTEAD OF READING BEGAN TOADJUST A ROSE IN HER CORSAGE. THE ROSE WAS BIG AND RED.

THEN THE DEVIL OF RECKLESSNESS SEIZING HIM HE SAT DOWN ANDOFFERED HIMSELF SOUL AND BODY GOODS AND CHATTELS. AND ALL THE TIME HEKNEW HE WAS A FOOL AND THAT INFATUATION IS NOT LOVE AND THAT EACH WORD HEUTTERED BOUND HIM IN HONOUR FROM WHICH THERE WAS NO ESCAPE. AND ALL THETIME ELLIOTT WAS SCOWLING DOWN ON THE FOUNTAIN PLAZA AND SAVAGELY CHECKINGBOTH BULLDOGS FROM THEIR DESIRE TO RUSH TO CLIFFORDS RESCUEFOR EVENTHEY FELT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG AS ELLIOTT STORMED WITHIN HIMSELF ANDGROWLED MALEDICTIONS.WHEN CLIFFORD FINISHED HE FINISHED IN A GLOW OF EXCITEMENT BUT RUEBARRES RESPONSE WAS LONG IN COMING AND HIS ARDOUR COOLED WHILE THESITUATION SLOWLY ASSUMED ITS JUST PROPORTIONS. THEN REGRET BEGAN TO CREEPIN BUT HE PUT THAT ASIDE AND BROKE OUT AGAIN IN PROTESTATIONS. AT THEFIRST WORD RUE BARRE CHECKED HIM.I THANK YOU SHE SAID SPEAKING VERY GRAVELY. NO MAN HAS EVER BEFOREOFFERED ME MARRIAGE. SHE TURNED AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE CITY. AFTER AWHILE SHE SPOKE AGAIN. YOU OFFER ME A GREAT DEAL. I AM ALONE I HAVENOTHING I AM NOTHING. SHE TURNED AGAIN AND LOOKED AT PARIS BRILLIANTFAIR IN THE SUNSHINE OF A PERFECT DAY. HE FOLLOWED HER EYES.OH SHE MURMURED IT IS HARDHARD TO WORK ALWAYSALWAYS ALONE WITHNEVER A FRIEND YOU CAN HAVE IN HONOUR AND THE LOVE THAT IS OFFERED MEANSTHE STREETS THE BOULEVARDWHEN PASSION IS DEAD. I KNOW ITWE KNOWITWE OTHERS WHO HAVE NOTHINGHAVE NO ONE AND WHO GIVE OURSELVESUNQUESTIONINGWHEN WE LOVEYES UNQUESTIONINGHEART AND SOUL KNOWINGTHE END.SHE TOUCHED THE ROSE AT HER BREAST. FOR A MOMENT SHE SEEMED TO FORGET HIMTHEN QUIETLYI THANK YOU I AM VERY GRATEFUL. SHE OPENED THE BOOK ANDPLUCKING A PETAL FROM THE ROSE DROPPED IT BETWEEN THE LEAVES. THENLOOKING UP SHE SAID GENTLY I CANNOT ACCEPT.VIT TOOK CLIFFORD A MONTH TO ENTIRELY RECOVER ALTHOUGH AT THE END OF THEFIRST WEEK HE WAS PRONOUNCED CONVALESCENT BY ELLIOTT WHO WAS ANAUTHORITY AND HIS CONVALESCENCE WAS AIDED BY THE CORDIALITY WITH WHICHRUE BARRE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS SOLEMN SALUTES. FORTY TIMES A DAY HE BLESSEDRUE BARRE FOR HER REFUSAL AND THANKED HIS LUCKY STARS AND AT THE SAMETIME OH WONDROUS HEART OF OURSHE SUFFERED THE TORTURES OF THEBLIGHTED.ELLIOTT WAS ANNOYED PARTLY BY CLIFFORDS RETICENCE PARTLY BY THEUNEXPLAINABLE THAW IN THE FRIGIDITY OF RUE BARRE. AT THEIR FREQUENTENCOUNTERS WHEN SHE TRIPPING ALONG THE RUE DE SEINE WITH MUSICROLL ANDBIG STRAW HAT WOULD PASS CLIFFORD AND HIS FAMILIARS STEERING AN EASTERLYCOURSE TO THE CAF VACHETTE AND AT THE RESPECTFUL UNCOVERING OF THE BANDWOULD COLOUR AND SMILE AT CLIFFORD ELLIOTTS SLUMBERING SUSPICIONS AWOKE.BUT HE NEVER FOUND OUT ANYTHING AND FINALLY GAVE IT UP AS BEYOND HISCOMPREHENSION MERELY QUALIFYING CLIFFORD AS AN IDIOT AND RESERVING HISOPINION OF RUE BARRE. AND ALL THIS TIME SELBY WAS JEALOUS. AT FIRST HEREFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT TO HIMSELF AND CUT THE STUDIO FOR A DAY IN THECOUNTRY BUT THE WOODS AND FIELDS OF COURSE AGGRAVATED HIS CASE AND THEBROOKS BABBLED OF RUE BARRE AND THE MOWERS CALLING TO EACH OTHER ACROSSTHE MEADOW ENDED IN A QUAVERING RUE BARREE THAT DAY SPENT IN THECOUNTRY MADE HIM ANGRY FOR A WEEK AND HE WORKED SULKILY AT JULIANS ALLTHE TIME TORMENTED BY A DESIRE TO KNOW WHERE CLIFFORD WAS AND WHAT HEMIGHT BE DOING. THIS CULMINATED IN AN ERRATIC STROLL ON SUNDAY WHICH ENDEDAT THE FLOWERMARKET ON THE PONT AU CHANGE BEGAN AGAIN WAS GLOOMILYEXTENDED TO THE MORGUE AND AGAIN ENDED AT THE MARBLE BRIDGE. IT WOULDNEVER DO AND SELBY FELT IT SO HE WENT TO SEE CLIFFORD WHO WASCONVALESCING ON MINT JULEPS IN HIS GARDEN.THEY SAT DOWN TOGETHER AND DISCUSSED MORALS AND HUMAN HAPPINESS AND EACHFOUND THE OTHER MOST ENTERTAINING ONLY SELBY FAILED TO PUMP CLIFFORD TOTHE OTHERS UNFEIGNED AMUSEMENT. BUT THE JULEPS SPREAD BALM ON THE STINGOF JEALOUSY AND TRICKLED HOPE TO THE BLIGHTED AND WHEN SELBY SAID HEMUST GO CLIFFORD WENT TOO AND WHEN SELBY NOT TO BE OUTDONE INSISTED ONACCOMPANYING CLIFFORD BACK TO HIS DOOR CLIFFORD DETERMINED TO SEE SELBYBACK HALF WAY AND THEN FINDING IT HARD TO PART THEY DECIDED TO DINETOGETHER AND FLIT. TO FLIT A VERB APPLIED TO CLIFFORDS NOCTURNALPROWLS EXPRESSED PERHAPS AS WELL AS ANYTHING THE GAIETY PROPOSED.DINNER WAS ORDERED AT MIGNONS AND WHILE SELBY INTERVIEWED THE CHEFCLIFFORD KEPT A FATHERLY EYE ON THE BUTLER. THE DINNER WAS A SUCCESS ORWAS OF THE SORT GENERALLY TERMED A SUCCESS. TOWARD THE DESSERT SELBY HEARDSOME ONE SAY AS AT A GREAT DISTANCE KID SELBY DRUNK AS A LORD.A GROUP OF MEN PASSED NEAR THEM IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE SHOOK HANDS ANDLAUGHED A GREAT DEAL AND THAT EVERYBODY WAS VERY WITTY. THERE WASCLIFFORD OPPOSITE SWEARING UNDYING CONFIDENCE IN HIS CHUM SELBY AND THERESEEMED TO BE OTHERS THERE EITHER SEATED BESIDE THEM OR CONTINUALLYPASSING WITH THE SWISH OF SKIRTS ON THE POLISHED FLOOR. THE PERFUME OFROSES THE RUSTLE OF FANS THE TOUCH OF ROUNDED ARMS AND THE LAUGHTER GREWVAGUER AND VAGUER. THE ROOM SEEMED ENVELOPED IN MIST. THEN ALL IN AMOMENT EACH OBJECT STOOD OUT PAINFULLY DISTINCT ONLY FORMS AND VISAGESWERE DISTORTED AND VOICES PIERCING. HE DREW HIMSELF UP CALM GRAVE FORTHE MOMENT MASTER OF HIMSELF BUT VERY DRUNK. HE KNEW HE WAS DRUNK ANDWAS AS GUARDED AND ALERT AS KEENLY SUSPICIOUS OF HIMSELF AS HE WOULD HAVEBEEN OF A THIEF AT HIS ELBOW. HIS SELFCOMMAND ENABLED CLIFFORD TO HOLDHIS HEAD SAFELY UNDER SOME RUNNING WATER AND REPAIR TO THE STREETCONSIDERABLY THE WORSE FOR WEAR BUT NEVER SUSPECTING THAT HIS COMPANIONWAS DRUNK. FOR A TIME HE KEPT HIS SELFCOMMAND. HIS FACE WAS ONLY A BITPALER A BIT TIGHTER THAN USUAL HE WAS ONLY A TRIFLE SLOWER AND MOREFASTIDIOUS IN HIS SPEECH. IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN HE LEFT CLIFFORD PEACEFULLYSLUMBERING IN SOMEBODYS ARMCHAIR WITH A LONG SUEDE GLOVE DANGLING INHIS HAND AND A PLUMY BOA TWISTED ABOUT HIS NECK TO PROTECT HIS THROAT FROMDRAFTS. HE WALKED THROUGH THE HALL AND DOWN THE STAIRS AND FOUND HIMSELFON THE SIDEWALK IN A QUARTER HE DID NOT KNOW. MECHANICALLY HE LOOKED UP ATTHE NAME OF THE STREET. THE NAME WAS NOT FAMILIAR. HE TURNED AND STEEREDHIS COURSE TOWARD SOME LIGHTS CLUSTERED AT THE END OF THE STREET. THEYPROVED FARTHER AWAY THAN HE HAD ANTICIPATED AND AFTER A LONG QUEST HECAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS EYES HAD BEEN MYSTERIOUSLY REMOVED FROMTHEIR PROPER PLACES AND HAD BEEN RESET ON EITHER SIDE OF HIS HEAD LIKETHOSE OF A BIRD. IT GRIEVED HIM TO THINK OF THE INCONVENIENCE THISTRANSFORMATION MIGHT OCCASION HIM AND HE ATTEMPTED TO COCK UP HIS HEADHENLIKE TO TEST THE MOBILITY OF HIS NECK. THEN AN IMMENSE DESPAIR STOLEOVER HIMTEARS GATHERED IN THE TEARDUCTS HIS HEART MELTED AND HECOLLIDED WITH A TREE. THIS SHOCKED HIM INTO COMPREHENSION HE STIFLED THEVIOLENT TENDERNESS IN HIS BREAST PICKED UP HIS HAT AND MOVED ON MOREBRISKLY. HIS MOUTH WAS WHITE AND DRAWN HIS TEETH TIGHTLY CLINCHED. HEHELD HIS COURSE PRETTY WELL AND STRAYED BUT LITTLE AND AFTER ANAPPARENTLY INTERMINABLE LENGTH OF TIME FOUND HIMSELF PASSING A LINE OFCABS. THE BRILLIANT LAMPS RED YELLOW AND GREEN ANNOYED HIM AND HE FELTIT MIGHT BE PLEASANT TO DEMOLISH THEM WITH HIS CANE BUT MASTERING THISIMPULSE HE PASSED ON. LATER AN IDEA STRUCK HIM THAT IT WOULD SAVE FATIGUETO TAKE A CAB AND HE STARTED BACK WITH THAT INTENTION BUT THE CABSSEEMED ALREADY SO FAR AWAY AND THE LANTERNS WERE SO BRIGHT AND CONFUSINGTHAT HE GAVE IT UP AND PULLING HIMSELF TOGETHER LOOKED AROUND.A SHADOW A MASS HUGE UNDEFINED ROSE TO HIS RIGHT. HE RECOGNIZED THEARC DE TRIOMPHE AND GRAVELY SHOOK HIS CANE AT IT. ITS SIZE ANNOYED HIM. HEFELT IT WAS TOO BIG. THEN HE HEARD SOMETHING FALL CLATTERING TO THEPAVEMENT AND THOUGHT PROBABLY IT WAS HIS CANE BUT IT DIDNT MUCH MATTER.WHEN HE HAD MASTERED HIMSELF AND REGAINED CONTROL OF HIS RIGHT LEG WHICHBETRAYED SYMPTOMS OF INSUBORDINATION HE FOUND HIMSELF TRAVERSING THEPLACE DE LA CONCORDE AT A PACE WHICH THREATENED TO LAND HIM AT THEMADELEINE. THIS WOULD NEVER DO. HE TURNED SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT ANDCROSSING THE BRIDGE PASSED THE PALAIS BOURBON AT A TROT AND WHEELED INTOTHE BOULEVARD ST. GERMAIN. HE GOT ON WELL ENOUGH ALTHOUGH THE SIZE OF THEWAR OFFICE STRUCK HIM AS A PERSONAL INSULT AND HE MISSED HIS CANE WHICHIT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASANT TO DRAG ALONG THE IRON RAILINGS AS HE PASSED.IT OCCURRED TO HIM HOWEVER TO SUBSTITUTE HIS HAT BUT WHEN HE FOUND ITHE FORGOT WHAT HE WANTED IT FOR AND REPLACED IT UPON HIS HEAD WITHGRAVITY. THEN HE WAS OBLIGED TO BATTLE WITH A VIOLENT INCLINATION TO SITDOWN AND WEEP. THIS LASTED UNTIL HE CAME TO THE RUE DE RENNES BUT THEREHE BECAME ABSORBED IN CONTEMPLATING THE DRAGON ON THE BALCONY OVERHANGINGTHE COUR DU DRAGON AND TIME SLIPPED AWAY UNTIL HE REMEMBERED VAGUELY THATHE HAD NO BUSINESS THERE AND MARCHED OFF AGAIN. IT WAS SLOW WORK. THEINCLINATION TO SIT DOWN AND WEEP HAD GIVEN PLACE TO A DESIRE FOR SOLITARYAND DEEP REFLECTION. HERE HIS RIGHT LEG FORGOT ITS OBEDIENCE AND ATTACKINGTHE LEFT OUTFLANKED IT AND BROUGHT HIM UP AGAINST A WOODEN BOARD WHICHSEEMED TO BAR HIS PATH. HE TRIED TO WALK AROUND IT BUT FOUND THE STREETCLOSED. HE TRIED TO PUSH IT OVER AND FOUND HE COULDNT. THEN HE NOTICED ARED LANTERN STANDING ON A PILE OF PAVINGSTONES INSIDE THE BARRIER. THISWAS PLEASANT. HOW WAS HE TO GET HOME IF THE BOULEVARD WAS BLOCKED BUT HEWAS NOT ON THE BOULEVARD. HIS TREACHEROUS RIGHT LEG HAD BEGUILED HIM INTOA DETOUR FOR THERE BEHIND HIM LAY THE BOULEVARD WITH ITS ENDLESS LINE OFLAMPSAND HERE WHAT WAS THIS NARROW DILAPIDATED STREET PILED UP WITHEARTH AND MORTAR AND HEAPS OF STONE HE LOOKED UP. WRITTEN IN STARINGBLACK LETTERS ON THE BARRIER WASRUE BARRE.HE SAT DOWN. TWO POLICEMEN WHOM HE KNEW CAME BY AND ADVISED HIM TO GET UPBUT HE ARGUED THE QUESTION FROM A STANDPOINT OF PERSONAL TASTE AND THEYPASSED ON LAUGHING. FOR HE WAS AT THAT MOMENT ABSORBED IN A PROBLEM. ITWAS HOW TO SEE RUE BARRE. SHE WAS SOMEWHERE OR OTHER IN THAT BIG HOUSEWITH THE IRON BALCONIES AND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED BUT WHAT OF THAT THESIMPLE IDEA STRUCK HIM TO SHOUT UNTIL SHE CAME. THIS IDEA WAS REPLACED BYANOTHER EQUALLY LUCIDTO HAMMER ON THE DOOR UNTIL SHE CAME BUT FINALLYREJECTING BOTH OF THESE AS TOO UNCERTAIN HE DECIDED TO CLIMB INTO THEBALCONY AND OPENING A WINDOW POLITELY INQUIRE FOR RUE BARRE. THERE WASBUT ONE LIGHTED WINDOW IN THE HOUSE THAT HE COULD SEE. IT WAS ON THESECOND FLOOR AND TOWARD THIS HE CAST HIS EYES. THEN MOUNTING THE WOODENBARRIER AND CLAMBERING OVER THE PILES OF STONES HE REACHED THE SIDEWALKAND LOOKED UP AT THE FAADE FOR A FOOTHOLD. IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE. BUT ASUDDEN FURY SEIZED HIM A BLIND DRUNKEN OBSTINACY AND THE BLOOD RUSHEDTO HIS HEAD LEAPING BEATING IN HIS EARS LIKE THE DULL THUNDER OF ANOCEAN. HE SET HIS TEETH AND SPRINGING AT A WINDOWSILL DRAGGED HIMSELFUP AND HUNG TO THE IRON BARS. THEN REASON FLED THERE SURGED IN HIS BRAINTHE SOUND OF MANY VOICES HIS HEART LEAPED UP BEATING A MAD TATTOO ANDGRIPPING AT CORNICE AND LEDGE HE WORKED HIS WAY ALONG THE FAADE CLUNG TOPIPES AND SHUTTERS AND DRAGGED HIMSELF UP OVER AND INTO THE BALCONY BYTHE LIGHTED WINDOW. HIS HAT FELL OFF AND ROLLED AGAINST THE PANE. FOR AMOMENT HE LEANED BREATHLESS AGAINST THE RAILINGTHEN THE WINDOW WASSLOWLY OPENED FROM WITHIN.THEY STARED AT EACH OTHER FOR SOME TIME. PRESENTLY THE GIRL TOOK TWOUNSTEADY STEPS BACK INTO THE ROOM. HE SAW HER FACEALL CRIMSONEDNOWHE SAW HER SINK INTO A CHAIR BY THE LAMPLIT TABLE AND WITHOUT AWORD HE FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM CLOSING THE BIG DOORLIKE PANES BEHINDHIM. THEN THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN SILENCE.THE ROOM WAS SMALL AND WHITE EVERYTHING WAS WHITE ABOUT ITTHECURTAINED BED THE LITTLE WASHSTAND IN THE CORNER THE BARE WALLS THECHINA LAMPAND HIS OWN FACEHAD HE KNOWN IT BUT THE FACE AND NECK OFRUE WERE SURGING IN THE COLOUR THAT DYED THE BLOSSOMING ROSETREE THERE ONTHE HEARTH BESIDE HER. IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM TO SPEAK. SHE SEEMED NOT TOEXPECT IT. HIS MIND WAS STRUGGLING WITH THE IMPRESSIONS OF THE ROOM. THEWHITENESS THE EXTREME PURITY OF EVERYTHING OCCUPIED HIMBEGAN TO TROUBLEHIM. AS HIS EYE BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE LIGHT OTHER OBJECTS GREW FROMTHE SURROUNDINGS AND TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE CIRCLE OF LAMPLIGHT. THEREWAS A PIANO AND A COALSCUTTLE AND A LITTLE IRON TRUNK AND A BATHTUB.THEN THERE WAS A ROW OF WOODEN PEGS AGAINST THE DOOR WITH A WHITE CHINTZCURTAIN COVERING THE CLOTHES UNDERNEATH. ON THE BED LAY AN UMBRELLA AND ABIG STRAW HAT AND ON THE TABLE A MUSICROLL UNFURLED AN INKSTAND ANDSHEETS OF RULED PAPER. BEHIND HIM STOOD A WARDROBE FACED WITH A MIRRORBUT SOMEHOW HE DID NOT CARE TO SEE HIS OWN FACE JUST THEN. HE WASSOBERING.THE GIRL SAT LOOKING AT HIM WITHOUT A WORD. HER FACE WAS EXPRESSIONLESSYET THE LIPS AT TIMES TREMBLED ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY. HER EYES SOWONDERFULLY BLUE IN THE DAYLIGHT SEEMED DARK AND SOFT AS VELVET AND THECOLOUR ON HER NECK DEEPENED AND WHITENED WITH EVERY BREATH. SHE SEEMEDSMALLER AND MORE SLENDER THAN WHEN HE HAD SEEN HER IN THE STREET ANDTHERE WAS NOW SOMETHING IN THE CURVE OF HER CHEEK ALMOST INFANTINE. WHENAT LAST HE TURNED AND CAUGHT HIS OWN REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR BEHIND HIMA SHOCK PASSED THROUGH HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD SEEN A SHAMEFUL THING AND HISCLOUDED MIND AND HIS CLOUDED THOUGHTS GREW CLEARER. FOR A MOMENT THEIREYES MET THEN HIS SOUGHT THE FLOOR HIS LIPS TIGHTENED AND THE STRUGGLEWITHIN HIM BOWED HIS HEAD AND STRAINED EVERY NERVE TO THE BREAKING. ANDNOW IT WAS OVER FOR THE VOICE WITHIN HAD SPOKEN. HE LISTENED DULLYINTERESTED BUT ALREADY KNOWING THE ENDINDEED IT LITTLE MATTEREDTHEEND WOULD ALWAYS BE THE SAME FOR HIMHE UNDERSTOOD NOWALWAYS THE SAMEFOR HIM AND HE LISTENED DULLY INTERESTED TO A VOICE WHICH GREW WITHINHIM. AFTER A WHILE HE STOOD UP AND SHE ROSE AT ONCE ONE SMALL HANDRESTING ON THE TABLE. PRESENTLY HE OPENED THE WINDOW PICKED UP HIS HATAND SHUT IT AGAIN. THEN HE WENT OVER TO THE ROSEBUSH AND TOUCHED THEBLOSSOMS WITH HIS FACE. ONE WAS STANDING IN A GLASS OF WATER ON THE TABLEAND MECHANICALLY THE GIRL DREW IT OUT PRESSED IT WITH HER LIPS AND LAIDIT ON THE TABLE BESIDE HIM. HE TOOK IT WITHOUT A WORD AND CROSSING THEROOM OPENED THE DOOR. THE LANDING WAS DARK AND SILENT BUT THE GIRLLIFTED THE LAMP AND GLIDING PAST HIM SLIPPED DOWN THE POLISHED STAIRS TOTHE HALLWAY. THEN UNCHAINING THE BOLTS SHE DREW OPEN THE IRON WICKET.THROUGH THIS HE PASSED WITH HIS ROSE.\n",

EXTENSIVE RESEARCH DID NOT UNCOVER ANY EVIDENCE THAT         THE U.S. COPYRIGHT ON THIS PUBLICATION WAS RENEWED.DURING THE WINTER OF  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS MADE ASTRANGE AND SECRET INVESTIGATION OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS IN THE ANCIENTMASSACHUSETTS SEAPORT OF INNSMOUTH. THE PUBLIC FIRST LEARNED OF IT INFEBRUARY WHEN A VAST SERIES OF RAIDS AND ARRESTS OCCURRED FOLLOWED BYTHE DELIBERATE BURNING AND DYNAMITINGUNDER SUITABLE PRECAUTIONSOFAN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF CRUMBLING WORMEATEN AND SUPPOSEDLY EMPTYHOUSES ALONG THE ABANDONED WATERFRONT. UNINQUIRING SOULS LET THISOCCURRENCE PASS AS ONE OF THE MAJOR CLASHES IN A SPASMODIC WAR ONLIQUOR.KEENER NEWSFOLLOWERS HOWEVER WONDERED AT THE PRODIGIOUS NUMBER OFARRESTS THE ABNORMALLY LARGE FORCE OF MEN USED IN MAKING THEM ANDTHE SECRECY SURROUNDING THE DISPOSAL OF THE PRISONERS. NO TRIALS OREVEN DEFINITE CHARGES WERE REPORTED NOR WERE ANY OF THE CAPTIVESSEEN THEREAFTER IN THE REGULAR JAILS OF THE NATION. THERE WERE VAGUESTATEMENTS ABOUT DISEASE AND CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND LATER ABOUTDISPERSAL IN VARIOUS NAVAL AND MILITARY PRISONS BUT NOTHING POSITIVEEVER DEVELOPED.COMPLAINTS FROM MANY LIBERAL ORGANIZATIONS WERE MET WITH LONGCONFIDENTIAL DISCUSSIONS AND REPRESENTATIVES WERE TAKEN ON TRIPSTO CERTAIN CAMPS AND PRISONS. AS A RESULT THESE SOCIETIES BECAMESURPRISINGLY PASSIVE AND RETICENT. NEWSPAPER MEN WERE HARDER TOMANAGE BUT SEEMED LARGELY TO COOPERATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN THEEND. ONLY ONE PAPERA TABLOID ALWAYS DISCOUNTED BECAUSE OF ITSWILD POLICYMENTIONED THE DEEPDIVING SUBMARINE THAT DISCHARGEDTORPEDOES DOWNWARD IN THE MARINE ABYSS JUST BEYOND DEVIL REEF. THATITEM GATHERED BY CHANCE IN A HAUNT OF SAILORS SEEMED INDEED RATHERFARFETCHED SINCE THE LOW BLACK REEF LIES A FULL MILE AND A HALF OUTFROM INNSMOUTH HARBOR.BUT AT LAST I AM GOING TO DEFY THE BAN ON SPEECH ABOUT THIS THING.RESULTS I AM CERTAIN ARE SO THOROUGH THAT NO PUBLIC HARM SAVE A SHOCKOF REPULSION COULD EVER ACCRUE FROM A HINTING OF WHAT WAS FOUND BYTHOSE HORRIFIED RAIDERS AT INNSMOUTH. FOR MY CONTACT WITH THIS AFFAIRHAS BEEN CLOSER THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER LAYMAN AND I HAVE CARRIED AWAYIMPRESSIONS WHICH ARE YET TO DRIVE ME TO DRASTIC MEASURES.IT WAS I WHO FLED FRANTICALLY OUT OF INNSMOUTH IN THE EARLY MORNINGHOURS OF JULY   AND WHOSE FRIGHTENED APPEALS FOR GOVERNMENTINQUIRY AND ACTION BROUGHT ON THE WHOLE REPORTED EPISODE. I WAS WILLINGENOUGH TO STAY MUTE WHILE THE AFFAIR WAS FRESH AND UNCERTAIN BUT NOWTHAT IT IS AN OLD STORY WITH PUBLIC INTEREST AND CURIOSITY GONE IHAVE AN ODD CRAVING TO WHISPER ABOUT THOSE FEW FRIGHTFUL HOURS INTHAT ILLRUMORED AND EVILLYSHADOWED SEAPORT OF DEATH AND BLASPHEMOUSABNORMALITY.I NEVER HEARD OF INNSMOUTH TILL THE DAY BEFORE I SAW IT FOR THE FIRSTANDSO FARLAST TIME. I WAS CELEBRATING MY COMING OF AGE BY A TOUROF NEW ENGLANDSIGHTSEEING ANTIQUARIAN AND GENEALOGICALAND HADPLANNED TO GO DIRECTLY FROM ANCIENT NEWBURYPORT TO ARKHAM WHENCE MYMOTHERS FAMILY WAS DERIVED. I HAD NO CAR BUT WAS TRAVELING BY TRAINTROLLEY AND MOTORCOACH ALWAYS SEEKING THE CHEAPEST POSSIBLE ROUTE.IN NEWBURYPORT THEY TOLD ME THAT THE STEAM TRAIN WAS THE THING TOTAKE TO ARKHAM AND IT WAS ONLY AT THE STATION TICKETOFFICE WHEN IDEMURRED AT THE HIGH FARE THAT I LEARNED ABOUT INNSMOUTH. THE STOUTSHREWDFACED AGENT WHOSE SPEECH SHOWED HIM TO BE NO LOCAL MAN SEEMEDSYMPATHETIC TOWARD MY EFFORTS AT ECONOMY AND MADE A SUGGESTION THATNONE OF MY OTHER INFORMANTS HAD OFFERED.YOU COULD TAKE THAT OLD BUS I SUPPOSE HE SAID WITH A CERTAINHESITATION BUT IT AINT THOUGHT MUCH OF HEREABOUTS. IT GOES THROUGHINNSMOUTHYOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT THATAND SO THE PEOPLE DONTLIKE IT. RUN BY AN INNSMOUTH FELLOWJOE SARGENTBUT NEVER GETS ANYCUSTOM FROM HERE OR ARKHAM EITHER I GUESS. LEAVES THE SQUAREFRONTOF HAMMONDS DRUG STOREAT  A.M. AND  P.M. UNLESS THEYVE CHANGEDLATELY. LOOKS LIKE A TERRIBLE RATTLETRAPIVE NEVER BEEN ON IT.THAT WAS THE FIRST I EVER HEARD OF SHADOWED INNSMOUTH. ANY REFERENCETO A TOWN NOT SHOWN ON COMMON MAPS OR LISTED IN RECENT GUIDEBOOKSWOULD HAVE INTERESTED ME AND THE AGENTS OLD MANNER OF ALLUSIONROUSED SOMETHING LIKE REAL CURIOSITY. SO I ASKED THE AGENT TO TELL MESOMETHING ABOUT IT.HE WAS VERY DELIBERATE AND SPOKE WITH AN AIR OF FEELING SLIGHTLYSUPERIOR TO WHAT HE SAID.INNSMOUTH WELL ITS A QUEER KIND OF TOWN DOWN AT THE MOUTH OFTHE MANUXET. USED TO BE ALMOST A CITYQUITE A PORT BEFORE THE WAROF BUT ALL GONE TO PIECES IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS OR SO. NORAILROAD NOWB.  M. NEVER WENT THROUGH AND THE BRANCH LINE FROMROWLEY WAS GIVEN UP YEARS AGO.MORE EMPTY HOUSES THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE I GUESS AND NO BUSINESS TOSPEAK OF EXCEPT FISHING AND LOBSTERING. EVERYBODY TRADES MOSTLY EITHERHERE OR IN ARKHAM OR IPSWICH. ONCE THEY HAD QUITE A FEW MILLS BUTNOTHINGS LEFT NOW EXCEPT ONE GOLD REFINERY RUNNING ON THE LEANEST KINDOF PART TIME.THAT REFINERY THOUGH USED TO BE A BIG THING AND OLD MAN MARSHWHO OWNS IT MUST BE RICHERN CROESUS. QUEER OLD DUCK THOUGH ANDSTICKS MIGHTY CLOSE IN HIS HOME. HES SUPPOSED TO HAVE DEVELOPEDSOME SKIN DISEASE OR DEFORMITY LATE IN LIFE THAT MAKES HIM KEEP OUTOF SIGHT. GRANDSON OF CAPTAIN OBED MARSH WHO FOUNDED THE BUSINESS.HIS MOTHER SEEMS TOVE BEEN SOME KIND OF FOREIGNERTHEY SAY A SOUTHSEA ISLANDERSO EVERYBODY RAISED CAIN WHEN HE MARRIED AN IPSWICHGIRL FIFTY YEARS AGO. THEY ALWAYS DO THAT ABOUT INNSMOUTH PEOPLE ANDFOLKS HERE AND HEREABOUTS ALWAYS TRY TO COVER UP ANY INNSMOUTH BLOODTHEY HAVE IN EM. BUT MARSHS CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN LOOK JUSTLIKE ANYBODY ELSE SO FARS I CAN SEE. IVE HAD EM POINTED OUT TO MEHERETHOUGH COME TO THINK OF IT THE ELDER CHILDREN DONT SEEM TO BEAROUND LATELY. NEVER SAW THE OLD MAN.AND WHY IS EVERYBODY SO DOWN ON INNSMOUTH WELL YOUNG FELLOW YOUMUSTNT TAKE TOO MUCH STOCK IN WHAT PEOPLE AROUND HERE SAY. THEYREHARD TO GET STARTED BUT ONCE THEY DO GET STARTED THEY NEVER LETUP. THEYVE BEEN TELLING THINGS ABOUT INNSMOUTHWHISPERING EMMOSTLYFOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS I GUESS AND I GATHER THEYREMORE SCARED THAN ANYTHING ELSE. SOME OF THE STORIES WOULD MAKE YOULAUGHABOUT OLD CAPTAIN MARSH DRIVING BARGAINS WITH THE DEVIL ANDBRINGING IMPS OUT OF HELL TO LIVE IN INNSMOUTH OR ABOUT SOME KIND OFDEVILWORSHIP AND AWFUL SACRIFICES IN SOME PLACE NEAR THE WHARVES THATPEOPLE STUMBLED ON AROUND  OR THEREABOUTSBUT I COME FROM PANTONVERMONT AND THAT KIND OF STORY DONT GO DOWN WITH ME.YOU OUGHT TO HEAR THOUGH WHAT SOME OF THE OLDTIMERS TELL ABOUTTHE BLACK REEF OFF THE COASTDEVIL REEF THEY CALL IT. ITS WELLABOVE WATER A GOOD PART OF THE TIME AND NEVER MUCH BELOW IT BUT ATTHAT YOU COULD HARDLY CALL IT AN ISLAND. THE STORY IS THAT THERES AWHOLE LEGION OF DEVILS SEEN SOMETIMES ON THAT REEFSPRAWLED ABOUTOR DARTING IN AND OUT OF SOME KIND OF CAVES NEAR THE TOP. ITS ARUGGED UNEVEN THING A GOOD BIT OVER A MILE OUT AND TOWARD THE END OFSHIPPING DAYS SAILORS USED TO MAKE BIG DETOURS JUST TO AVOID IT.THAT IS SAILORS THAT DIDNT HAIL FROM INNSMOUTH. ONE OF THE THINGSTHEY HAD AGAINST OLD CAPTAIN MARSH WAS THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO LAND ONIT SOMETIMES AT NIGHT WHEN THE TIDE WAS RIGHT. MAYBE HE DID FOR I DARESAY THE ROCK FORMATION WAS INTERESTING AND ITS JUST BARELY POSSIBLEHE WAS LOOKING FOR PIRATE LOOT AND MAYBE FINDING IT BUT THERE WAS TALKOF HIS DEALING WITH DEMONS THERE. FACT IS I GUESS ON THE WHOLE IT WASREALLY THE CAPTAIN THAT GAVE THE BAD REPUTATION TO THE REEF.THAT WAS BEFORE THE BIG EPIDEMIC OF  WHEN OVER HALF THE FOLKSIN INNSMOUTH WAS CARRIED OFF. THEY NEVER DID QUITE FIGURE OUT WHATTHE TROUBLE WAS BUT IT WAS PROBABLY SOME FOREIGN KIND OF DISEASEBROUGHT FROM CHINA OR SOMEWHERE BY THE SHIPPING. IT SURELY WAS BADENOUGHTHERE WAS RIOTS OVER IT AND ALL SORTS OF GHASTLY DOINGS THAT IDONT BELIEVE EVER GOT OUTSIDE OF TOWNAND IT LEFT THE PLACE IN AWFULSHAPE. NEVER CAME BACKTHERE CANT BE MOREN  OR  PEOPLE LIVINGTHERE NOW.BUT THE REAL THING BEHIND THE WAY FOLKS FEEL IS SIMPLY RACEPREJUDICEAND I DONT SAY IM BLAMING THOSE THAT HOLD IT. I HATETHOSE INNSMOUTH FOLKS MYSELF AND I WOULDNT CARE TO GO TO THEIRTOWN. I SPOSE YOU KNOWTHOUGH I CAN SEE YOURE A WESTERNER BY YOURTALKWHAT A LOT OUR NEW ENGLAND SHIPS USED TO HAVE TO DO WITH QUEERPORTS IN AFRICA ASIA THE SOUTH SEAS AND EVERYWHERE ELSE AND WHATQUEER KINDS OF PEOPLE THEY SOMETIMES BROUGHT BACK WITH EM. YOUVEPROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE SALEM MAN THAT CAME HOME WITH A CHINESE WIFEAND MAYBE YOU KNOW THERES STILL A BUNCH OF FIJI ISLANDERS SOMEWHEREAROUND CAPE COD.WELL THERE MUST BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT BACK OF THE INNSMOUTH PEOPLE.THE PLACE ALWAYS WAS BADLY CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY BYMARSHES AND CREEKS AND WE CANT BE SURE ABOUT THE INS AND OUTS OFTHE MATTER BUT ITS PRETTY CLEAR THAT OLD CAPTAIN MARSH MUST HAVEBROUGHT HOME SOME ODD SPECIMENS WHEN HE HAD ALL THREE OF HIS SHIPS INCOMMISSION BACK IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES. THERE CERTAINLY IS ASTRANGE KIND OF A STREAK IN THE INNSMOUTH FOLKS TODAYI DONT KNOW HOWTO EXPLAIN IT BUT IT SORT OF MAKES YOU CRAWL. YOULL NOTICE A LITTLEIN SARGENT IF YOU TAKE HIS BUS. SOME OF EM HAVE QUEER NARROW HEADSWITH FLAT NOSES AND BULGY STAREY EYES THAT NEVER SEEM TO SHUT ANDTHEIR SKIN AINT QUITE RIGHT. ROUGH AND SCABBY AND THE SIDES OF THEIRNECKS ARE ALL SHRIVELED OR CREASED UP. GET BALD TOO VERY YOUNG. THEOLDER FELLOWS LOOK THE WORSTFACT IS I DONT BELIEVE IVE EVER SEENA VERY OLD CHAP OF THAT KIND. GUESS THEY MUST DIE OF LOOKING IN THEGLASS ANIMALS HATE EMTHEY USED TO HAVE LOTS OF HORSE TROUBLE BEFOREAUTOS CAME IN.NOBODY CAN EVER KEEP TRACK OF THOSE PEOPLE AND STATE SCHOOL OFFICIALSAND CENSUS MEN HAVE A DEVIL OF A TIME. YOU CAN BET THAT PRYINGSTRANGERS AINT WELCOME AROUND INNSMOUTH. IVE HEARD PERSONALLY OFMOREN ONE BUSINESS OR GOVERNMENT MAN THATS DISAPPEARED THERE ANDTHERES LOOSE TALK OF ONE WHO WENT CRAZY AND IS OUT AT DANVERS NOW.THEY MUST HAVE FIXED UP SOME AWFUL SCARE FOR THAT FELLOW.THATS WHY I WOULDNT GO AT NIGHT IF I WAS YOU. IVE NEVER BEEN THEREAND HAVE NO WISH TO GO BUT I GUESS A DAYTIME TRIP COULDNT HURTYOUEVEN THOUGH THE PEOPLE HEREABOUTS WILL ADVISE YOU NOT TO MAKE IT.IF YOURE JUST SIGHTSEEING AND LOOKING FOR OLDTIME STUFF INNSMOUTHOUGHT TO BE QUITE A PLACE FOR YOU.AND SO I SPENT PART OF THAT EVENING AT THE NEWBURYPORT PUBLIC LIBRARYLOOKING UP DATA ABOUT INNSMOUTH. THE ESSEX COUNTY HISTORIES ON THELIBRARY SHELVES HAD VERY LITTLE TO SAY EXCEPT THAT THE TOWN WASFOUNDED IN  NOTED FOR SHIPBUILDING BEFORE THE REVOLUTION A SEATOF GREAT MARINE PROSPERITY IN THE EARLY TH CENTURY AND LATER A MINORFACTORY CENTER USING THE MANUXET AS POWER. THE EPIDEMIC AND RIOTS OF WERE VERY SPARSELY TREATED AS IF THEY FORMED A DISCREDIT TO THECOUNTRY.REFERENCES TO DECLINE WERE FEW THOUGH THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LATERRECORD WAS UNMISTAKABLE. AFTER THE CIVIL WAR ALL INDUSTRIAL LIFE WASCONFINED TO THE MARSH REFINING COMPANY AND THE MARKETING OF GOLDINGOTS FORMED THE ONLY REMAINING BIT OF MAJOR COMMERCE ASIDE FROM THEETERNAL FISHING.MOST INTERESTING OF ALL WAS A GLANCING REFERENCE TO THE STRANGE JEWELRYVAGUELY ASSOCIATED WITH INNSMOUTH. IT HAD EVIDENTLY IMPRESSED THE WHOLECOUNTRYSIDE MORE THAN A LITTLE FOR MENTION WAS MADE OF SPECIMENS INTHE MUSEUM OF MISKATONIC UNIVERSITY AT ARKHAM AND IN THE DISPLAY ROOMOF THE NEWBURYPORT HISTORICAL SOCIETY. I RESOLVED TO SEE THE LOCALSAMPLESAID TO BE A LARGE QUEERLYPROPORTIONED THING EVIDENTLY MEANTFOR A TIARAIF IT COULD POSSIBLY BE ARRANGED.THE LIBRARIAN GAVE ME A NOTE OF INTRODUCTION TO THE CURATOR OF THESOCIETY A MISS ANNA TILTON WHO LIVED NEARBY AND AFTER A BRIEFEXPLANATION THAT ANCIENT GENTLEWOMAN WAS KIND ENOUGH TO PILOT ME INTOTHE CLOSED BUILDING SINCE THE HOUR WAS NOT OUTRAGEOUSLY LATE. THECOLLECTION WAS A NOTABLE ONE INDEED BUT IN MY PRESENT MOOD I HAD EYESFOR NOTHING BUT THE BIZARRE OBJECT WHICH GLISTENED IN A CORNER CUPBOARDUNDER THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS.IT TOOK NO EXCESSIVE SENSITIVENESS TO BEAUTY TO MAKE ME LITERALLY GASPAT THE STRANGE UNEARTHLY SPLENDOR OF THE ALIEN OPULENT PHANTASY THATRESTED THERE ON A PURPLE VELVET CUSHION. THE LONGER I LOOKED THE MORETHE THING FASCINATED ME AND IN THIS FASCINATION THERE WAS A CURIOUSLYDISTURBING ELEMENT HARDLY TO BE CLASSIFIED OR ACCOUNTED FOR. I DECIDEDTHAT IT WAS THE QUEER OTHERWORLDLY QUALITY OF THE ART WHICH MADE MEUNEASY. IT WAS AS IF THE WORKMANSHIP WERE THAT OF ANOTHER PLANET.THE PATTERNS ALL HINTED OF REMOTE SECRETS AND UNIMAGINABLE ABYSSES INTIME AND SPACE AND THE MONOTONOUSLY AQUATIC NATURE OF THE RELIEFSBECAME ALMOST SINISTER. AMONG THESE RELIEFS WERE FABULOUS MONSTERS OFABHORRENT GROTESQUENESS AND MALIGNITYWHOLLY PRIMAL AND AWESOMELYANCESTRAL.AT TIMES I FANCIED THAT EVERY CONTOUR OF THESE BLASPHEMOUS FISHFROGSWAS OVERFLOWING WITH THE ULTIMATE QUINTESSENCE OF UNKNOWN AND INHUMANEVIL.IN ODD CONTRAST TO THE TIARAS ASPECT WAS ITS BRIEF AND PROSY HISTORYAS RELATED BY MISS TILTON. IT HAD BEEN PAWNED FOR A RIDICULOUS SUM ATA SHOP IN STATE STREET IN  BY A DRUNKEN INNSMOUTH MAN SHORTLYAFTERWARD KILLED IN A BRAWL.MISS TILTON WAS INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT IT FORMED PART OF SOME EXOTICPIRATE HOARD DISCOVERED BY OLD CAPTAIN OBED MARSH. THIS VIEW WAS SURELYNOT WEAKENED BY THE INSISTENT OFFERS OF PURCHASE AT A HIGH PRICEWHICH THE MARSHES BEGAN TO MAKE AS SOON AS THEY KNEW OF ITS PRESENCEAND WHICH THEY REPEATED TO THIS DAY DESPITE THE SOCIETYS UNVARYINGDETERMINATION NOT TO SELL.AS THE GOOD LADY SHOWED ME OUT OF THE BUILDING SHE ASSURED ME THAT THERUMORS OF DEVILWORSHIP WERE PARTLY JUSTIFIED BY A PECULIAR SECRET CULTWHICH HAD GAINED FORCE THERE AND ENGULFED ALL THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES.IT WAS CALLED SHE SAID THE ESOTERIC ORDER OF DAGON AND WASUNDOUBTEDLY A DEBASED QUASIPAGAN THING IMPORTED FROM THE EAST ACENTURY BEFORE AT A TIME WHEN INNSMOUTH FISHERIES SEEMED TO BE GOINGBARREN. ITS PERSISTENCE AMONG A SIMPLE PEOPLE WAS QUITE NATURAL IN VIEWOF THE SUDDEN AND PERMANENT RETURN OF ABUNDANTLY FINE FISHING AND ITSOON CAME TO BE THE GREATEST INFLUENCE ON THE TOWN.ALL THIS TO THE PIOUS MISS TILTON FORMED AN EXCELLENT REASON FORSHUNNING THE ANCIENT TOWN OF DECAY AND DESOLATION BUT TO ME IT WASMERELY A FRESH INCENTIVE AND I COULD SCARCELY SLEEP IN MY SMALL ROOMAT THE Y AS THE NIGHT WORE AWAY.                                  IISHORTLY BEFORE TEN THE NEXT MORNING I STOOD WITH MY ONE SMALL VALISEIN FRONT OF HAMMONDS DRUG STORE IN OLD MARKET SQUARE WAITING FORTHE INNSMOUTH BUS. IN A FEW MOMENTS A SMALL MOTORCOACH OF EXTREMEDECREPITUDE AND DIRTY GRAY COLOR RATTLED DOWN STATE STREET MADE ATURN AND DREW UP AT THE CURB BESIDE ME. I FELT IMMEDIATELY THATIT WAS THE RIGHT ONE A GUESS WHICH THE HALFILLEGIBLE SIGN ON THEWINDSHIELDARKHAMINNSMOUTHNEWBPORTSOON VERIFIED.THERE WERE ONLY THREE PASSENGERSDARK UNKEMPT MEN OF SULLEN VISAGEAND SOMEWHAT YOUTHFUL CASTAND WHEN THE VEHICLE STOPPED THEY CLUMSILYSHAMBLED OUT AND BEGAN WALKING UP STATE STREET IN A SILENT ALMOSTFURTIVE FASHION. THE DRIVER ALSO ALIGHTED. THIS I REFLECTED MUST BETHE JOE SARGENT MENTIONED BY THE TICKETAGENT AND EVEN BEFORE I HADNOTICED ANY DETAILS THERE SPREAD OVER ME A WAVE OF SPONTANEOUS AVERSIONWHICH COULD BE NEITHER CHECKED NOR EXPLAINED.HE WAS A THIN STOOPSHOULDERED MAN NOT MUCH UNDER SIX FEET TALLDRESSED IN SHABBY BLUE CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND WEARING A FRAYED GRAY GOLFCAP. HIS AGE WAS PERHAPS THIRTYFIVE BUT THE ODD DEEP CREASES IN THESIDES OF HIS NECK MADE HIM SEEM OLDER WHEN ONE DID NOT STUDY HIS DULLEXPRESSIONLESS FACE. HE HAD A NARROW HEAD BULGING WATERY BLUE EYESTHAT SEEMED NEVER TO WINK A FLAT NOSE A RECEDING FOREHEAD AND CHINAND SINGULARLY UNDEVELOPED EARS. AS HE WALKED TOWARD THE BUS I OBSERVEDHIS PECULIARLY SHAMBLING GAIT AND SAW THAT HIS FEET WERE INORDINATELYIMMENSE. THE MORE I STUDIED THEM THE MORE I WONDERED HOW HE COULD BUYANY SHOES TO FIT THEM.A CERTAIN GREASINESS ABOUT THE FELLOW INCREASED MY DISLIKE. HE WASEVIDENTLY GIVEN TO WORKING OR LOUNGING AROUND THE FISH DOCKS ANDCARRIED WITH HIM MUCH OF THEIR CHARACTERISTIC SMELL. JUST WHAT FOREIGNBLOOD WAS IN HIM I COULD NOT EVEN GUESS.I WAS SORRY WHEN I SAW THAT THERE WOULD BE NO OTHER PASSENGERS ON THEBUS. SOMEHOW I DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF RIDING ALONE WITH THIS DRIVER.BUT AS THE LEAVING TIME OBVIOUSLY APPROACHED I CONQUERED MY QUALMS ANDFOLLOWED THE MAN ABOARD EXTENDING HIM A DOLLAR BILL AND MURMURING THESINGLE WORD INNSMOUTH.AT LENGTH THE DECREPIT VEHICLE STARTED WITH A JERK AND RATTLED NOISILYPAST THE OLD BRICK BUILDINGS OF STATE STREET AMIDST A CLOUD OF VAPORFROM THE EXHAUST.THE DAY WAS WARM AND SUNNY BUT THE LANDSCAPE OF SAND SEDGEGRASSAND STUNTED SHRUBBERY BECAME MORE AND MORE DESOLATE AS WE PROCEEDED.OUT THE WINDOW I COULD SEE THE BLUE WATER AND THE SANDY LINE OF PLUMISLAND AND WE PRESENTLY DREW VERY NEAR THE BEACH AS OUR NARROW ROADVEERED OFF FROM THE MAIN HIGHWAY TO ROWLEY AND IPSWICH.AT LAST WE LOST SIGHT OF PLUM ISLAND AND SAW THE VAST EXPANSE OF THEOPEN ATLANTIC ON OUR LEFT. OUR NARROW COURSE BEGAN TO CLIMB STEEPLYAND I FELT A SINGULAR SENSE OF DISQUIET IN LOOKING AT THE LONELY CRESTAHEAD WHERE THE RUTTED ROADWAY MET THE SKY. IT WAS AS IF THE BUS WEREABOUT TO KEEP ON ITS ASCENT LEAVING THE SANE EARTH ALTOGETHER ANDMERGING WITH THE UNKNOWN ARCANA OF UPPER AIR AND CRYPTICAL SKY. THESMELL OF THE SEA TOOK ON OMINOUS IMPLICATIONS AND THE SILENT DRIVERSBENT RIGID BACK AND NARROW HEAD BECAME MORE AND MORE HATEFUL. AS ILOOKED AT HIM I SAW THAT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD WAS ALMOST AS HAIRLESSAS HIS FACE HAVING ONLY A FEW STRAGGLING YELLOW STRANDS UPON A GRAYSCABROUS SURFACE.THEN WE REACHED THE CREST AND BEHELD THE OUTSPREAD VALLEY BEYONDWHERE THE MANUXET JOINS THE SEA JUST NORTH OF THE LONG LINE OF CLIFFSTHAT CULMINATE IN KINGSPORT HEAD ALL MY ATTENTION WAS CAPTURED BY THENEARER PANORAMA JUST BELOW ME. I HAD I REALIZED COME FACE TO FACEWITH RUMORSHADOWED INNSMOUTH.IT WAS A TOWN OF WIDE EXTENT AND DENSE CONSTRUCTION YET ONE WITH APORTENTOUS DEARTH OF VISIBLE LIFE. THE VAST HUDDLE OF SAGGING GAMBRELROOFS AND PEAKED GABLES CONVEYED WITH OFFENSIVE CLEARNESS THE IDEAOF WORMY DECAY AND AS WE APPROACHED ALONG THE NOW DESCENDING ROAD ICOULD SEE THAT MANY ROOFS HAD WHOLLY CAVED IN. STRETCHING INLAND I SAWTHE RUSTED GRASSGROWN LINE OF THE ABANDONED RAILWAY WITH LEANINGTELEGRAPHPOLES NOW DEVOID OF WIRES.HERE AND THERE THE RUINS OF WHARVES JUTTED OUT FROM THE SHORE TO ENDIN INDETERMINATE ROTTENNESS THOSE FARTHEST SOUTH SEEMING THE MOSTDECAYED. AND FAR OUT AT SEA DESPITE A HIGH TIDE I GLIMPSED A LONGBLACK LINE SCARCELY RISING ABOVE THE WATER YET CARRYING A SUGGESTION OFODD LATENT MALIGNANCY. THIS I KNEW MUST BE DEVIL REEF. AS I LOOKEDA SUBTLE CURIOUS SENSE OF BECKONING SEEMED SUPERADDED TO THE GRIMREPULSION AND ODDLY ENOUGH I FOUND THIS OVERTONE MORE DISTURBING THANTHE PRIMARY IMPRESSION.AS THE BUS REACHED A LOWER LEVEL I BEGAN TO CATCH THE STEADY NOTE OFA WATERFALL THROUGH THE UNNATURAL STILLNESS. THE LEANING UNPAINTEDHOUSES GREW THICKER LINED BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD AND DISPLAYED MOREURBAN TENDENCIES THAN DID THOSE WE WERE LEAVING BEHIND. THE PANORAMAAHEAD HAD CONTRACTED TO A STREET SCENE AND IN SPOTS I COULD SEEWHERE A COBBLESTONE PAVEMENT AND STRETCHES OF BRICK SIDEWALK HADFORMERLY EXISTED. ALL THE HOUSES WERE APPARENTLY DESERTED AND THEREWERE OCCASIONAL GAPS WHERE TUMBLEDOWN CHIMNEYS AND CELLAR WALLS TOLDOF BUILDINGS THAT HAD COLLAPSED. PERVADING EVERYTHING WAS THE MOSTNAUSEOUS FISHY ODOR IMAGINABLE.AND I WAS NOT TO REACH MY DESTINATION WITHOUT ONE OTHER VERY STRONGIMPRESSION OF POIGNANTLY DISAGREEABLE QUALITY. THE BUS HAD COME TO ASORT OF OPEN CONCOURSE OR RADIAL POINT WITH CHURCHES ON TWO SIDES ANDTHE BEDRAGGLED REMAINS OF A CIRCULAR GREEN IN THE CENTER AND I WASLOOKING AT A LARGE PILLARED HALL ON THE RIGHTHAND JUNCTION AHEAD. THESTRUCTURES ONCE WHITE PAINT WAS NOW GRAY AND PEELING AND THE BLACKAND GOLD SIGN ON THE PEDIMENT WAS SO FADED THAT I COULD ONLY WITHDIFFICULTY MAKE OUT THE WORDS ESOTERIC ORDER OF DAGON.THE DOOR OF THE CHURCH BASEMENT WAS OPEN REVEALING A RECTANGLE OFBLACKNESS INSIDE. AND AS I LOOKED A CERTAIN OBJECT CROSSED OR SEEMEDTO CROSS THAT DARK RECTANGLE BURNING INTO MY BRAIN A MOMENTARYCONCEPTION OF NIGHTMARE WHICH WAS ALL THE MORE MADDENING BECAUSEANALYSIS COULD NOT SHOW A SINGLE NIGHTMARISH QUALITY IN IT.IT WAS A LIVING OBJECTTHE FIRST EXCEPT THE DRIVER THAT I HAD SEENSINCE ENTERING THE COMPACT PART OF THE TOWNAND HAD I BEEN IN ASTEADIER MOOD I WOULD HAVE FOUND NOTHING WHATEVER OF TERROR IN IT.CLEARLY AS I REALIZED A MOMENT LATER IT WAS THE PASTOR CLAD INSOME PECULIAR VESTMENTS DOUBTLESS INTRODUCED SINCE THE ORDER OF DAGONHAD MODIFIED THE RITUAL OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES. THE THING WHICH HADPROBABLY CAUGHT MY FIRST SUBCONSCIOUS GLANCE AND SUPPLIED THE TOUCH OFBIZARRE HORROR WAS THE TALL TIARA HE WORE AN ALMOST EXACT DUPLICATEOF THE ONE MISS TILTON HAD SHOWN ME THE PREVIOUS EVENING. THIS ACTINGON MY IMAGINATION HAD SUPPLIED NAMELESSLY SINISTER QUALITIES TO THEINDETERMINATE FACE AND ROBED SHAMBLING FORM BENEATH IT.A VERY THIN SPRINKLING OF REPELLENTLOOKING YOUNGISH PEOPLE NOW BECAMEVISIBLE ON THE SIDEWALKSLONE INDIVIDUALS AND SILENT KNOTS OF TWOOR THREE. THE LOWER FLOORS OF THE CRUMBLING HOUSES SOMETIMES HARBOREDSMALL SHOPS WITH DINGY SIGNS AND I NOTICED A PARKED TRUCK OR TWO AS WERATTLED ALONG. THE SOUND OF WATERFALLS BECAME MORE AND MORE DISTINCTAND PRESENTLY I SAW A FAIRLY DEEP RIVERGORGE AHEAD SPANNED BY A WIDEIRONRAILED HIGHWAY BRIDGE BEYOND WHICH A LARGE SQUARE OPENED OUT. THENWE ROLLED INTO THE LARGE SEMICIRCULAR SQUARE ACROSS THE RIVER AND DREWUP ON THE RIGHTHAND SIDE IN FRONT OF A TALL CUPOLACROWNED BUILDINGWITH REMNANTS OF YELLOW PAINT AND WITH A HALFEFFACED SIGN PROCLAIMINGIT TO BE THE GILMAN HOUSE.I WAS GLAD TO GET OUT OF THAT BUS AND AT ONCE PROCEEDED TO CHECKMY VALISE IN THE SHABBY HOTEL LOBBY. THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON INSIGHTAN ELDERLY MAN WITHOUT WHAT I HAD COME TO CALL THE INNSMOUTHLOOKAND I DECIDED NOT TO ASK HIM ANY OF THE QUESTIONS WHICH BOTHEREDME REMEMBERING THAT ODD THINGS HAD BEEN NOTICED IN THIS HOTEL.INSTEAD I STROLLED OUT ON THE SQUARE FROM WHICH THE BUS HAD ALREADYGONE AND STUDIED THE SCENE MINUTELY AND APPRAISINGLY.FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER I CHOSE TO MAKE MY FIRST INQUIRIES ATTHE CHAIN GROCERY WHOSE PERSONNEL WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE NATIVE TOINNSMOUTH. I FOUND A SOLITARY BOY OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN IN CHARGE AND WASPLEASED TO NOTE THE BRIGHTNESS AND AFFABILITY WHICH PROMISED CHEERFULINFORMATION. HE SEEMED EXCEPTIONALLY EAGER TO TALK AND I SOON GATHEREDTHAT HE DID NOT LIKE THE PLACE ITS FISHY SMELL OR ITS FURTIVE PEOPLE.HIS FAMILY DID NOT LIKE HIM TO WORK IN INNSMOUTH BUT THE CHAIN HADTRANSFERRED HIM THERE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO GIVE UP HIS JOB.THERE WAS HE SAID NO PUBLIC LIBRARY OR CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ININNSMOUTH BUT I COULD PROBABLY FIND MY WAY ABOUT. THE STREET I HADCOME DOWN WAS FEDERAL. WEST OF THAT WERE THE FINE OLD RESIDENCESTREETSBROAD WASHINGTON LAFAYETTE AND ADAMSAND EAST OF IT WERETHE SHOREWARD SLUMS.CERTAIN SPOTS WERE ALMOST FORBIDDEN TERRITORY AS HE HAD LEARNED ATCONSIDERABLE COST. ONE MUST NOT FOR EXAMPLE LINGER MUCH AROUND THEMARSH REFINERY OR AROUND ANY OF THE STILL USED CHURCHES OR AROUND THEPILLARED ORDER OF DAGON HALL AT NEW CHURCH GREEN. THOSE CHURCHES WEREVERY ODDALL VIOLENTLY DISAVOWED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE DENOMINATIONSELSEWHERE AND APPARENTLY USING THE QUEEREST KIND OF CEREMONIALS ANDCLERICAL VESTMENTS.AS FOR THE INNSMOUTH PEOPLETHE YOUTH HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO MAKE OFTHEM. THEIR APPEARANCEESPECIALLY THOSE STARING UNWINKING EYES WHICHONE NEVER SAW SHUTWAS CERTAINLY SHOCKING ENOUGHAND THEIR VOICESWERE DISGUSTING. IT WAS AWFUL TO HEAR THEM CHANTING IN THEIR CHURCHESAT NIGHT AND ESPECIALLY DURING THEIR MAIN FESTIVALS OR REVIVALS WHICHFELL TWICE A YEAR ON APRIL  AND OCTOBER .THEY WERE VERY FOND OF THE WATER AND SWAM A GREAT DEAL IN BOTH RIVERAND HARBOR. SWIMMING RACES OUT TO DEVIL REEF WERE VERY COMMON ANDEVERYONE IN SIGHT SEEMED WELL ABLE TO SHARE IN THIS ARDUOUS SPORT.IT WOULD BE OF NO USE MY INFORMANT SAID TO ASK THE NATIVES ANYTHINGABOUT THE PLACE. THE ONLY ONE WHO WOULD TALK WAS A VERY AGED BUTNORMALLOOKING MAN WHO LIVED AT THE POORHOUSE ON THE NORTH RIM OF THETOWN AND SPENT HIS TIME WALKING ABOUT OR LOUNGING AROUND THE FIRESTATION. THIS HOARY CHARACTER ZADOK ALLEN WAS  YEARS OLD ANDSOMEWHAT TOUCHED IN THE HEAD BESIDES BEING THE TOWN DRUNKARD. HE WAS ASTRANGE FURTIVE CREATURE WHO CONSTANTLY LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER ASIF AFRAID OF SOMETHING AND WHEN SOBER COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO TALKAT ALL WITH STRANGERS. HE WAS HOWEVER UNABLE TO RESIST ANY OFFER OFHIS FAVORITE POISON AND ONCE DRUNK WOULD FURNISH THE MOST ASTONISHINGFRAGMENTS OF WHISPERED REMINISCENCE.AFTER ALL THOUGH LITTLE USEFUL DATA COULD BE GAINED FROM HIM SINCEHIS STORIES WERE ALL INSANE INCOMPLETE HINTS OF IMPOSSIBLE MARVELS ANDHORRORS WHICH COULD HAVE NO SOURCE SAVE IN HIS OWN DISTORTED FANCY.NOBODY EVER BELIEVED HIM BUT THE NATIVES DID NOT LIKE HIM TO DRINKAND TALK WITH ANY STRANGERS AND IT WAS NOT ALWAYS SAFE TO BE SEENQUESTIONING HIM. IT WAS PROBABLY FROM HIM THAT SOME OF THE WILDESTPOPULAR WHISPERS AND DELUSIONS WERE DERIVED.THE MARSHES TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER THREE GENTLY BRED FAMILIES OF THETOWNTHE WAITES THE GILMANS AND THE ELIOTSWERE ALL VERY RETIRING.THEY LIVED IN IMMENSE HOUSES ALONG WASHINGTON STREET AND SEVERAL WEREREPUTED TO HARBOR IN CONCEALMENT CERTAIN KINSFOLK WHOSE PERSONAL ASPECTFORBADE PUBLIC VIEW AND WHOSE DEATHS HAD BEEN REPORTED AND RECORDED.WARNING ME THAT MOST OF THE STREET SIGNS WERE DOWN THE YOUTH DREW FORMY BENEFIT A ROUGH BUT AMPLE AND PAINSTAKING SKETCH MAP OF THE TOWNSSALIENT FEATURES. AFTER A MOMENTS STUDY I FELT SURE THAT IT WOULD BEOF GREAT HELP AND POCKETED IT WITH PROFUSE THANKS.THUS BEGAN MY SYSTEMATIC THOUGH HALFBEWILDERED TOUR OF INNSMOUTHSNARROW SHADOWBLIGHTED WAYS. CROSSING THE BRIDGE AND TURNING TOWARDTHE ROAR OF THE LOWER FALLS I PASSED CLOSE TO THE MARSH REFINERYWHICH SEEMED ODDLY FREE FROM THE NOISE OF INDUSTRY. THIS BUILDINGSTOOD ON THE STEEP RIVER BLUFF NEAR A BRIDGE AND AN OPEN CONFLUENCE OFSTREETS WHICH I TOOK TO BE THE EARLIEST CIVIC CENTER DISPLACED AFTERTHE REVOLUTION BY THE PRESENT TOWN SQUARE.RECROSSING THE GORGE ON THE MAIN STREET BRIDGE I STRUCK A REGION OFUTTER DESERTION WHICH SOMEHOW MADE ME SHUDDER. COLLAPSING HUDDLES OFGAMBREL ROOFS FORMED A JAGGED AND FANTASTIC SKYLINE ABOVE WHICH ROSETHE GHOULISH DECAPITATED STEEPLE OF AN ANCIENT CHURCH.FISH STREET WAS AS DESERTED AS MAIN THOUGH IT DIFFERED IN HAVING MANYBRICK AND STONE WAREHOUSES STILL IN EXCELLENT SHAPE. WATER STREETWAS ALMOST ITS DUPLICATE SAVE THAT THERE WERE GREAT SEAWARD GAPSWHERE WHARVES HAD BEEN. NOT A LIVING THING DID I SEE EXCEPT FOR THESCATTERED FISHERMEN ON THE DISTANT BREAKWATER AND NOT A SOUND DID IHEAR SAVE THE LAPPING OF THE HARBOR TIDES AND THE ROAR OF THE FALLS INTHE MANUXET.I KEPT NORTH ALONG MAIN TO MARTIN THEN TURNING INLAND CROSSINGFEDERAL STREET SAFELY NORTH OF THE GREEN AND ENTERING THE DECAYEDPATRICIAN NEIGHBORHOOD OF NORTHERN BROAD WASHINGTON LAFAYETTE ANDADAMS STREETS. FOLLOWING WASHINGTON STREET TOWARD THE RIVER I NOWFACED A ZONE OF FORMER INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE NOTING THE RUINS OF AFACTORY AHEAD AND SEEING OTHERS WITH THE TRACES OF AN OLD RAILWAYSTATION AND COVERED RAILWAY BRIDGE BEYOND UP THE GORGE ON MY RIGHT.THE UNCERTAIN BRIDGE NOW BEFORE ME WAS POSTED WITH A WARNING SIGNBUT I TOOK THE RISK AND CROSSED AGAIN TO THE SOUTH BANK WHERE TRACESOF LIFE REAPPEARED. FURTIVE SHAMBLING CREATURES STARED CRYPTICALLYIN MY DIRECTION AND MORE NORMAL FACES EYED ME COLDLY AND CURIOUSLY.INNSMOUTH WAS RAPIDLY BECOMING INTOLERABLE AND I TURNED DOWN PAINESTREET TOWARD THE SQUARE IN THE HOPE OF GETTING SOME VEHICLE TO TAKE METO ARKHAM BEFORE THE STILLDISTANT STARTING TIME OF THAT SINISTER BUS.IT WAS THEN THAT I SAW THE TUMBLEDOWN FIRE STATION ON MY LEFTAND NOTICED THE REDFACED BUSHYBEARDED WATERYEYED OLD MAN INNONDESCRIPT RAGS WHO SAT ON A BENCH IN FRONT OF IT TALKING WITH A PAIROF UNKEMPT BUT NOT ABNORMALLOOKING FIREMEN. THIS OF COURSE MUST BEZADOK ALLEN THE HALFCRAZED LIQUORISH NONAGENARIAN WHOSE TALES OFOLD INNSMOUTH AND ITS SHADOW WERE SO HIDEOUS AND INCREDIBLE.                                  IIII HAD BEEN ASSURED THAT THE OLD MAN COULD DO NOTHING BUT HINT AT WILDDISJOINTED AND INCREDIBLE LEGENDS AND I HAD BEEN WARNED THAT THENATIVES MADE IT UNSAFE TO BE SEEN TALKING WITH HIM YET THE THOUGHTOF THIS AGED WITNESS TO THE TOWNS DECAY WITH MEMORIES GOING BACK TOTHE EARLY DAYS OF SHIPS AND FACTORIES WAS A LURE THAT NO AMOUNTOF REASON COULD MAKE ME RESIST. CURIOSITY FLARED UP BEYOND SENSE ANDCAUTION AND IN MY YOUTHFUL EGOTISM I FANCIED I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SIFTA NUCLEUS OF REAL HISTORY FROM THE CONFUSED EXTRAVAGANT OUTPOURING IWOULD PROBABLY EXTRACT WITH THE AID OF WHISKEY.A QUART BOTTLE OF SUCH WAS EASILY THOUGH NOT CHEAPLY OBTAINED IN THEREAR OF A DINGY VARIETYSTORE JUST OFF THE SQUARE IN ELIOT STREET.REENTERING THE SQUARE I SAW THAT LUCK WAS WITH ME FORSHUFFLINGOUT OF PAINE STREET AROUND THE CORNER OF THE GILMAN HOUSEI GLIMPSEDNOTHING LESS THAN THE TALL LEAN TATTERED FORM OF OLD ZADOK ALLENHIMSELF. IN ACCORDANCE WITH MY PLAN I ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION BYBRANDISHING MY NEWLYPURCHASED BOTTLE AND SOON REALIZED THAT HE HADBEGUN TO SHUFFLE WISTFULLY AFTER ME AS I TURNED INTO WAITE STREET ON MYWAY TO THE MOST DESERTED REGION I COULD THINK OF. BEFORE I REACHED MAINSTREET I COULD HEAR A FAINT AND WHEEZY HEY MISTER BEHIND ME AND IPRESENTLY ALLOWED THE OLD MAN TO CATCH UP AND TAKE COPIOUS PULLS FROMTHE QUART BOTTLE.I BEGAN PUTTING OUT FEELERS AS WE WALKED ALONG TO WATER STREET ANDTURNED SOUTHWARD AMIDST THE OMNIPRESENT DESOLATION AND CRAZILY TILTEDRUINS BUT FOUND THAT THE AGED TONGUE DID NOT LOOSEN AS QUICKLYAS I HAD EXPECTED. AT LENGTH I SAW A GRASSGROWN OPENING TOWARDTHE SEA BETWEEN CRUMBLING BRICK WALLS WITH THE WEEDY LENGTH OF ANEARTHANDMASONRY WHARF PROJECTING BEYOND. PILES OF MOSSCOVERED STONESNEAR THE WATER PROMISED TOLERABLE SEATS AND THE SCENE WAS SHELTEREDFROM ALL POSSIBLE VIEW BY A RUINED WAREHOUSE ON THE NORTH.ABOUT FOUR HOURS REMAINED FOR CONVERSATION IF I WERE TO CATCH THE EIGHTOCLOCK COACH FOR ARKHAM AND I BEGAN TO DOLE OUT MORE LIQUOR TO THEANCIENT TIPPLER MEANWHILE EATING MY OWN FRUGAL LUNCH. IN MY DONATIONSI WAS CAREFUL NOT TO OVERSHOOT THE MARK FOR I DID NOT WISH ZADOKSVINOUS GARRULOUSNESS TO PASS INTO A STUPOR. AFTER AN HOUR HIS FURTIVETACITURNITY SHOWED SIGNS OF DISAPPEARING AND SOMETHING OR OTHER HADCAUSED HIS WANDERING GAZE TO LIGHT ON THE LOW DISTANT LINE OF DEVILREEF THEN SHOWING PLAINLY AND ALMOST FASCINATINGLY ABOVE THE WAVES. HEBENT TOWARD ME TOOK HOLD OF MY COAT LAPEL AND HISSED OUT SOME HINTSTHAT COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN.THARS WHAR IT ALL BEGUNTHAT CURSED PLACE OF ALL WICKEDNESS WHARTHE DEEP WATER STARTS.

EHAHHHHAH EYAAHHHH....THE HIDEOUS SUDDENNESS AND INHUMAN FRIGHTFULNESS OF THE OLD MANSSHRIEK ALMOST MADE ME FAINT. HIS EYES LOOKING PAST ME TOWARD THEMALODOROUS SEA WERE POSITIVELY STARTING FROM HIS HEAD WHILE HISFACE WAS A MASK OF FEAR WORTHY OF GREEK TRAGEDY. HIS BONY CLAW DUGMONSTROUSLY INTO MY SHOULDER AND HE MADE NO MOTION AS I TURNED MY HEADTO LOOK AT WHATEVER HE HAD GLIMPSED.THERE WAS NOTHING THAT I COULD SEE. ONLY THE INCOMING TIDE WITHPERHAPS ONE SET OF RIPPLES MORE LOCAL THAN THE LONGFLUNG LINE OFBREAKERS. BUT NOW ZADOK WAS SHAKING ME AND I TURNED BACK TO WATCH THEMELTING OF THAT FEARFROZEN FACE INTO A CHAOS OF TWITCHING EYELIDS ANDMUMBLING GUMS. PRESENTLY HIS VOICE CAME BACKALBEIT AS A TREMBLINGWHISPER.GIT AOUT O HERE GIT AOUT O HERE THEY SEEN USGIT AOUTFER YOUR LIFE DUNT WAIT FER NOTHINTHEY KNOW NAOWRUN FERITQUICKAOUT O THIS TAOWNANOTHER HEAVY WAVE DASHED AGAINST THE LOOSENING MASONRY OF THE BYGONEWHARF AND CHANGED THE MAD ANCIENTS WHISPER TO ANOTHER INHUMAN ANDBLOODCURDLING SCREAM.EYAAAHHHH...YHAAAAAAAA...BEFORE I COULD RECOVER MY SCATTERED WITS HE HAD RELAXED HIS CLUTCHON MY SHOULDER AND DASHED WILDLY INLAND TOWARD THE STREET REELINGNORTHWARD AROUND THE RUINED WAREHOUSE WALL.I GLANCED BACK AT THE SEA BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE. AND WHEN IREACHED WATER STREET AND LOOKED ALONG IT TOWARD THE NORTH THERE WAS NOREMAINING TRACE OF ZADOK ALLEN.                                  IVI CAN HARDLY DESCRIBE THE MOOD IN WHICH I WAS LEFT BY THIS HARROWINGEPISODEAN EPISODE AT ONCE MAD AND PITIFUL GROTESQUE AND TERRIFYING.THE GROCERY BOY HAD PREPARED ME FOR IT YET THE REALITY LEFT ME NONETHE LESS BEWILDERED AND DISTURBED. PUERILE THOUGH THE STORY WAS OLDZADOKS INSANE EARNESTNESS AND HORROR HAD COMMUNICATED TO ME A MOUNTINGUNREST WHICH JOINED WITH MY EARLIER SENSE OF LOATHING FOR THE TOWN ANDITS BLIGHT OF INTANGIBLE SHADOW.THE HOUR HAD GROWN PERILOUSLY LATEMY WATCH SAID  AND THE ARKHAMBUS LEFT TOWN SQUARE AT EIGHTSO I TRIED TO GIVE MY THOUGHTS ASNEUTRAL AND PRACTICAL A CAST AS POSSIBLE MEANWHILE WALKING RAPIDLYTHROUGH THE DESERTED STREETS OF GAPING ROOFS AND LEANING HOUSES TOWARDTHE HOTEL WHERE I HAD CHECKED MY VALISE AND WOULD FIND MY BUS.STUDYING THE GROCERY YOUTHS MAP AND SEEKING A ROUTE I HAD NOTTRAVERSED BEFORE I CHOSE MARSH STREET INSTEAD OF STATE FOR MY APPROACHTO TOWN SQUARE. NEAR THE CORNER OF FALL STREET I BEGAN TO SEE SCATTEREDGROUPS OF FURTIVE WHISPERERS AND WHEN I FINALLY REACHED THE SQUARE ISAW THAT ALMOST ALL THE LOITERERS WERE CONGREGATED AROUND THE DOOR OFTHE GILMAN HOUSE. IT SEEMED AS IF MANY BULGING WATERY UNWINKING EYESLOOKED ODDLY AT ME AS I CLAIMED MY VALISE IN THE LOBBY AND I HOPEDTHAT NONE OF THESE UNPLEASANT CREATURES WOULD BE MY FELLOWPASSENGERSON THE COACH.THE BUS RATHER EARLY RATTLED IN WITH THREE PASSENGERS SOMEWHATBEFORE EIGHT AND AN EVILLOOKING FELLOW ON THE SIDEWALK MUTTERED AFEW INDISTINGUISHABLE WORDS TO THE DRIVER. I WAS IT APPEARED IN VERYBAD LUCK. THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE ENGINE DESPITE THEEXCELLENT TIME MADE FROM NEWBURYPORT AND THE BUS COULD NOT COMPLETETHE JOURNEY TO ARKHAM. NO IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE REPAIRED THATNIGHT NOR WAS THERE ANY OTHER WAY OF GETTING TRANSPORTATION OUT OFINNSMOUTH EITHER TO ARKHAM OR ELSEWHERE. SARGENT WAS SORRY BUT IWOULD HAVE TO STOP OVER AT THE GILMAN. PROBABLY THE CLERK WOULD MAKETHE PRICE EASY FOR ME BUT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO. ALMOST DAZEDBY THIS SUDDEN OBSTACLE AND VIOLENTLY DREADING THE FALL OF NIGHT INTHIS DECAYING AND HALFUNLIGHTED TOWN I LEFT THE BUS AND REENTEREDTHE HOTEL LOBBY WHERE THE SULLEN QUEERLOOKING NIGHT CLERK TOLD ME ICOULD HAVE ROOM  ON NEXT THE TOP FLOORLARGE BUT WITHOUT RUNNINGWATERFOR A DOLLAR.DESPITE WHAT I HAD HEARD OF THIS HOTEL IN NEWBURYPORT I SIGNED THEREGISTER PAID MY DOLLAR LET THE CLERK TAKE MY VALISE AND FOLLOWEDTHAT SOUR SOLITARY ATTENDANT UP THREE CREAKING FLIGHTS OF STAIRS PASTDUSTY CORRIDORS WHICH SEEMED WHOLLY DEVOID OF LIFE. MY ROOM A DISMALREAR ONE WITH TWO WINDOWS AND BARE CHEAP FURNISHINGS OVERLOOKEDA DINGY COURTYARD OTHERWISE HEMMED IN BY LOW DESERTED BRICK BLOCKSAND COMMANDED A VIEW OF DECREPIT WESTWARDSTRETCHING ROOFS WITH AMARSHY COUNTRYSIDE BEYOND. AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR WAS A BATHROOMADISCOURAGING RELIQUE WITH ANCIENT MARBLE BOWL TIN TUB FAINT ELECTRICLIGHT AND MUSTY WOODEN PANELLING AROUND ALL THE PLUMBING FIXTURES.AS TWILIGHT DEEPENED I TURNED ON THE ONE FEEBLE ELECTRIC BULB OVER THECHEAP IRONFRAMED BED AND TRIED AS BEST I COULD TO READ. I FELT ITADVISABLE TO KEEP MY MIND WHOLESOMELY OCCUPIED FOR IT WOULD NOT DOTO BROOD OVER THE ABNORMALITIES OF THIS ANCIENT BLIGHTSHADOWED TOWNWHILE I WAS STILL WITHIN ITS BORDERS. THE INSANE YARN I HAD HEARD FROMTHE AGED DRUNKARD DID NOT PROMISE VERY PLEASANT DREAMS AND I FELT IMUST KEEP THE IMAGE OF HIS WILD WATERY EYES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM MYIMAGINATION.ANOTHER THING THAT DISTURBED ME WAS THE ABSENCE OF A BOLT ON THE DOOROF MY ROOM. ONE HAD BEEN THERE AS MARKS CLEARLY SHOWED BUT THEREWERE SIGNS OF RECENT REMOVAL. NO DOUBT IT HAD BECOME OUT OF ORDERLIKE SO MANY OTHER THINGS IN THIS DECREPIT EDIFICE. IN MY NERVOUSNESSI LOOKED AROUND AND DISCOVERED A BOLT ON THE CLOTHESPRESS WHICH SEEMEDTO BE OF THE SAME SIZE JUDGING FROM THE MARKS AS THE ONE FORMERLY ONTHE DOOR. TO GAIN A PARTIAL RELIEF FROM THE GENERAL TENSION I BUSIEDMYSELF BY TRANSFERRING THIS HARDWARE TO THE VACANT PLACE WITH THE AIDOF A HANDY THREEINONE DEVICE INCLUDING A SCREWDRIVER WHICH I KEPTON MY KEYRING. THE BOLT FITTED PERFECTLY AND I WAS SOMEWHAT RELIEVEDWHEN I KNEW THAT I COULD SHOOT IT FIRMLY UPON RETIRING. THERE WEREADEQUATE BOLTS ON THE TWO LATERAL DOORS TO CONNECTING ROOMS AND THESEI PROCEEDED TO FASTEN.I DID NOT UNDRESS BUT DECIDED TO READ TILL I WAS SLEEPY AND THENLIE DOWN WITH ONLY MY COAT COLLAR AND SHOES OFF. TAKING A POCKETFLASHLIGHT FROM MY VALISE I PLACED IT IN MY TROUSERS SO THAT ICOULD READ MY WATCH IF I WOKE UP LATER IN THE DARK. DROWSINESSHOWEVER DID NOT COME AND WHEN I STOPPED TO ANALYZE MY THOUGHTS IFOUND TO MY DISQUIET THAT I WAS REALLY UNCONSCIOUSLY LISTENING FORSOMETHINGLISTENING FOR SOMETHING WHICH I DREADED BUT COULD NOT NAME.AT LENGTH FEELING A FATIGUE WHICH HAD NOTHING OF DROWSINESS IN IT IBOLTED THE NEWLY OUTFITTED HALL DOOR TURNED OFF THE LIGHT AND THREWMYSELF DOWN ON THE HARD UNEVEN BEDCOAT COLLAR SHOES AND ALL. INTHE DARKNESS EVERY FAINT NOISE OF THE NIGHT SEEMED MAGNIFIED AND AFLOOD OF DOUBLY UNPLEASANT THOUGHTS SWEPT OVER ME. I WAS SORRY I HADPUT OUT THE LIGHT YET WAS TOO TIRED TO RISE AND TURN IT ON AGAIN.THEN AFTER A LONG DREARY INTERVAL AND PREFACED BY A FRESH CREAKINGOF STAIRS AND CORRIDOR THERE CAME THAT SOFT DAMNABLY UNMISTAKABLESOUND WHICH SEEMED LIKE A MALIGN FULFILMENT OF ALL MY APPREHENSIONS.WITHOUT THE LEAST SHADOW OF A DOUBT THE LOCK ON MY HALL DOOR WAS BEINGTRIEDCAUTIOUSLY FURTIVELY TENTATIVELYWITH A KEY.THE CHANGE IN THE MENACE FROM VAGUE PREMONITION TO IMMEDIATE REALITYWAS A PROFOUND SHOCK AND FELL UPON ME WITH THE FORCE OF A GENUINEBLOW. IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE FUMBLING MIGHT BE A MEREMISTAKE. MALIGN PURPOSE WAS ALL I COULD THINK OF AND I KEPT DEATHLYQUIET AWAITING THE WOULDBE INTRUDERS NEXT MOVE.AFTER A TIME THE CAUTIOUS RATTLING CEASED AND I HEARD THE ROOM TO THENORTH ENTERED WITH A PASS KEY. THEN THE LOCK OF THE CONNECTING DOOR TOMY ROOM WAS SOFTLY TRIED. THE BOLT HELD OF COURSE AND I HEARD THEFLOOR CREAK AS THE PROWLER LEFT THE ROOM. AFTER A MOMENT THERE CAMEANOTHER SOFT RATTLING AND I KNEW THAT THE ROOM TO THE SOUTH OF ME WASBEING ENTERED. AGAIN A FURTIVE TRYING OF A BOLTED CONNECTING DOORAND AGAIN A RECEDING CREAKING. THIS TIME THE CREAKING WENT ALONG THEHALL AND DOWN THE STAIRS SO I KNEW THAT THE PROWLER HAD REALIZED THEBOLTED CONDITION OF MY DOORS AND WAS GIVING UP HIS ATTEMPT FOR A TIME.THE ONE THING TO DO WAS TO GET OUT OF THAT HOTEL ALIVE AS QUICKLY AS ICOULD AND THROUGH SOME CHANNEL OTHER THAN THE FRONT STAIRS AND LOBBYRISING SOFTLY AND THROWING MY FLASHLIGHT ON THE SWITCH I SOUGHTTO LIGHT THE BULB OVER MY BED IN ORDER TO CHOOSE AND POCKET SOMEBELONGINGS FOR A SWIFT VALISELESS FLIGHT. NOTHING HOWEVER HAPPENEDAND I SAW THAT THE POWER HAD BEEN CUT OFF. SO FILLING MY POCKETSWITH THE FLASHLIGHTS AID I PUT ON MY HAT AND TIPTOED TO THEWINDOWS TO CONSIDER CHANCES OF DESCENT. DESPITE THE STATES SAFETYREGULATIONS THERE WAS NO FIRE ESCAPE ON THIS SIDE OF THE HOTEL ANDI SAW THAT MY WINDOWS COMMANDED ONLY A SHEER THREESTORY DROP TO THECOBBLED COURTYARD. ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT HOWEVER SOME ANCIENT BRICKBUSINESS BLOCKS ABUTTED ON THE HOTEL THEIR SLANT ROOFS COMING UP TO AREASONABLE JUMPING DISTANCE FROM MY FOURTHSTORY LEVEL. TO REACH EITHEROF THESE LINES OF BUILDINGS I WOULD HAVE TO BE IN A ROOM TWO DOORSFROM MY OWNIN ONE CASE ON THE NORTH AND IN THE OTHER CASE ON THESOUTHAND MY MIND INSTANTLY SET TO WORK CALCULATING WHAT CHANCES I HADOF MAKING THE TRANSFER.FIRST I REINFORCED MY OWN OUTER DOOR BY PUSHING THE BUREAU AGAINSTITLITTLE BY LITTLE IN ORDER TO MAKE A MINIMUM OF SOUND. THENGATHERING FROM THE GROCERY BOYS MAP THAT THE BEST ROUTE OUT OF TOWNWAS SOUTHWARD I GLANCED FIRST AT THE CONNECTING DOOR ON THE SOUTHSIDE OF THE ROOM. IT WAS DESIGNED TO OPEN IN MY DIRECTION HENCE ISAWAFTER DRAWING THE BOLT AND FINDING OTHER FASTENINGS IN PLACEITWAS NOT A FAVORABLE ONE FOR FORCING. ACCORDINGLY ABANDONING IT AS AROUTE I CAUTIOUSLY MOVED THE BEDSTEAD AGAINST IT TO HAMPER ANY ATTACKWHICH MIGHT BE MADE ON IT LATER FROM THE NEXT ROOM. THE DOOR ON THENORTH WAS HUNG TO OPEN AWAY FROM ME AND THISTHOUGH A TEST PROVEDIT TO BE LOCKED OR BOLTED FROM THE OTHER SIDEI KNEW MUST BE MYROUTE. IF I COULD GAIN THE ROOFS OF THE BUILDINGS IN PAINE STREET ANDDESCEND SUCCESSFULLY TO THE GROUND LEVEL I MIGHT PERHAPS DART THROUGHTHE COURTYARD AND THE ADJACENT OR OPPOSITE BUILDINGS TO WASHINGTONOR BATESOR ELSE EMERGE IN PAINE AND EDGE AROUND SOUTHWARD INTOWASHINGTON. IN ANY CASE I WOULD AIM TO STRIKE WASHINGTON SOMEHOW ANDGET QUICKLY OUT OF THE TOWN SQUARE REGION. MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE TOAVOID PAINE SINCE THE FIRE STATION THERE MIGHT BE OPEN ALL NIGHT.I WAS IRRESOLUTELY SPECULATING ON WHEN I HAD BETTER ATTACK THENORTHWARD DOOR AND ON HOW I COULD LEAST AUDIBLY MANAGE IT WHEN INOTICED THAT THE VAGUE NOISES UNDERFOOT HAD GIVEN PLACE TO A FRESH ANDHEAVIER CREAKING OF THE STAIRS. A WAVERING FLICKER OF LIGHT SHOWEDTHROUGH MY TRANSOM AND THE BOARDS OF THE CORRIDOR BEGAN TO GROAN WITHA PONDEROUS LOAD. MUFFLED SOUNDS OF POSSIBLE VOCAL ORIGIN APPROACHEDAND AT LENGTH A FIRM KNOCK CAME AT MY OUTER DOOR.FOR A MOMENT I SIMPLY HELD MY BREATH AND WAITED. ETERNITIESSEEMED TO ELAPSE AND THE NAUSEOUS FISHY ODOR OF MY ENVIRONMENTSEEMED TO MOUNT SUDDENLY AND SPECTACULARLY. THEN THE KNOCKING WASREPEATEDCONTINUOUSLY AND WITH GROWING INSISTENCE. I KNEW THAT THETIME FOR ACTION HAD COME AND FORTHWITH DREW THE BOLT OF THE NORTHWARDCONNECTING DOOR BRACING MYSELF FOR THE TASK OF BATTERING IT OPEN. THEKNOCKING WAXED LOUDER AND I HOPED THAT ITS VOLUME WOULD COVER THESOUND OF MY EFFORTS. AT LAST BEGINNING MY ATTEMPT I LUNGED AGAIN ANDAGAIN AT THE THIN PANELLING WITH MY LEFT SHOULDER HEEDLESS OF SHOCK ORPAIN.FINALLY THE CONNECTING DOOR GAVE BUT WITH SUCH A CRASH THAT I KNEWTHOSE OUTSIDE MUST HAVE HEARD. INSTANTLY THE OUTSIDE KNOCKING BECAMEA VIOLENT BATTERING WHILE KEYS SOUNDED OMINOUSLY IN THE HALL DOORSOF THE ROOMS ON BOTH SIDES OF ME. RUSHING THROUGH THE NEWLY OPENEDCONNECTION I SUCCEEDED IN BOLTING THE NORTHERLY HALL DOOR BEFORE THELOCK COULD BE TURNED BUT EVEN AS I DID SO I HEARD THE HALL DOOR OF THETHIRD ROOMTHE ONE FROM WHOSE WINDOW I HAD HOPED TO REACH THE ROOFBELOWBEING TRIED WITH A PASS KEY.FOR AN INSTANT I FELT ABSOLUTE DESPAIR SINCE MY TRAPPING IN A CHAMBERWITH NO WINDOW EGRESS SEEMED COMPLETE. THEN WITH A DAZED AUTOMATISMI MADE FOR THE NEXT CONNECTING DOOR AND PERFORMED THE BLIND MOTION OFPUSHING AT IT IN AN EFFORT TO GET THROUGHSHEER FORTUNATE CHANCE GAVE ME MY REPRIEVEFOR THE CONNECTING DOORBEFORE ME WAS NOT ONLY UNLOCKED BUT ACTUALLY AJAR. IN A SECOND I WASTHROUGH AND HAD MY RIGHT KNEE AND SHOULDER AGAINST A HALL DOOR WHICHWAS VISIBLY OPENING INWARD. MY PRESSURE TOOK THE OPENER OFF GUARD FORTHE THING SHUT AS I PUSHED SO THAT I COULD SLIP THE WELLCONDITIONEDBOLT AS I HAD DONE WITH THE OTHER DOOR. AS I GAINED THIS RESPITE IHEARD THE BATTERING AT THE TWO OTHER DOORS ABATE WHILE A CONFUSEDCLATTER CAME FROM THE CONNECTING DOOR I HAD SHIELDED WITH THE BEDSTEAD.EVIDENTLY THE BULK OF MY ASSAILANTS HAD ENTERED THE SOUTHERLY ROOM ANDWERE MASSING IN A LATERAL ATTACK. BUT AT THE SAME MOMENT A PASS KEYSOUNDED IN THE NEXT DOOR TO THE NORTH AND I KNEW THAT A NEARER PERILWAS AT HAND.THE NORTHWARD CONNECTING DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN BUT THERE WAS NO TIME TOTHINK ABOUT CHECKING THE ALREADY TURNING LOCK IN THE HALL. ALL I COULDDO WAS TO SHUT AND BOLT THE OPEN CONNECTING DOOR AS WELL AS ITS MATEON THE OPPOSITE SIDEPUSHING A BEDSTEAD AGAINST THE ONE AND A BUREAUAGAINST THE OTHER AND MOVING A WASHSTAND IN FRONT OF THE HALL DOOR.I MUST I SAW TRUST TO SUCH MAKESHIFT BARRIERS TO SHIELD ME TILL ICOULD GET OUT THE WINDOW AND ON THE ROOF OF THE PAINE STREET BLOCK. BUTEVEN IN THIS ACUTE MOMENT MY CHIEF HORROR WAS SOMETHING APART FROM THEIMMEDIATE WEAKNESS OF MY DEFENSES. I WAS SHUDDERING BECAUSE NOT ONEOF MY PURSUERS DESPITE SOME HIDEOUS PANTINGS GRUNTINGS AND SUBDUEDBARKINGS AT ODD INTERVALS WAS UTTERING AN INTELLIGIBLE VOCAL SOUNDAS I MOVED THE FURNITURE AND RUSHED TOWARD THE WINDOWS I HEARD AFRIGHTFUL SCURRYING ALONG THE CORRIDOR TOWARD THE ROOM NORTH OF ME ANDPERCEIVED THAT THE SOUTHWARD BATTERING HAD CEASED. PLAINLY MOST OF MYOPPONENTS WERE ABOUT TO CONCENTRATE AGAINST THE FEEBLE CONNECTING DOORWHICH THEY KNEW MUST OPEN DIRECTLY ON ME. OUTSIDE THE MOON PLAYED ONTHE RIDGEPOLE OF THE BLOCK BELOW AND I SAW THAT THE JUMP WOULD BEDESPERATELY HAZARDOUS BECAUSE OF THE STEEP SURFACE ON WHICH I MUST LAND.THE CLATTER AT THE NORTHERLY CONNECTING DOOR WAS NOW TERRIFIC ANDI SAW THAT THE WEAK PANELLING WAS BEGINNING TO SPLINTER. OBVIOUSLYTHE BESIEGERS HAD BROUGHT SOME PONDEROUS OBJECT INTO PLAY AS ABATTERINGRAM. THE BEDSTEAD HOWEVER STILL HELD FIRM SO THAT I HAD ATLEAST A FAINT CHANCE OF MAKING GOOD MY ESCAPE. AS I OPENED THE WINDOWI NOTICED THAT IT WAS FLANKED BY HEAVY VELOUR DRAPERIES SUSPENDED FROMA POLE BY BRASS RINGS AND ALSO THAT THERE WAS A LARGE PROJECTINGCATCH FOR THE SHUTTERS ON THE EXTERIOR. SEEING A POSSIBLE MEANS OFAVOIDING THE DANGEROUS JUMP I YANKED AT THE HANGINGS AND BROUGHTTHEM DOWN POLE AND ALL THEN QUICKLY HOOKING TWO OF THE RINGS IN THESHUTTER CATCH AND FLINGING THE DRAPERY OUTSIDE. THE HEAVY FOLDS REACHEDFULLY TO THE ABUTTING ROOF AND I SAW THAT THE RINGS AND CATCH WOULDBE LIKELY TO BEAR MY WEIGHT. SO CLIMBING OUT OF THE WINDOW AND DOWNTHE IMPROVISED ROPE LADDER I LEFT BEHIND ME FOREVER THE MORBID ANDHORRORINFESTED FABRIC OF THE GILMAN HOUSE.I LANDED SAFELY ON THE LOOSE SLATES OF THE STEEP ROOF AND SUCCEEDED INGAINING THE GAPING BLACK SKYLIGHT WITHOUT A SLIP. THE PLACE INSIDE WASGHOULISHLOOKING BUT I WAS PAST MINDING SUCH IMPRESSIONS AND MADE ATONCE FOR THE STAIRCASE REVEALED BY MY FLASHLIGHTAFTER A HASTY GLANCEAT MY WATCH WHICH SHOWED THE HOUR TO BE  A.M. THE STEPS CREAKED BUTSEEMED TOLERABLY SOUND AND I RACED DOWN PAST A BARNLIKE SECOND STORYTO THE GROUND FLOOR. THE DESOLATION WAS COMPLETE AND ONLY ECHOESANSWERED MY FOOTFALLS.THE HALLWAY INSIDE WAS BLACK AND WHEN I REACHED THE OPPOSITE END I SAWTHAT THE STREET DOOR WAS WEDGED IMMOVABLY SHUT. RESOLVED TO TRY ANOTHERBUILDING I GROPED MY WAY TOWARD THE COURTYARD BUT STOPPED SHORT WHENCLOSE TO THE DOORWAY.FOR OUT OF AN OPENED DOOR IN THE GILMAN HOUSE A LARGE CROWD OF DOUBTFULSHAPES WAS POURINGLANTERNS BOBBING IN THE DARKNESS AND HORRIBLECROAKING VOICES EXCHANGING LOW CRIES IN WHAT WAS CERTAINLY NOT ENGLISH.THEIR FEATURES WERE INDISTINGUISHABLE BUT THEIR CROUCHING SHAMBLINGGAIT WAS ABOMINABLY REPELLENT. AND WORST OF ALL I PERCEIVED THAT ONEFIGURE WAS STRANGELY ROBED AND UNMISTAKABLY SURMOUNTED BY A TALL TIARAOF A DESIGN ALTOGETHER TOO FAMILIAR. AGAIN GROPING TOWARD THE STREETI OPENED A DOOR OFF THE HALL AND CAME UPON AN EMPTY ROOM WITH CLOSELYSHUTTERED BUT SASHLESS WINDOWS. FUMBLING IN THE RAYS OF MY FLASHLIGHTI FOUND I COULD OPEN THE SHUTTERS AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT HAD CLIMBEDOUTSIDE AND WAS CAREFULLY CLOSING THE APERTURE IN ITS ORIGINAL MANNER.I WALKED RAPIDLY SOFTLY AND CLOSE TO THE RUINED HOUSES. AT BATESSTREET I DREW INTO A YAWNING VESTIBULE WHILE TWO SHAMBLING FIGURESCROSSED IN FRONT OF ME BUT WAS SOON ON MY WAY AGAIN AND APPROACHINGTHE OPEN SPACE WHERE ELIOT STREET OBLIQUELY CROSSES WASHINGTON AT THEINTERSECTION OF SOUTH. THOUGH I HAD NEVER SEEN THIS SPACE IT HADLOOKED DANGEROUS TO ME ON THE GROCERY YOUTHS MAP SINCE THE MOONLIGHTWOULD HAVE FREE PLAY THERE. THERE WAS NO USE TRYING TO EVADE IT FORANY ALTERNATIVE COURSE WOULD INVOLVE DETOURS OF POSSIBLY DISASTROUSVISIBILITY AND DELAYING EFFECT. THE ONLY THING TO DO WAS TO CROSS ITBOLDLY AND OPENLY IMITATING THE TYPICAL SHAMBLE OF THE INNSMOUTH FOLKAS BEST I COULD AND TRUSTING THAT NO ONEOR AT LEAST NO PURSUER OFMINEWOULD BE THERE.JUST HOW FULLY THE PURSUIT WAS ORGANIZEDAND INDEED JUST WHAT ITSPURPOSE MIGHT BEI COULD FORM NO IDEA. THERE SEEMED TO BE UNUSUALACTIVITY IN THE TOWN BUT I JUDGED THAT THE NEWS OF MY ESCAPE FROMTHE GILMAN HAD NOT YET SPREAD. THE OPEN SPACE WAS AS I HAD EXPECTEDSTRONGLY MOONLIT. BUT MY PROGRESS WAS UNIMPEDED AND NO FRESH SOUNDAROSE TO HINT THAT I HAD BEEN SPIED. GLANCING ABOUT ME I INVOLUNTARILYLET MY PACE SLACKEN FOR A SECOND TO TAKE IN THE SIGHT OF THE SEAGORGEOUS IN THE BURNING MOONLIGHT AT THE STREETS END. FAR OUT BEYONDTHE BREAKWATER WAS THE DIM DARK LINE OF DEVIL REEF.THEN WITHOUT WARNING I SAW THE INTERMITTENT FLASHES OF LIGHT ON THEDISTANT REEF. MY MUSCLES TIGHTENED FOR PANIC FLIGHT HELD IN ONLY BY ACERTAIN UNCONSCIOUS CAUTION AND HALFHYPNOTIC FASCINATION. AND TO MAKEMATTERS WORSE THERE NOW FLASHED FORTH FROM THE LOFTY CUPOLA OF THEGILMAN HOUSE WHICH LOOMED UP TO THE NORTHEAST BEHIND ME A SERIES OFANALOGOUS THOUGH DIFFERENTLY SPACED GLEAMS WHICH COULD BE NOTHING LESSTHAN AN ANSWERING SIGNAL.I NOW BENT TO THE LEFT AROUND THE RUINOUS GREEN STILL GAZING TOWARDTHE OCEAN AS IT BLAZED IN THE SPECTRAL SUMMER MOONLIGHT AND WATCHINGTHE CRYPTICAL FLASHING OF THOSE NAMELESS UNEXPLAINABLE BEACONS.IT WAS THEN THAT THE MOST HORRIBLE IMPRESSION OF ALL WAS BORNE IN UPONMETHE IMPRESSION WHICH DESTROYED MY LAST VESTIGE OF SELFCONTROL ANDSENT ME RUNNING FRANTICALLY SOUTHWARD PAST THE YAWNING BLACK DOORWAYSAND FISHILY STARING WINDOWS OF THAT DESERTED NIGHTMARE STREET. FOR ATA CLOSER GLANCE I SAW THAT THE MOONLIT WATERS BETWEEN THE REEF ANDTHE SHORE WERE FAR FROM EMPTY. THEY WERE ALIVE WITH A TEEMING HORDE OFSHAPES SWIMMING INWARD TOWARD THE TOWNMY FRANTIC RUNNING CEASED BEFORE I HAD COVERED A BLOCK FOR AT MY LEFTI BEGAN TO HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THE HUE AND CRY OF ORGANIZED PURSUIT.THERE WERE FOOTSTEPS AND GUTTURAL SOUNDS AND A RATTLING MOTOR WHEEZEDSOUTH ALONG FEDERAL STREET. IN A SECOND ALL MY PLANS WERE UTTERLYCHANGEDFOR IF THE SOUTHWARD HIGHWAY WERE BLOCKED AHEAD OF ME I MUSTCLEARLY FIND ANOTHER EGRESS FROM INNSMOUTH. I PAUSED AND DREW INTO AGAPING DOORWAY REFLECTING HOW LUCKY I WAS TO HAVE LEFT THE MOONLITOPEN SPACE BEFORE THESE PURSUERS CAME DOWN THE PARALLEL STREET.THEN I THOUGHT OF THE ABANDONED RAILWAY TO ROWLEY WHOSE SOLID LINE OFBALLASTED WEEDGROWN EARTH STILL STRETCHED OFF TO THE NORTHWEST FROMTHE CRUMBLING STATION ON THE EDGE OF THE RIVER GORGE. THERE WAS JUST ACHANCE THAT THE TOWNSFOLK WOULD NOT THINK OF THATDRAWING INSIDE THE HALL OF MY DESERTED SHELTER I ONCE MORE CONSULTEDTHE GROCERY BOYS MAP WITH THE AID OF THE FLASHLIGHT. THE IMMEDIATEPROBLEM WAS HOW TO REACH THE ANCIENT RAILWAY AND I NOW SAW THAT THESAFEST COURSE WAS AHEAD TO BABSON STREET THEN WEST TO LAFAYETTETHEREEDGING AROUND BUT NOT CROSSING AN OPEN SPACE HOMOLOGOUS TO THE ONEI HAD TRAVERSEDAND SUBSEQUENTLY BACK NORTHWARD AND WESTWARD INZIGZAGGING LINE THROUGH LAFAYETTE BATES ADAMS AND BANKS STREETSTHELATTER SKIRTING THE RIVER GORGETO THE ABANDONED AND DILAPIDATEDSTATION I HAD SEEN FROM MY WINDOW. MY REASON FOR GOING AHEAD TO BABSONWAS THAT I WISHED NEITHER TO RECROSS THE EARLIER OPEN SPACE NOR TOBEGIN MY WESTWARD COURSE ALONG A CROSS STREET AS BROAD AS SOUTH. ICROSSED THE STREET TO THE RIGHTHAND SIDE IN ORDER TO EDGE AROUND INTOBABSON AS INCONSPICUOUSLY AS POSSIBLE.IN BABSON STREET I CLUNG AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO THE SAGGINGUNEVEN BUILDINGS TWICE PAUSING IN A DOORWAY AS THE NOISES BEHIND MEMOMENTARILY INCREASED. THE OPEN SPACE AHEAD SHONE WIDE AND DESOLATEUNDER THE MOON BUT MY ROUTE WOULD NOT FORCE ME TO CROSS IT. DURINGMY SECOND PAUSE I BEGAN TO DETECT A FRESH DISTRIBUTION OF THE VAGUESOUNDS AND UPON LOOKING CAUTIOUSLY OUT FROM COVER BEHELD A MOTOR CARDARTING ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE BOUND OUTWARD ALONG ELIOT STREET.AS I WATCHEDCHOKED BY A SUDDEN RISE IN THE FISHY ODOR AFTER A SHORTABATEMENTI SAW A BAND OF UNCOUTH CROUCHING SHAPES LOPING ANDSHAMBLING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND KNEW THAT THIS MUST BE THE PARTYGUARDING THE IPSWICH ROAD SINCE THAT HIGHWAY FORMS AN EXTENSION OFELIOT STREET. TWO OF THE FIGURES I GLIMPSED WERE IN VOLUMINOUS ROBESAND ONE WORE A PEAKED DIADEM WHICH GLISTENED WHITELY IN THE MOONLIGHT.THE GAIT OF THIS FIGURE WAS SO ODD THAT IT SENT A CHILL THROUGH MEFORIT SEEMED TO ME THE CREATURE WAS ALMOST HOPPING.WHEN THE LAST OF THE BAND WAS OUT OF SIGHT I RESUMED MY PROGRESSDARTING AROUND THE CORNER INTO LAFAYETTE STREET AND CROSSING ELIOTVERY HURRIEDLY LEST STRAGGLERS OF THE PARTY BE STILL ADVANCING ALONGTHAT THOROUGHFARE. I DID HEAR SOME CROAKING AND CLATTERING SOUNDSFAR OFF TOWARD TOWN SQUARE BUT ACCOMPLISHED THE PASSAGE WITHOUTDISASTER. MY GREATEST DREAD WAS IN RECROSSING BROAD AND MOONLIT SOUTHSTREETWITH ITS SEAWARD VIEWAND I HAD TO NERVE MYSELF FOR THEORDEAL. SOMEONE MIGHT EASILY BE LOOKING AND POSSIBLE ELIOT STREETSTRAGGLERS COULD NOT FAIL TO GLIMPSE ME FROM EITHER OF TWO POINTS. ATTHE LAST MOMENT I DECIDED I HAD BETTER SLACKEN MY TROT AND MAKE THECROSSING AS BEFORE IN THE SHAMBLING GAIT OF AN AVERAGE INNSMOUTH NATIVE.I HAD NOT QUITE CROSSED THE STREET WHEN I HEARD A MUTTERING BANDADVANCING ALONG WASHINGTON FROM THE NORTH. AS THEY REACHED THE BROADOPEN SPACE WHERE I HAD HAD MY FIRST DISQUIETING GLIMPSE OF THE MOONLITWATER I COULD SEE THEM PLAINLY ONLY A BLOCK AWAYAND WAS HORRIFIED BYTHE BESTIAL ABNORMALITY OF THEIR FACES AND THE DOGLIKE SUBHUMANNESSOF THEIR CROUCHING GAIT. ONE MAN MOVED IN A POSITIVELY SIMIAN WAY WITHLONG ARMS FREQUENTLY TOUCHING THE GROUND WHILE ANOTHER FIGUREROBEDAND TIARAEDSEEMED TO PROGRESS IN AN ALMOST HOPPING FASHION. I JUDGEDTHIS PARTY TO BE THE ONE I HAD SEEN IN THE GILMANS COURTYARDTHE ONETHEREFORE MOST CLOSELY ON MY TRAIL. AS SOME OF THE FIGURES TURNEDTO LOOK IN MY DIRECTION I WAS TRANSFIXED WITH FRIGHT YET MANAGED TOPRESERVE THE CASUAL SHAMBLING GAIT I HAD ASSUMED. TO THIS DAY I DONOT KNOW WHETHER THEY SAW ME OR NOT. IF THEY DID MY STRATAGEM MUSTHAVE DECEIVED THEM FOR THEY PASSED ON ACROSS THE MOONLIT SPACE WITHOUTVARYING THEIR COURSEMEANWHILE CROAKING AND JABBERING IN SOME HATEFULGUTTURAL PATOIS I COULD NOT IDENTIFY.ONCE MORE IN SHADOW I RESUMED MY FORMER DOGTROT PAST THE LEANING ANDDECREPIT HOUSES THAT STARED BLANKLY INTO THE NIGHT. HAVING CROSSED TOTHE WESTERN SIDEWALK I ROUNDED THE NEAREST CORNER INTO BATES STREETWHERE I KEPT CLOSE TO THE BUILDINGS ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE. AT LAST I SAWTHE ANCIENT ARCADED STATIONOR WHAT WAS LEFT OF ITAND MADE DIRECTLYFOR THE TRACKS THAT STARTED FROM ITS FARTHER END.THE RAILS WERE RUSTY BUT MAINLY INTACT AND NOT MORE THAN HALF THETIES HAD ROTTED AWAY. WALKING OR RUNNING ON SUCH A SURFACE WAS VERYDIFFICULT BUT I DID MY BEST AND ON THE WHOLE MADE VERY FAIR TIME. FORSOME DISTANCE THE LINE KEPT ON ALONG THE GORGES BRINK BUT AT LENGTH IREACHED THE LONG COVERED BRIDGE WHERE IT CROSSED THE CHASM AT A DIZZYHEIGHT. THE CONDITION OF THIS BRIDGE WOULD DETERMINE MY NEXT STEP. IFHUMANLY POSSIBLE I WOULD USE IT IF NOT I WOULD HAVE TO RISK MORESTREET WANDERING AND TAKE THE NEAREST INTACT HIGHWAY BRIDGE.THE VAST BARNLIKE LENGTH OF THE OLD BRIDGE GLEAMED SPECTRALLY IN THEMOONLIGHT AND I SAW THAT THE TIES WERE SAFE FOR AT LEAST A FEW FEETWITHIN. ENTERING I BEGAN TO USE MY FLASHLIGHT AND WAS ALMOST KNOCKEDDOWN BY THE CLOUD OF BATS THAT FLAPPED PAST ME. ABOUT HALFWAY ACROSSTHERE WAS A PERILOUS GAP IN THE TIES WHICH I FEARED FOR A MOMENT WOULDHALT ME BUT IN THE END I RISKED A DESPERATE JUMP WHICH FORTUNATELYSUCCEEDED.I WAS GLAD TO SEE THE MOONLIGHT AGAIN WHEN I EMERGED FROM THAT MACABRETUNNEL. THE OLD TRACKS CROSSED RIVER STREET AT A GRADE AND AT ONCEVEERED OFF INTO A REGION INCREASINGLY RURAL AND WITH LESS AND LESS OFINNSMOUTHS ABHORRENT FISHY ODOR. HERE THE DENSE GROWTH OF WEEDS ANDBRIERS HINDERED ME AND CRUELLY TORE MY CLOTHES BUT I WAS NONE THE LESSGLAD THAT THEY WERE THERE TO GIVE ME CONCEALMENT IN CASE OF PERIL. IKNEW THAT MUCH OF MY ROUTE MUST BE VISIBLE FROM THE ROWLEY ROAD.THE MARSHY REGION BEGAN VERY SHORTLY WITH THE SINGLE TRACK ON A LOWGRASSY EMBANKMENT. THEN CAME A SORT OF ISLAND OF HIGHER GROUND WHERETHE LINE PASSED THROUGH A SHALLOW OPEN CUT CHOKED WITH BUSHES ANDBRAMBLES. I WAS VERY GLAD OF THIS PARTIAL SHELTER SINCE AT THIS POINTTHE ROWLEY ROAD WAS UNCOMFORTABLY NEAR ACCORDING TO MY WINDOW VIEW.JUST BEFORE ENTERING THE CUT I GLANCED BEHIND ME BUT SAW NO PURSUER.THE ANCIENT SPIRES AND ROOFS OF DECAYING INNSMOUTH GLEAMED LOVELY ANDETHEREAL IN THE MAGIC YELLOW MOONLIGHT AND I THOUGHT OF HOW THEY MUSTHAVE LOOKED IN THE OLD DAYS BEFORE THE SHADOW FELL. THEN AS MY GAZECIRCLED INLAND FROM THE TOWN SOMETHING LESS TRANQUIL ARRESTED MYNOTICE AND HELD ME IMMOBILE FOR A SECOND.WHAT I SAWOR FANCIED I SAWWAS A DISTURBING SUGGESTION OF UNDULANTMOTION FAR TO THE SOUTH A SUGGESTION WHICH MADE ME CONCLUDE THATA VERY LARGE HORDE MUST BE POURING OUT OF THE CITY ALONG THE LEVELIPSWICH ROAD. THE DISTANCE WAS GREAT AND I COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHINGIN DETAIL BUT I DID NOT AT ALL LIKE THE LOOK OF THAT MOVING COLUMN.ALL SORTS OF UNPLEASANT CONJECTURES CROSSED MY MIND. I THOUGHT OF THOSEVERY EXTREME INNSMOUTH TYPES SAID TO BE HIDDEN IN CRUMBLING CENTURIEDWARRENS NEAR THE WATERFRONT. I THOUGHT TOO OF THOSE NAMELESS SWIMMERSI HAD SEEN. COUNTING THE PARTIES SO FAR GLIMPSED AS WELL AS THOSEPRESUMABLY COVERING OTHER ROADS THE NUMBER OF MY PURSUERS MUST BESTRANGELY LARGE FOR A TOWN AS DEPOPULATED AS INNSMOUTH.WHO WERE THEY WHY WERE THEY HERE AND IF SUCH A COLUMN OF THEM WASSCOURING THE IPSWICH ROAD WOULD THE PATROLS ON THE OTHER ROADS BELIKEWISE AUGMENTEDI HAD ENTERED THE BRUSHGROWN CUT AND WAS STRUGGLING ALONG AT A VERYSLOW PACE WHEN THAT DAMNABLE FISHY ODOR AGAIN WAXED DOMINANT. THEREWERE SOUNDS TOOA KIND OF WHOLESALE COLOSSAL FLOPPING OR PATTERINGWHICH SOMEHOW CALLED UP IMAGES OF THE MOST DETESTABLE SORT.AND THEN BOTH STENCH AND SOUNDS GREW STRONGER SO THAT I PAUSEDSHIVERING AND GRATEFUL FOR THE CUTS PROTECTION. IT WAS HERE IRECALLED THAT THE ROWLEY ROAD DREW SO CLOSE TO THE OLD RAILWAY BEFORECROSSING WESTWARD AND DIVERGING. SOMETHING WAS COMING ALONG THAT ROADAND I MUST LIE LOW TILL ITS PASSAGE AND VANISHMENT IN THE DISTANCE.CROUCHED IN THE BUSHES OF THAT SANDY CLEFT I FELT REASONABLY SAFE EVENTHOUGH I KNEW THE SEARCHERS WOULD HAVE TO CROSS THE TRACK IN FRONT OFME NOT MUCH MORE THAN A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY. I WOULD BE ABLE TO SEETHEM BUT THEY COULD NOT EXCEPT BY A MALIGN MIRACLE SEE ME.ALL AT ONCE I BEGAN DREADING TO LOOK AT THEM AS THEY PASSED. I SAW THECLOSE MOONLIT SPACE WHERE THEY WOULD SURGE BY AND HAD CURIOUS THOUGHTSABOUT THE IRREDEEMABLE POLLUTION OF THAT SPACE. THEY WOULD PERHAPSBE THE WORST OF ALL INNSMOUTH TYPESSOMETHING ONE WOULD NOT CARE TOREMEMBER.THE STENCH WAXED OVERPOWERING AND THE NOISES SWELLED TO A BESTIALBABEL OF CROAKING BAYING AND BARKING WITHOUT THE LEAST SUGGESTIONOF HUMAN SPEECH. WERE THESE INDEED THE VOICES OF MY PURSUERS THATFLOPPING OR PATTERING WAS MONSTROUSI COULD NOT LOOK UPON THEDEGENERATE CREATURES RESPONSIBLE FOR IT. I WOULD KEEP MY EYES SHUT TILLTHE SOUNDS RECEDED TOWARD THE WEST. THE HORDE WAS VERY CLOSE NOWTHEAIR FOUL WITH THEIR HOARSE SNARLINGS AND THE GROUND ALMOST SHAKINGWITH THEIR ALIENRHYTHMED FOOTFALLS. MY BREATH NEARLY CEASED TO COMEAND I PUT EVERY OUNCE OF WILLPOWER INTO THE TASK OF HOLDING MY EYELIDSDOWN.I AM NOT EVEN YET WILLING TO SAY WHETHER WHAT FOLLOWED WAS A HIDEOUSACTUALITY OR ONLY A NIGHTMARE HALLUCINATION. THE LATER ACTION OF THEGOVERNMENT AFTER MY FRANTIC APPEALS WOULD TEND TO CONFIRM IT AS AMONSTROUS TRUTH BUT COULD NOT AN HALLUCINATION HAVE BEEN REPEATEDUNDER THE QUASIHYPNOTIC SPELL OF THAT ANCIENT HAUNTED AND SHADOWEDTOWNBUT I MUST TRY TO TELL WHAT I THOUGHT I SAW THAT NIGHT UNDER THEMOCKING YELLOW MOONSAW SURGING AND HOPPING DOWN THE ROWLEY ROAD INPLAIN SIGHT IN FRONT OF ME AS I CROUCHED AMONG THE WILD BRAMBLES OFTHAT DESOLATE RAILWAY CUT. OF COURSE MY RESOLUTION TO KEEP MY EYES SHUTHAD FAILED. IT WAS FOREDOOMED TO FAILUREFOR WHO COULD CROUCH BLINDLYWHILE A LEGION OF CROAKING BAYING ENTITIES OF UNKNOWN SOURCE FLOPPEDNOISOMELY PAST SCARCELY MORE THAN A HUNDRED YARDS AWAYFOR I KNEW THAT A LONG SECTION OF THEM MUST BE PLAINLY IN SIGHT WHERETHE SIDES OF THE CUT FLATTENED OUT AND THE ROAD CROSSED THE TRACKANDI COULD NO LONGER KEEP MYSELF FROM SAMPLING WHATEVER HORROR THATLEERING YELLOW MOON MIGHT HAVE TO SHOW.IT WAS THE END FOR WHATEVER REMAINS TO ME OF LIFE ON THE SURFACE OFTHIS EARTH OF EVERY VESTIGE OF MENTAL PEACE AND CONFIDENCE IN THEINTEGRITY OF NATURE AND OF THE HUMAN MIND. CAN IT BE POSSIBLE THAT THISPLANET HAS ACTUALLY SPAWNED SUCH THINGS THAT HUMAN EYES HAVE TRULYSEEN AS OBJECTIVE FLESH WHAT MAN HAS HITHERTO KNOWN ONLY IN FEBRILEPHANTASY AND TENUOUS LEGENDAND YET I SAW THEM IN A LIMITLESS STREAMFLOPPING HOPPING CROAKINGBLEATINGSURGING INHUMANLY THROUGH THE SPECTRAL MOONLIGHT IN AGROTESQUE MALIGNANT SARABAND OF FANTASTIC NIGHTMARE. AND SOME OF THEMHAD TALL TIARAS OF THAT NAMELESS WHITISHGOLD METAL ... AND SOME WERESTRANGELY ROBED ... AND ONE WHO LED THE WAY WAS CLAD IN A GHOULISHLYHUMPED BLACK COAT AND STRIPED TROUSERS AND HAD A MANS FELT HATPERCHED ON THE SHAPELESS THING THAT ANSWERED FOR A HEAD....I THINK THEIR PREDOMINANT COLOR WAS A GRAYISHGREEN THOUGH THEY HADWHITE BELLIES. THEY WERE MOSTLY SHINY AND SLIPPERY BUT THE RIDGES OFTHEIR BACKS WERE SCALY. THEIR FORMS VAGUELY SUGGESTED THE ANTHROPOIDWHILE THEIR HEADS WERE THE HEADS OF FISH WITH PRODIGIOUS BULGING EYESTHAT NEVER CLOSED. AT THE SIDES OF THEIR NECKS WERE PALPITATING GILLSAND THEIR LONG PAWS WERE WEBBED. THEY HOPPED IRREGULARLY SOMETIMES ONTWO LEGS AND SOMETIMES ON FOUR. I WAS SOMEHOW GLAD THAT THEY HAD NOMORE THAN FOUR LIMBS. THEIR CROAKING BAYING VOICES CLEARLY USED FORARTICULATE SPEECH HELD ALL THE DARK SHADES OF EXPRESSION WHICH THEIRSTARING FACES LACKED.BUT FOR ALL OF THEIR MONSTROUSNESS THEY WERE NOT UNFAMILIAR TO ME. IKNEW TOO WELL WHAT THEY MUST BEFOR WAS NOT THE MEMORY OF THAT EVILTIARA AT NEWBURYPORT STILL FRESH THEY WERE THE BLASPHEMOUS FISHFROGSOF THE NAMELESS DESIGNLIVING AND HORRIBLEAND AS I SAW THEM I KNEWALSO OF WHAT THAT HUMPED TIARAED PRIEST IN THE BLACK CHURCH BASEMENTHAD SO FEARSOMELY REMINDED ME. THEIR NUMBER WAS PAST GUESSING. ITSEEMED TO ME THAT THERE WERE LIMITLESS SWARMS OF THEMAND CERTAINLY MYMOMENTARY GLIMPSE COULD HAVE SHOWN ONLY THE LEAST FRACTION. IN ANOTHERINSTANT EVERYTHING WAS BLOTTED OUT BY A MERCIFUL FIT OF FAINTING THEFIRST I HAD EVER HAD.                                   VIT WAS A GENTLE DAYLIGHT RAIN THAT AWAKED ME FROM MY STUPOR IN THEBRUSHGROWN RAILWAY CUT AND WHEN I STAGGERED OUT TO THE ROADWAY AHEADI SAW NO TRACE OF ANY PRINTS IN THE FRESH MUD. INNSMOUTHS RUINED ROOFSAND TOPPLING STEEPLES LOOMED UP GRAYLY TOWARD THE SOUTHEAST BUT NOT ALIVING CREATURE DID I SPY IN ALL THE DESOLATE SALT MARSHES AROUND. MYWATCH WAS STILL GOING AND TOLD ME THAT THE HOUR WAS PAST NOON.THE REALITY OF WHAT I HAD BEEN THROUGH WAS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN IN MY MINDBUT I FELT THAT SOMETHING HIDEOUS LAY IN THE BACKGROUND. I MUST GETAWAY FROM EVILSHADOWED INNSMOUTHAND ACCORDINGLY I BEGAN TO TESTMY CRAMPED WEARIED POWERS OF LOCOMOTION. DESPITE WEAKNESS HUNGERHORROR AND BEWILDERMENT I FOUND MYSELF AFTER A TIME ABLE TO WALK SOSTARTED SLOWLY ALONG THE MUDDY ROAD TO ROWLEY. BEFORE EVENING I WASIN THE VILLAGE GETTING A MEAL AND PROVIDING MYSELF WITH PRESENTABLECLOTHES. I CAUGHT THE NIGHT TRAIN TO ARKHAM AND THE NEXT DAY TALKEDLONG AND EARNESTLY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THERE A PROCESS I LATERREPEATED IN BOSTON. WITH THE MAIN RESULT OF THESE COLLOQUIES THE PUBLICIS NOW FAMILIARAND I WISH FOR NORMALITYS SAKE THERE WERE NOTHINGMORE TO TELL. PERHAPS IT IS MADNESS THAT IS OVERTAKING MEYET PERHAPSA GREATER HORROROR A GREATER MARVELIS REACHING OUT.I DARED NOT LOOK FOR THAT PIECE OF STRANGE JEWELRY SAID TO BE IN THEMISKATONIC UNIVERSITY MUSEUM. I DID HOWEVER IMPROVE MY STAY IN ARKHAMBY COLLECTING SOME GENEALOGICAL NOTES I HAD LONG WISHED TO POSSESSVERY ROUGH AND HASTY DATA IT IS TRUE BUT CAPABLE OF GOOD USE LATERON WHEN I MIGHT HAVE TIME TO COLLATE AND CODIFY THEM. THE CURATOR OFTHE HISTORICAL SOCIETY THEREMR. E. LAPHAM PEABODYWAS VERY COURTEOUSABOUT ASSISTING ME AND EXPRESSED UNUSUAL INTEREST WHEN I TOLD HIM IWAS A GRANDSON OF ELIZA ORNE OF ARKHAM WHO WAS BORN IN  AND HADMARRIED JAMES WILLIAMSON OF OHIO AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN.IT SEEMED THAT A MATERNAL UNCLE OF MINE HAD BEEN THERE MANY YEARSBEFORE ON A QUEST MUCH LIKE MY OWN AND THAT MY GRANDMOTHERS FAMILYWAS A TOPIC OF SOME LOCAL CURIOSITY. THERE HAD MR. PEABODY SAID BEENCONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MARRIAGE OF HER FATHER BENJAMINORNE JUST AFTER THE CIVIL WAR SINCE THE ANCESTRY OF THE BRIDE WASPECULIARLY PUZZLING. THAT BRIDE WAS UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE BEEN AN ORPHANEDMARSH OF NEW HAMPSHIREA COUSIN OF THE ESSEX COUNTY MARSHESBUT HEREDUCATION HAD BEEN IN FRANCE AND SHE KNEW VERY LITTLE OF HER FAMILY. AGUARDIAN HAD DEPOSITED FUNDS IN A BOSTON BANK TO MAINTAIN HER AND HERFRENCH GOVERNESS BUT THAT GUARDIANS NAME WAS UNFAMILIAR TO ARKHAMPEOPLE AND IN TIME HE DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT SO THAT THE GOVERNESSASSUMED HIS ROLE BY COURT APPOINTMENT. THE FRENCHWOMANNOW LONGDEADWAS VERY TACITURN AND THERE WERE THOSE WHO SAID SHE COULD HAVETOLD MORE THAN SHE DID.BUT THE MOST BAFFLING THING WAS THE INABILITY OF ANYONE TO PLACETHE RECORDED PARENTS OF THE YOUNG WOMANENOCH AND LYDIA MESERVEMARSHAMONG THE KNOWN FAMILIES OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. POSSIBLYMANY SUGGESTED SHE WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOME MARSH OFPROMINENCESHE CERTAINLY HAD THE TRUE MARSH EYES. MOST OF THEPUZZLING WAS DONE AFTER HER EARLY DEATH WHICH TOOK PLACE AT THE BIRTHOF MY GRANDMOTHERHER ONLY CHILD. HAVING FORMED SOME DISAGREEABLEIMPRESSIONS CONNECTED WITH THE NAME OF MARSH I DID NOT WELCOME THENEWS THAT IT BELONGED ON MY OWN ANCESTRAL TREE NOR WAS I PLEASEDBY MR. PEABODYS SUGGESTION THAT I HAD THE TRUE MARSH EYES MYSELF.HOWEVER I WAS GRATEFUL FOR DATA WHICH I KNEW WOULD PROVE VALUABLEAND TOOK COPIOUS NOTES AND LISTS OF BOOK REFERENCES REGARDING THEWELLDOCUMENTED ORNE FAMILY.I WENT DIRECTLY HOME TO TOLEDO FROM BOSTON AND LATER SPENT A MONTHAT MAUMEE RECUPERATING FROM MY ORDEAL. IN SEPTEMBER I ENTERED OBERLINFOR MY FINAL YEAR AND FROM THEN TILL THE NEXT JUNE WAS BUSY WITHSTUDIES AND OTHER WHOLESOME ACTIVITIESREMINDED OF THE BYGONE TERRORONLY BY OCCASIONAL OFFICIAL VISITS FROM GOVERNMENT MEN IN CONNECTIONWITH THE CAMPAIGN WHICH MY PLEAS AND EVIDENCE HAD STARTED. AROUND THEMIDDLE OF JULYJUST A YEAR AFTER THE INNSMOUTH EXPERIENCEI SPENT AWEEK WITH MY LATE MOTHERS FAMILY IN CLEVELAND CHECKING SOME OF MYNEW GENEALOGICAL DATA WITH THE VARIOUS NOTES TRADITIONS AND BITSOF HEIRLOOM MATERIAL IN EXISTENCE THERE AND SEEING WHAT KIND OF ACONNECTED CHART I COULD CONSTRUCT.I DID NOT EXACTLY RELISH THIS TASK FOR THE ATMOSPHERE OF THEWILLIAMSON HOME HAD ALWAYS DEPRESSED ME. THERE WAS A STRAIN OFMORBIDITY THERE AND MY MOTHER HAD NEVER ENCOURAGED MY VISITING HERPARENTS AS A CHILD ALTHOUGH SHE ALWAYS WELCOMED HER FATHER WHENHE CAME TO TOLEDO. MY ARKHAMBORN GRANDMOTHER HAD SEEMED STRANGEAND ALMOST TERRIFYING TO ME AND I DO NOT THINK I GRIEVED WHEN SHEDISAPPEARED. I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD THEN AND IT WAS SAID THAT SHE HADWANDERED OFF IN GRIEF AFTER THE SUICIDE OF MY UNCLE DOUGLAS HER ELDESTSON. HE HAD SHOT HIMSELF AFTER A TRIP TO NEW ENGLANDTHE SAME TRIPNO DOUBT WHICH HAD CAUSED HIM TO BE RECALLED AT THE ARKHAM HISTORICALSOCIETY.THIS UNCLE HAD RESEMBLED HER AND I HAD NEVER LIKED HIM EITHER.SOMETHING ABOUT THE STARING UNWINKING EXPRESSION OF BOTH OF THEMHAD GIVEN ME A VAGUE UNACCOUNTABLE UNEASINESS. MY MOTHER AND UNCLEWALTER HAD NOT LOOKED LIKE THAT. THEY WERE LIKE THEIR FATHER THOUGHPOOR LITTLE COUSIN LAWRENCEWALTERS SONHAD BEEN AN ALMOST PERFECTDUPLICATE OF HIS GRANDMOTHER BEFORE HIS CONDITION TOOK HIM TO THEPERMANENT SECLUSION OF A SANITARIUM AT CANTON. I HAD NOT SEEN HIM INFOUR YEARS BUT MY UNCLE ONCE IMPLIED THAT HIS STATE BOTH MENTAL ANDPHYSICAL WAS VERY BAD. THIS WORRY HAD PROBABLY BEEN A MAJOR CAUSE OFHIS MOTHERS DEATH TWO YEARS BEFORE.MY GRANDFATHER AND HIS WIDOWERED SON WALTER NOW COMPRISED THE CLEVELANDHOUSEHOLD BUT THE MEMORY OF OLDER TIMES HUNG THICKLY OVER IT. I STILLDISLIKED THE PLACE AND TRIED TO GET MY RESEARCHES DONE AS QUICKLY ASPOSSIBLE. WILLIAMSON RECORDS AND TRADITIONS WERE SUPPLIED IN ABUNDANCEBY MY GRANDFATHER THOUGH FOR ORNE MATERIAL I HAD TO DEPEND ON MY UNCLEWALTER WHO PUT AT MY DISPOSAL THE CONTENTS OF ALL HIS FILES INCLUDINGNOTES LETTERS CUTTINGS HEIRLOOMS PHOTOGRAPHS AND MINIATURES.IT WAS IN GOING OVER THE LETTERS AND PICTURES ON THE ORNE SIDE THAT IBEGAN TO ACQUIRE A KIND OF TERROR OF MY OWN ANCESTRY. AS I HAVE SAIDMY GRANDMOTHER AND UNCLE DOUGLAS HAD ALWAYS DISTURBED ME. NOW YEARSAFTER THEIR PASSING I GAZED AT THEIR PICTURED FACES WITH A MEASURABLYHEIGHTENED FEELING OF REPULSION AND ALIENATION. I COULD NOT AT FIRSTUNDERSTAND THE CHANGE BUT GRADUALLY A HORRIBLE SORT OF COMPARISONBEGAN TO OBTRUDE ITSELF ON MY UNCONSCIOUS MIND DESPITE THE STEADYREFUSAL OF MY CONSCIOUSNESS TO ADMIT EVEN THE LEAST SUSPICION OF IT.IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE TYPICAL EXPRESSION OF THESE FACES NOW SUGGESTEDSOMETHING IT HAD NOT SUGGESTED BEFORESOMETHING WHICH WOULD BRINGSTARK PANIC IF TOO OPENLY THOUGHT OF.BUT THE WORST SHOCK CAME WHEN MY UNCLE SHOWED ME THE ORNE JEWELRY INA DOWNTOWN SAFEDEPOSIT VAULT. SOME OF THE ITEMS WERE DELICATE ANDINSPIRING ENOUGH BUT THERE WAS ONE BOX OF STRANGE OLD PIECES DESCENDEDFROM MY MYSTERIOUS GREATGRANDMOTHER WHICH MY UNCLE WAS ALMOSTRELUCTANT TO PRODUCE. THEY WERE HE SAID OF VERY GROTESQUE AND ALMOSTREPULSIVE DESIGN.AS MY UNCLE BEGAN SLOWLY AND GRUDGINGLY TO UNWRAP THE THINGS HE URGEDME NOT TO BE SHOCKED BY THE STRANGENESS AND FREQUENT HIDEOUSNESS OFTHE DESIGNS. THERE WERE TWO ARMLETS A TIARA AND A KIND OF PECTORALTHE LATTER HAVING IN HIGH RELIEF CERTAIN FIGURES OF ALMOST UNBEARABLEEXTRAVAGANCE.HE SEEMED TO EXPECT SOME DEMONSTRATION WHEN THE FIRST PIECETHETIARABECAME VISIBLE BUT I DOUBT IF HE EXPECTED QUITE WHAT ACTUALLYHAPPENED. I DID NOT EXPECT IT EITHER FOR I THOUGHT I WAS THOROUGHLYFOREWARNED REGARDING WHAT THE JEWELRY WOULD TURN OUT TO BE. WHAT I DIDWAS TO FAINT SILENTLY AWAY JUST AS I HAD DONE IN THAT BRIERCHOKEDRAILWAY CUT A YEAR BEFORE.FROM THAT DAY ON MY LIFE HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE OF BROODING ANDAPPREHENSION NOR DO I KNOW HOW MUCH IS HIDEOUS TRUTH AND HOW MUCHMADNESS. MY GREATGRANDMOTHER HAD BEEN A MARSH OF UNKNOWN SOURCE WHOSEHUSBAND LIVED IN ARKHAMAND DID NOT OLD ZADOK SAY THAT THE DAUGHTER OFOBED MARSH BY A MONSTROUS MOTHER WAS MARRIED TO AN ARKHAM MAN THROUGHA TRICK WHAT WAS IT THE ANCIENT TOPER HAD MUTTERED ABOUT THE LIKENESSOF MY EYES TO CAPTAIN OBEDS IN ARKHAM TOO THE CURATOR HAD TOLD ME IHAD THE TRUE MARSH EYES. WAS OBED MARSH MY OWN GREATGREATGRANDFATHERWHOOR WHATTHEN WAS MY GREATGREATGRANDMOTHER BUT PERHAPSTHIS WAS ALL MADNESS. THOSE WHITISHGOLD ORNAMENTS MIGHT EASILYHAVE BEEN BOUGHT FROM SOME INNSMOUTH SAILOR BY THE FATHER OF MYGREATGRANDMOTHER WHOEVER HE WAS. AND THAT LOOK IN THE STARINGEYEDFACES OF MY GRANDMOTHER AND SELFSLAIN UNCLE MIGHT BE SHEER FANCYBOLSTERED UP BY THE INNSMOUTH SHADOW WHICH HAD SO DARKLY COLORED MYIMAGINATION. BUT WHY HAD MY UNCLE KILLED HIMSELF AFTER AN ANCESTRALQUEST IN NEW ENGLANDFOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS I FOUGHT OFF THESE REFLECTIONS WITH PARTIALSUCCESS. MY FATHER SECURED ME A PLACE IN AN INSURANCE OFFICE ANDI BURIED MYSELF IN ROUTINE AS DEEPLY AS POSSIBLE. IN THE WINTER OF HOWEVER THE DREAMS BEGAN. THEY WERE VERY SPARSE AND INSIDIOUSAT FIRST BUT INCREASED IN FREQUENCY AND VIVIDNESS AS THE WEEKS WENTBY. GREAT WATERY SPACES OPENED OUT BEFORE ME AND I SEEMED TO WANDERTHROUGH TITANIC SUNKEN PORTICOS AND LABYRINTHS OF WEEDY CYCLOPEAN WALLSAND GROTESQUE FISHES AS MY COMPANIONS. THEN THE OTHER SHAPES BEGAN TOAPPEAR FILLING ME WITH NAMELESS HORROR THE MOMENT I AWOKE. BUT DURINGTHE DREAMS THEY DID NOT HORRIFY ME AT ALLI WAS ONE WITH THEM WEARINGTHEIR UNHUMAN TRAPPINGS TREADING THEIR AQUEOUS WAYS AND PRAYINGMONSTROUSLY AT THEIR EVIL SEABOTTOM TEMPLES.THERE WAS MUCH MORE THAN I COULD REMEMBER BUT EVEN WHAT I DID REMEMBEREACH MORNING WOULD BE ENOUGH TO STAMP ME AS A MADMAN OR A GENIUS IFEVER I DARED WRITE IT DOWN. SOME FRIGHTFUL INFLUENCE I FELT WASSEEKING GRADUALLY TO DRAG ME OUT OF THE SANE WORLD OF WHOLESOME LIFEINTO UNNAMEABLE ABYSSES OF BLACKNESS AND ALIENAGE AND THE PROCESSTOLD HEAVILY ON ME. MY HEALTH AND APPEARANCE GREW STEADILY WORSE TILLFINALLY I WAS FORCED TO GIVE UP MY POSITION AND ADOPT THE STATICSECLUDED LIFE OF AN INVALID. SOME ODD NERVOUS AFFLICTION HAD ME IN ITSGRIP AND I FOUND MYSELF AT TIMES ALMOST UNABLE TO SHUT MY EYES.IT WAS THEN THAT I BEGAN TO STUDY THE MIRROR WITH MOUNTING ALARM. THESLOW RAVAGES OF DISEASE ARE NOT PLEASANT TO WATCH BUT IN MY CASE THEREWAS SOMETHING SUBTLER AND MORE PUZZLING IN THE BACKGROUND. MY FATHERSEEMED TO NOTICE IT TOO FOR HE BEGAN LOOKING AT ME CURIOUSLY ANDALMOST AFFRIGHTEDLY. WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE IN ME COULD IT BE THAT IWAS COMING TO RESEMBLE MY GRANDMOTHER AND UNCLE DOUGLASONE NIGHT I HAD A FRIGHTFUL DREAM IN WHICH I MET MY GRANDMOTHERUNDER THE SEA. SHE LIVED IN A PHOSPHORESCENT PALACE OF MANYTERRACES WITH GARDENS OF STRANGE LEPROUS CORALS AND GROTESQUEBRACHIATE EFFLORESCENCES AND WELCOMED ME WITH A WARMTH THAT MAYHAVE BEEN SARDONIC. SHE HAD CHANGEDAS THOSE WHO TAKE TO THE WATERCHANGEAND TOLD ME SHE HAD NEVER DIED. INSTEAD SHE HAD GONE TO ASPOT HER DEAD SON HAD LEARNED ABOUT AND HAD LEAPED TO A REALM WHOSEWONDERSDESTINED FOR HIM AS WELLHE HAD SPURNED WITH A SMOKINGPISTOL. THIS WAS TO BE MY REALM TOOI COULD NOT ESCAPE IT. I WOULDNEVER DIE BUT WOULD LIVE WITH THOSE WHO HAD LIVED SINCE BEFORE MANEVER WALKED THE EARTH.ILLUSTRATION ONE NIGHT IN A FRIGHTFUL DREAM I MET TWO ANCIENT ONESUNDER THE SEA IN A PHOSPHORESCENT MANY TERRACED PALACE SURROUNDED BYGARDENS OF STRANGE LEPROUS CORALS.I MET ALSO THAT WHICH HAD BEEN HER GRANDMOTHER. FOR EIGHTY THOUSANDYEARS PTHTHYALYI HAD LIVED IN YHANTHLEI AND THITHER SHE HAD GONEBACK AFTER OBED MARSH WAS DEAD. YHANTHLEI WAS NOT DESTROYED WHENTHE UPPEREARTH MEN SHOT DEATH INTO THE SEA. IT WAS HURT BUT NOTDESTROYED. THE DEEP ONES COULD NEVER BE DESTROYED EVEN THOUGH THEPALAEOGEAN MAGIC OF THE FORGOTTEN OLD ONES MIGHT SOMETIMES CHECK THEM.FOR THE PRESENT THEY WOULD REST BUT SOME DAY IF THEY REMEMBERED THEYWOULD RISE AGAIN FOR THE TRIBUTE GREAT CTHULHU CRAVED. IT WOULD BE ACITY GREATER THAN INNSMOUTH NEXT TIME. THEY HAD PLANNED TO SPREAD ANDHAD BROUGHT UP THAT WHICH WOULD HELP THEM BUT NOW THEY MUST WAIT ONCEMORE. FOR BRINGING THE UPPEREARTH MENS DEATH I MUST DO A PENANCEBUT THAT WOULD NOT BE HEAVY. THIS WAS THE DREAM IN WHICH I SAW ASHOGGOTH FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE SIGHT SET ME AWAKE IN A FRENZYOF SCREAMING. THAT MORNING THE MIRROR DEFINITELY TOLD ME I HAD ACQUIREDTHE INNSMOUTH LOOK.SO FAR I HAVE NOT SHOT MYSELF AS MY UNCLE DOUGLAS DID. I BOUGHT ANAUTOMATIC AND ALMOST TOOK THE STEP BUT CERTAIN DREAMS DETERRED ME. THETENSE EXTREMES OF HORROR ARE LESSENING AND I FEEL QUEERLY DRAWN TOWARDTHE UNKNOWN SEADEEPS INSTEAD OF FEARING THEM. I HEAR AND DO STRANGETHINGS IN SLEEP AND AWAKE WITH A KIND OF EXALTATION INSTEAD OF TERROR.I DO NOT BELIEVE I NEED TO WAIT FOR THE FULL CHANGE AS MOST HAVEWAITED. IF I DID MY FATHER WOULD PROBABLY SHUT ME UP IN A SANITARIUMAS MY POOR LITTLE COUSIN IS SHUT UP. STUPENDOUS AND UNHEARDOFSPLENDORS AWAIT ME BELOW AND I SHALL SEEK THEM SOON. IRLYEHCTHULHU FHTAGN I I NO I SHALL NOT SHOOT MYSELFI CANNOTBE MADE TO SHOOT MYSELFI SHALL PLAN MY COUSINS ESCAPE FROM THAT CANTON MADHOUSE AND TOGETHERWE SHALL GO TO MARVELSHADOWED INNSMOUTH. WE SHALL SWIM OUT TO THATBROODING REEF IN THE SEA AND DIVE DOWN THROUGH BLACK ABYSSES TOCYCLOPEAN AND MANYCOLUMNED YHANTHLEI AND IN THAT LAIR OF THE DEEPONES WE SHALL DWELL AMIDST WONDER AND GLORY FOREVER.\n",
      "THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDEBY ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSONCONTENTS STORY OF THE DOOR SEARCH FOR MR. HYDE DR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE THE CAREW MURDER CASE INCIDENT OF THE LETTER INCIDENT OF DR. LANYON INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW THE LAST NIGHT DR. LANYONS NARRATIVE HENRY JEKYLLS FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASESTORY OF THE DOORMR. UTTERSON THE LAWYER WAS A MAN OF A RUGGED COUNTENANCE THAT WASNEVER LIGHTED BY A SMILE COLD SCANTY AND EMBARRASSED IN DISCOURSEBACKWARD IN SENTIMENT LEAN LONG DUSTY DREARY AND YET SOMEHOWLOVABLE. AT FRIENDLY MEETINGS AND WHEN THE WINE WAS TO HIS TASTESOMETHING EMINENTLY HUMAN BEACONED FROM HIS EYE SOMETHING INDEED WHICHNEVER FOUND ITS WAY INTO HIS TALK BUT WHICH SPOKE NOT ONLY IN THESESILENT SYMBOLS OF THE AFTERDINNER FACE BUT MORE OFTEN AND LOUDLY INTHE ACTS OF HIS LIFE. HE WAS AUSTERE WITH HIMSELF DRANK GIN WHEN HEWAS ALONE TO MORTIFY A TASTE FOR VINTAGES AND THOUGH HE ENJOYED THETHEATRE HAD NOT CROSSED THE DOORS OF ONE FOR TWENTY YEARS. BUT HE HADAN APPROVED TOLERANCE FOR OTHERS SOMETIMES WONDERING ALMOST WITHENVY AT THE HIGH PRESSURE OF SPIRITS INVOLVED IN THEIR MISDEEDS ANDIN ANY EXTREMITY INCLINED TO HELP RATHER THAN TO REPROVE. I INCLINE TOCAINS HERESY HE USED TO SAY QUAINTLY I LET MY BROTHER GO TO THEDEVIL IN HIS OWN WAY. IN THIS CHARACTER IT WAS FREQUENTLY HIS FORTUNETO BE THE LAST REPUTABLE ACQUAINTANCE AND THE LAST GOOD INFLUENCE INTHE LIVES OF DOWNGOING MEN. AND TO SUCH AS THESE SO LONG AS THEY CAMEABOUT HIS CHAMBERS HE NEVER MARKED A SHADE OF CHANGE IN HIS DEMEANOUR.NO DOUBT THE FEAT WAS EASY TO MR. UTTERSON FOR HE WAS UNDEMONSTRATIVEAT THE BEST AND EVEN HIS FRIENDSHIP SEEMED TO BE FOUNDED IN A SIMILARCATHOLICITY OF GOODNATURE. IT IS THE MARK OF A MODEST MAN TO ACCEPTHIS FRIENDLY CIRCLE READYMADE FROM THE HANDS OF OPPORTUNITY AND THATWAS THE LAWYERS WAY. HIS FRIENDS WERE THOSE OF HIS OWN BLOOD OR THOSEWHOM HE HAD KNOWN THE LONGEST HIS AFFECTIONS LIKE IVY WERE THEGROWTH OF TIME THEY IMPLIED NO APTNESS IN THE OBJECT. HENCE NO DOUBTTHE BOND THAT UNITED HIM TO MR. RICHARD ENFIELD HIS DISTANT KINSMANTHE WELLKNOWN MAN ABOUT TOWN. IT WAS A NUT TO CRACK FOR MANY WHATTHESE TWO COULD SEE IN EACH OTHER OR WHAT SUBJECT THEY COULD FIND INCOMMON. IT WAS REPORTED BY THOSE WHO ENCOUNTERED THEM IN THEIR SUNDAYWALKS THAT THEY SAID NOTHING LOOKED SINGULARLY DULL AND WOULD HAILWITH OBVIOUS RELIEF THE APPEARANCE OF A FRIEND. FOR ALL THAT THE TWOMEN PUT THE GREATEST STORE BY THESE EXCURSIONS COUNTED THEM THE CHIEFJEWEL OF EACH WEEK AND NOT ONLY SET ASIDE OCCASIONS OF PLEASURE BUTEVEN RESISTED THE CALLS OF BUSINESS THAT THEY MIGHT ENJOY THEMUNINTERRUPTED.IT CHANCED ON ONE OF THESE RAMBLES THAT THEIR WAY LED THEM DOWN ABYSTREET IN A BUSY QUARTER OF LONDON. THE STREET WAS SMALL AND WHAT ISCALLED QUIET BUT IT DROVE A THRIVING TRADE ON THE WEEKDAYS. THEINHABITANTS WERE ALL DOING WELL IT SEEMED AND ALL EMULOUSLY HOPING TODO BETTER STILL AND LAYING OUT THE SURPLUS OF THEIR GRAINS INCOQUETRY SO THAT THE SHOP FRONTS STOOD ALONG THAT THOROUGHFARE WITH ANAIR OF INVITATION LIKE ROWS OF SMILING SALESWOMEN. EVEN ON SUNDAYWHEN IT VEILED ITS MORE FLORID CHARMS AND LAY COMPARATIVELY EMPTY OFPASSAGE THE STREET SHONE OUT IN CONTRAST TO ITS DINGY NEIGHBOURHOODLIKE A FIRE IN A FOREST AND WITH ITS FRESHLY PAINTED SHUTTERSWELLPOLISHED BRASSES AND GENERAL CLEANLINESS AND GAIETY OF NOTEINSTANTLY CAUGHT AND PLEASED THE EYE OF THE PASSENGER.TWO DOORS FROM ONE CORNER ON THE LEFT HAND GOING EAST THE LINE WASBROKEN BY THE ENTRY OF A COURT AND JUST AT THAT POINT A CERTAINSINISTER BLOCK OF BUILDING THRUST FORWARD ITS GABLE ON THE STREET. ITWAS TWO STOREYS HIGH SHOWED NO WINDOW NOTHING BUT A DOOR ON THE LOWERSTOREY AND A BLIND FOREHEAD OF DISCOLOURED WALL ON THE UPPER AND BOREIN EVERY FEATURE THE MARKS OF PROLONGED AND SORDID NEGLIGENCE. THEDOOR WHICH WAS EQUIPPED WITH NEITHER BELL NOR KNOCKER WAS BLISTEREDAND DISTAINED. TRAMPS SLOUCHED INTO THE RECESS AND STRUCK MATCHES ONTHE PANELS CHILDREN KEPT SHOP UPON THE STEPS THE SCHOOLBOY HAD TRIEDHIS KNIFE ON THE MOULDINGS AND FOR CLOSE ON A GENERATION NO ONE HADAPPEARED TO DRIVE AWAY THESE RANDOM VISITORS OR TO REPAIR THEIRRAVAGES.MR. ENFIELD AND THE LAWYER WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BYSTREET BUTWHEN THEY CAME ABREAST OF THE ENTRY THE FORMER LIFTED UP HIS CANE ANDPOINTED.DID YOU EVER REMARK THAT DOOR HE ASKED AND WHEN HIS COMPANION HADREPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE IT IS CONNECTED IN MY MIND ADDED HEWITH A VERY ODD STORY.INDEED SAID MR. UTTERSON WITH A SLIGHT CHANGE OF VOICE AND WHATWAS THATWELL IT WAS THIS WAY RETURNED MR. ENFIELD I WAS COMING HOME FROMSOME PLACE AT THE END OF THE WORLD ABOUT THREE OCLOCK OF A BLACKWINTER MORNING AND MY WAY LAY THROUGH A PART OF TOWN WHERE THERE WASLITERALLY NOTHING TO BE SEEN BUT LAMPS. STREET AFTER STREET AND ALL THEFOLKS ASLEEPSTREET AFTER STREET ALL LIGHTED UP AS IF FOR A PROCESSIONAND ALL AS EMPTY AS A CHURCHTILL AT LAST I GOT INTO THAT STATE OF MINDWHEN A MAN LISTENS AND LISTENS AND BEGINS TO LONG FOR THE SIGHT OF APOLICEMAN. ALL AT ONCE I SAW TWO FIGURES ONE A LITTLE MAN WHO WASSTUMPING ALONG EASTWARD AT A GOOD WALK AND THE OTHER A GIRL OF MAYBEEIGHT OR TEN WHO WAS RUNNING AS HARD AS SHE WAS ABLE DOWN A CROSSSTREET. WELL SIR THE TWO RAN INTO ONE ANOTHER NATURALLY ENOUGH AT THECORNER AND THEN CAME THE HORRIBLE PART OF THE THING FOR THE MANTRAMPLED CALMLY OVER THE CHILDS BODY AND LEFT HER SCREAMING ON THEGROUND. IT SOUNDS NOTHING TO HEAR BUT IT WAS HELLISH TO SEE. IT WASNTLIKE A MAN IT WAS LIKE SOME DAMNED JUGGERNAUT. I GAVE A FEW HALLOATOOK TO MY HEELS COLLARED MY GENTLEMAN AND BROUGHT HIM BACK TO WHERETHERE WAS ALREADY QUITE A GROUP ABOUT THE SCREAMING CHILD. HE WASPERFECTLY COOL AND MADE NO RESISTANCE BUT GAVE ME ONE LOOK SO UGLYTHAT IT BROUGHT OUT THE SWEAT ON ME LIKE RUNNING. THE PEOPLE WHO HADTURNED OUT WERE THE GIRLS OWN FAMILY AND PRETTY SOON THE DOCTOR FORWHOM SHE HAD BEEN SENT PUT IN HIS APPEARANCE. WELL THE CHILD WAS NOTMUCH THE WORSE MORE FRIGHTENED ACCORDING TO THE SAWBONES AND THEREYOU MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED WOULD BE AN END TO IT. BUT THERE WAS ONECURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE. I HAD TAKEN A LOATHING TO MY GENTLEMAN AT FIRSTSIGHT. SO HAD THE CHILDS FAMILY WHICH WAS ONLY NATURAL. BUT THEDOCTORS CASE WAS WHAT STRUCK ME. HE WAS THE USUAL CUT AND DRYAPOTHECARY OF NO PARTICULAR AGE AND COLOUR WITH A STRONG EDINBURGHACCENT AND ABOUT AS EMOTIONAL AS A BAGPIPE. WELL SIR HE WAS LIKE THEREST OF US EVERY TIME HE LOOKED AT MY PRISONER I SAW THAT SAWBONESTURN SICK AND WHITE WITH THE DESIRE TO KILL HIM. I KNEW WHAT WAS IN HISMIND JUST AS HE KNEW WHAT WAS IN MINE AND KILLING BEING OUT OF THEQUESTION WE DID THE NEXT BEST. WE TOLD THE MAN WE COULD AND WOULD MAKESUCH A SCANDAL OUT OF THIS AS SHOULD MAKE HIS NAME STINK FROM ONE ENDOF LONDON TO THE OTHER. IF HE HAD ANY FRIENDS OR ANY CREDIT WEUNDERTOOK THAT HE SHOULD LOSE THEM. AND ALL THE TIME AS WE WEREPITCHING IT IN RED HOT WE WERE KEEPING THE WOMEN OFF HIM AS BEST WECOULD FOR THEY WERE AS WILD AS HARPIES. I NEVER SAW A CIRCLE OF SUCHHATEFUL FACES AND THERE WAS THE MAN IN THE MIDDLE WITH A KIND OFBLACK SNEERING COOLNESSFRIGHTENED TOO I COULD SEE THATBUT CARRYINGIT OFF SIR REALLY LIKE SATAN. IF YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE CAPITAL OUT OFTHIS ACCIDENT SAID HE I AM NATURALLY HELPLESS. NO GENTLEMAN BUTWISHES TO AVOID A SCENE SAYS HE. NAME YOUR FIGURE. WELL WE SCREWEDHIM UP TO A HUNDRED POUNDS FOR THE CHILDS FAMILY HE WOULD HAVECLEARLY LIKED TO STICK OUT BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE LOT OF USTHAT MEANT MISCHIEF AND AT LAST HE STRUCK. THE NEXT THING WAS TO GETTHE MONEY AND WHERE DO YOU THINK HE CARRIED US BUT TO THAT PLACE WITHTHE DOORWHIPPED OUT A KEY WENT IN AND PRESENTLY CAME BACK WITH THEMATTER OF TEN POUNDS IN GOLD AND A CHEQUE FOR THE BALANCE ON COUTTSSDRAWN PAYABLE TO BEARER AND SIGNED WITH A NAME THAT I CANT MENTIONTHOUGH ITS ONE OF THE POINTS OF MY STORY BUT IT WAS A NAME AT LEASTVERY WELL KNOWN AND OFTEN PRINTED. THE FIGURE WAS STIFF BUT THESIGNATURE WAS GOOD FOR MORE THAN THAT IF IT WAS ONLY GENUINE. I TOOKTHE LIBERTY OF POINTING OUT TO MY GENTLEMAN THAT THE WHOLE BUSINESSLOOKED APOCRYPHAL AND THAT A MAN DOES NOT IN REAL LIFE WALK INTO ACELLAR DOOR AT FOUR IN THE MORNING AND COME OUT WITH ANOTHER MANSCHEQUE FOR CLOSE UPON A HUNDRED POUNDS. BUT HE WAS QUITE EASY ANDSNEERING. SET YOUR MIND AT REST SAYS HE I WILL STAY WITH YOU TILLTHE BANKS OPEN AND CASH THE CHEQUE MYSELF. SO WE ALL SET OFF THEDOCTOR AND THE CHILDS FATHER AND OUR FRIEND AND MYSELF AND PASSEDTHE REST OF THE NIGHT IN MY CHAMBERS AND NEXT DAY WHEN WE HADBREAKFASTED WENT IN A BODY TO THE BANK. I GAVE IN THE CHEQUE MYSELFAND SAID I HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE IT WAS A FORGERY. NOT A BIT OFIT. THE CHEQUE WAS GENUINE.TUTTUT SAID MR. UTTERSON.I SEE YOU FEEL AS I DO SAID MR. ENFIELD. YES ITS A BAD STORY. FORMY MAN WAS A FELLOW THAT NOBODY COULD HAVE TO DO WITH A REALLYDAMNABLE MAN AND THE PERSON THAT DREW THE CHEQUE IS THE VERY PINK OFTHE PROPRIETIES CELEBRATED TOO AND WHAT MAKES IT WORSE ONE OF YOURFELLOWS WHO DO WHAT THEY CALL GOOD. BLACKMAIL I SUPPOSE AN HONEST MANPAYING THROUGH THE NOSE FOR SOME OF THE CAPERS OF HIS YOUTH. BLACK MAILHOUSE IS WHAT I CALL THE PLACE WITH THE DOOR IN CONSEQUENCE. THOUGHEVEN THAT YOU KNOW IS FAR FROM EXPLAINING ALL HE ADDED AND WITHTHE WORDS FELL INTO A VEIN OF MUSING.FROM THIS HE WAS RECALLED BY MR. UTTERSON ASKING RATHER SUDDENLY ANDYOU DONT KNOW IF THE DRAWER OF THE CHEQUE LIVES THEREA LIKELY PLACE ISNT IT RETURNED MR. ENFIELD. BUT I HAPPEN TO HAVENOTICED HIS ADDRESS HE LIVES IN SOME SQUARE OR OTHER.AND YOU NEVER ASKED ABOUT THEPLACE WITH THE DOOR SAID MR. UTTERSON.NO SIR I HAD A DELICACY WAS THE REPLY. I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUTPUTTING QUESTIONS IT PARTAKES TOO MUCH OF THE STYLE OF THE DAY OFJUDGMENT. YOU START A QUESTION AND ITS LIKE STARTING A STONE. YOU SITQUIETLY ON THE TOP OF A HILL AND AWAY THE STONE GOES STARTING OTHERSAND PRESENTLY SOME BLAND OLD BIRD THE LAST YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OFIS KNOCKED ON THE HEAD IN HIS OWN BACK GARDEN AND THE FAMILY HAVE TOCHANGE THEIR NAME. NO SIR I MAKE IT A RULE OF MINE THE MORE IT LOOKSLIKE QUEER STREET THE LESS I ASK.A VERY GOOD RULE TOO SAID THE LAWYER.BUT I HAVE STUDIED THE PLACE FOR MYSELF CONTINUED MR. ENFIELD. ITSEEMS SCARCELY A HOUSE. THERE IS NO OTHER DOOR AND NOBODY GOES IN OROUT OF THAT ONE BUT ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE THE GENTLEMAN OF MYADVENTURE. THERE ARE THREE WINDOWS LOOKING ON THE COURT ON THE FIRSTFLOOR NONE BELOW THE WINDOWS ARE ALWAYS SHUT BUT THEYRE CLEAN. ANDTHEN THERE IS A CHIMNEY WHICH IS GENERALLY SMOKING SO SOMEBODY MUSTLIVE THERE. AND YET ITS NOT SO SURE FOR THE BUILDINGS ARE SO PACKEDTOGETHER ABOUT THE COURT THAT ITS HARD TO SAY WHERE ONE ENDS ANDANOTHER BEGINS.THE PAIR WALKED ON AGAIN FOR A WHILE IN SILENCE AND THEN ENFIELDSAID MR. UTTERSON THATS A GOOD RULE OF YOURS.YES I THINK IT IS RETURNED ENFIELD.BUT FOR ALL THAT CONTINUED THE LAWYER THERES ONE POINT I WANT TOASK. I WANT TO ASK THE NAME OF THAT MAN WHO WALKED OVER THE CHILD.WELL SAID MR. ENFIELD I CANT SEE WHAT HARM IT WOULD DO. IT WAS AMAN OF THE NAME OF HYDE.HM SAID MR. UTTERSON. WHAT SORT OF A MAN IS HE TO SEEHE IS NOT EASY TO DESCRIBE. THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HISAPPEARANCE SOMETHING DISPLEASING SOMETHING DOWNRIGHT DETESTABLE. INEVER SAW A MAN I SO DISLIKED AND YET I SCARCE KNOW WHY. HE MUST BEDEFORMED SOMEWHERE HE GIVES A STRONG FEELING OF DEFORMITY ALTHOUGH ICOULDNT SPECIFY THE POINT. HES AN EXTRAORDINARY LOOKING MAN AND YETI REALLY CAN NAME NOTHING OUT OF THE WAY. NO SIR I CAN MAKE NO HANDOF IT I CANT DESCRIBE HIM. AND ITS NOT WANT OF MEMORY FOR I DECLAREI CAN SEE HIM THIS MOMENT.MR. UTTERSON AGAIN WALKED SOME WAY IN SILENCE AND OBVIOUSLY UNDER AWEIGHT OF CONSIDERATION. YOU ARE SURE HE USED A KEY HE INQUIRED ATLAST.MY DEAR SIR... BEGAN ENFIELD SURPRISED OUT OF HIMSELF.YES I KNOW SAID UTTERSON I KNOW IT MUST SEEM STRANGE. THE FACTIS IF I DO NOT ASK YOU THE NAME OF THE OTHER PARTY IT IS BECAUSE IKNOW IT ALREADY. YOU SEE RICHARD YOUR TALE HAS GONE HOME. IF YOU HAVEBEEN INEXACT IN ANY POINT YOU HAD BETTER CORRECT IT.I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE WARNED ME RETURNED THE OTHER WITH A TOUCH OFSULLENNESS. BUT I HAVE BEEN PEDANTICALLY EXACT AS YOU CALL IT. THEFELLOW HAD A KEY AND WHATS MORE HE HAS IT STILL. I SAW HIM USE ITNOT A WEEK AGO.MR. UTTERSON SIGHED DEEPLY BUT SAID NEVER A WORD AND THE YOUNG MANPRESENTLY RESUMED. HERE IS ANOTHER LESSON TO SAY NOTHING SAID HE. IAM ASHAMED OF MY LONG TONGUE. LET US MAKE A BARGAIN NEVER TO REFER TOTHIS AGAIN.WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE LAWYER. I SHAKE HANDS ON THAT RICHARD.SEARCH FOR MR. HYDETHAT EVENING MR. UTTERSON CAME HOME TO HIS BACHELOR HOUSE IN SOMBRESPIRITS AND SAT DOWN TO DINNER WITHOUT RELISH. IT WAS HIS CUSTOM OF ASUNDAY WHEN THIS MEAL WAS OVER TO SIT CLOSE BY THE FIRE A VOLUME OFSOME DRY DIVINITY ON HIS READING DESK UNTIL THE CLOCK OF THENEIGHBOURING CHURCH RANG OUT THE HOUR OF TWELVE WHEN HE WOULD GOSOBERLY AND GRATEFULLY TO BED. ON THIS NIGHT HOWEVER AS SOON AS THECLOTH WAS TAKEN AWAY HE TOOK UP A CANDLE AND WENT INTO HIS BUSINESSROOM. THERE HE OPENED HIS SAFE TOOK FROM THE MOST PRIVATE PART OF IT ADOCUMENT ENDORSED ON THE ENVELOPE AS DR. JEKYLLS WILL AND SAT DOWNWITH A CLOUDED BROW TO STUDY ITS CONTENTS. THE WILL WAS HOLOGRAPH FORMR. UTTERSON THOUGH HE TOOK CHARGE OF IT NOW THAT IT WAS MADE HADREFUSED TO LEND THE LEAST ASSISTANCE IN THE MAKING OF IT IT PROVIDEDNOT ONLY THAT IN CASE OF THE DECEASE OF HENRY JEKYLL M.D. D.C.L.L.L.D. F.R.S. ETC. ALL HIS POSSESSIONS WERE TO PASS INTO THE HANDSOF HIS FRIEND AND BENEFACTOR EDWARD HYDE BUT THAT IN CASE OF DR.JEKYLLS DISAPPEARANCE OR UNEXPLAINED ABSENCE FOR ANY PERIOD EXCEEDINGTHREE CALENDAR MONTHS THE SAID EDWARD HYDE SHOULD STEP INTO THE SAIDHENRY JEKYLLS SHOES WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY AND FREE FROM ANY BURTHEN OROBLIGATION BEYOND THE PAYMENT OF A FEW SMALL SUMS TO THE MEMBERS OF THEDOCTORS HOUSEHOLD. THIS DOCUMENT HAD LONG BEEN THE LAWYERS EYESORE.IT OFFENDED HIM BOTH AS A LAWYER AND AS A LOVER OF THE SANE ANDCUSTOMARY SIDES OF LIFE TO WHOM THE FANCIFUL WAS THE IMMODEST. ANDHITHERTO IT WAS HIS IGNORANCE OF MR. HYDE THAT HAD SWELLED HISINDIGNATION NOW BY A SUDDEN TURN IT WAS HIS KNOWLEDGE. IT WASALREADY BAD ENOUGH WHEN THE NAME WAS BUT A NAME OF WHICH HE COULD LEARNNO MORE. IT WAS WORSE WHEN IT BEGAN TO BE CLOTHED UPON WITH DETESTABLEATTRIBUTES AND OUT OF THE SHIFTING INSUBSTANTIAL MISTS THAT HAD SOLONG BAFFLED HIS EYE THERE LEAPED UP THE SUDDEN DEFINITE PRESENTMENTOF A FIEND.I THOUGHT IT WAS MADNESS HE SAID AS HE REPLACED THE OBNOXIOUS PAPERIN THE SAFE AND NOW I BEGIN TO FEAR IT IS DISGRACE.WITH THAT HE BLEW OUT HIS CANDLE PUT ON A GREATCOAT AND SET FORTH INTHE DIRECTION OF CAVENDISH SQUARE THAT CITADEL OF MEDICINE WHERE HISFRIEND THE GREAT DR. LANYON HAD HIS HOUSE AND RECEIVED HIS CROWDINGPATIENTS. IF ANYONE KNOWS IT WILL BE LANYON HE HAD THOUGHT.THE SOLEMN BUTLER KNEW AND WELCOMED HIM HE WAS SUBJECTED TO NO STAGEOF DELAY BUT USHERED DIRECT FROM THE DOOR TO THE DININGROOM WHERE DR.LANYON SAT ALONE OVER HIS WINE. THIS WAS A HEARTY HEALTHY DAPPERREDFACED GENTLEMAN WITH A SHOCK OF HAIR PREMATURELY WHITE AND ABOISTEROUS AND DECIDED MANNER. AT SIGHT OF MR. UTTERSON HE SPRANG UPFROM HIS CHAIR AND WELCOMED HIM WITH BOTH HANDS. THE GENIALITY AS WASTHE WAY OF THE MAN WAS SOMEWHAT THEATRICAL TO THE EYE BUT IT REPOSEDON GENUINE FEELING. FOR THESE TWO WERE OLD FRIENDS OLD MATES BOTH ATSCHOOL AND COLLEGE BOTH THOROUGH RESPECTORS OF THEMSELVES AND OF EACHOTHER AND WHAT DOES NOT ALWAYS FOLLOW MEN WHO THOROUGHLY ENJOYED EACHOTHERS COMPANY.AFTER A LITTLE RAMBLING TALK THE LAWYER LED UP TO THE SUBJECT WHICH SODISAGREEABLY PREOCCUPIED HIS MIND.I SUPPOSE LANYON SAID HE YOU AND I MUST BE THE TWO OLDEST FRIENDSTHAT HENRY JEKYLL HASI WISH THE FRIENDS WERE YOUNGER CHUCKLED DR. LANYON. BUT I SUPPOSEWE ARE. AND WHAT OF THAT I SEE LITTLE OF HIM NOW.INDEED SAID UTTERSON. I THOUGHT YOU HAD A BOND OF COMMON INTEREST.WE HAD WAS THE REPLY. BUT IT IS MORE THAN TEN YEARS SINCE HENRYJEKYLL BECAME TOO FANCIFUL FOR ME. HE BEGAN TO GO WRONG WRONG IN MINDAND THOUGH OF COURSE I CONTINUE TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN HIM FOR OLDSAKES SAKE AS THEY SAY I SEE AND I HAVE SEEN DEVILISH LITTLE OF THEMAN. SUCH UNSCIENTIFIC BALDERDASH ADDED THE DOCTOR FLUSHING SUDDENLYPURPLE WOULD HAVE ESTRANGED DAMON AND PYTHIAS.THIS LITTLE SPIRIT OF TEMPER WAS SOMEWHAT OF A RELIEF TO MR. UTTERSON.THEY HAVE ONLY DIFFERED ON SOME POINT OF SCIENCE HE THOUGHT ANDBEING A MAN OF NO SCIENTIFIC PASSIONS EXCEPT IN THE MATTER OFCONVEYANCING HE EVEN ADDED IT IS NOTHING WORSE THAN THAT HE GAVEHIS FRIEND A FEW SECONDS TO RECOVER HIS COMPOSURE AND THEN APPROACHEDTHE QUESTION HE HAD COME TO PUT. DID YOU EVER COME ACROSS A PROTGOF HISONE HYDE HE ASKED.HYDE REPEATED LANYON. NO. NEVER HEARD OF HIM. SINCE MY TIME.THAT WAS THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT THE LAWYER CARRIED BACK WITHHIM TO THE GREAT DARK BED ON WHICH HE TOSSED TO AND FRO UNTIL THESMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING BEGAN TO GROW LARGE. IT WAS A NIGHT OFLITTLE EASE TO HIS TOILING MIND TOILING IN MERE DARKNESS AND BESIEGEDBY QUESTIONS.SIX OCLOCK STRUCK ON THE BELLS OF THE CHURCH THAT WAS SO CONVENIENTLYNEAR TO MR. UTTERSONS DWELLING AND STILL HE WAS DIGGING AT THEPROBLEM. HITHERTO IT HAD TOUCHED HIM ON THE INTELLECTUAL SIDE ALONEBUT NOW HIS IMAGINATION ALSO WAS ENGAGED OR RATHER ENSLAVED AND AS HELAY AND TOSSED IN THE GROSS DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT AND THE CURTAINEDROOM MR. ENFIELDS TALE WENT BY BEFORE HIS MIND IN A SCROLL OF LIGHTEDPICTURES. HE WOULD BE AWARE OF THE GREAT FIELD OF LAMPS OF A NOCTURNALCITY THEN OF THE FIGURE OF A MAN WALKING SWIFTLY THEN OF A CHILDRUNNING FROM THE DOCTORS AND THEN THESE MET AND THAT HUMANJUGGERNAUT TROD THE CHILD DOWN AND PASSED ON REGARDLESS OF HER SCREAMS.OR ELSE HE WOULD SEE A ROOM IN A RICH HOUSE WHERE HIS FRIEND LAYASLEEP DREAMING AND SMILING AT HIS DREAMS AND THEN THE DOOR OF THATROOM WOULD BE OPENED THE CURTAINS OF THE BED PLUCKED APART THESLEEPER RECALLED AND LO THERE WOULD STAND BY HIS SIDE A FIGURE TOWHOM POWER WAS GIVEN AND EVEN AT THAT DEAD HOUR HE MUST RISE AND DOITS BIDDING. THE FIGURE IN THESE TWO PHASES HAUNTED THE LAWYER ALLNIGHT AND IF AT ANY TIME HE DOZED OVER IT WAS BUT TO SEE IT GLIDEMORE STEALTHILY THROUGH SLEEPING HOUSES OR MOVE THE MORE SWIFTLY ANDSTILL THE MORE SWIFTLY EVEN TO DIZZINESS THROUGH WIDER LABYRINTHS OFLAMPLIGHTED CITY AND AT EVERY STREET CORNER CRUSH A CHILD AND LEAVEHER SCREAMING. AND STILL THE FIGURE HAD NO FACE BY WHICH HE MIGHT KNOWIT EVEN IN HIS DREAMS IT HAD NO FACE OR ONE THAT BAFFLED HIM ANDMELTED BEFORE HIS EYES AND THUS IT WAS THAT THERE SPRANG UP AND GREWAPACE IN THE LAWYERS MIND A SINGULARLY STRONG ALMOST AN INORDINATECURIOSITY TO BEHOLD THE FEATURES OF THE REAL MR. HYDE. IF HE COULD BUTONCE SET EYES ON HIM HE THOUGHT THE MYSTERY WOULD LIGHTEN AND PERHAPSROLL ALTOGETHER AWAY AS WAS THE HABIT OF MYSTERIOUS THINGS WHEN WELLEXAMINED. HE MIGHT SEE A REASON FOR HIS FRIENDS STRANGE PREFERENCE ORBONDAGE CALL IT WHICH YOU PLEASE AND EVEN FOR THE STARTLING CLAUSE OFTHE WILL. AT LEAST IT WOULD BE A FACE WORTH SEEING THE FACE OF A MANWHO WAS WITHOUT BOWELS OF MERCY A FACE WHICH HAD BUT TO SHOW ITSELF TORAISE UP IN THE MIND OF THE UNIMPRESSIONABLE ENFIELD A SPIRIT OFENDURING HATRED.FROM THAT TIME FORWARD MR. UTTERSON BEGAN TO HAUNT THE DOOR IN THEBYSTREET OF SHOPS. IN THE MORNING BEFORE OFFICE HOURS AT NOON WHENBUSINESS WAS PLENTY AND TIME SCARCE AT NIGHT UNDER THE FACE OF THEFOGGED CITY MOON BY ALL LIGHTS AND AT ALL HOURS OF SOLITUDE ORCONCOURSE THE LAWYER WAS TO BE FOUND ON HIS CHOSEN POST.IF HE BE MR. HYDE HE HAD THOUGHT I SHALL BE MR. SEEK.AND AT LAST HIS PATIENCE WAS REWARDED. IT WAS A FINE DRY NIGHT FROSTIN THE AIR THE STREETS AS CLEAN AS A BALLROOM FLOOR THE LAMPSUNSHAKEN BY ANY WIND DRAWING A REGULAR PATTERN OF LIGHT AND SHADOW. BYTEN OCLOCK WHEN THE SHOPS WERE CLOSED THE BYSTREET WAS VERYSOLITARY AND IN SPITE OF THE LOW GROWL OF LONDON FROM ALL ROUND VERYSILENT. SMALL SOUNDS CARRIED FAR DOMESTIC SOUNDS OUT OF THE HOUSESWERE CLEARLY AUDIBLE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROADWAY AND THE RUMOUR OFTHE APPROACH OF ANY PASSENGER PRECEDED HIM BY A LONG TIME. MR. UTTERSONHAD BEEN SOME MINUTES AT HIS POST WHEN HE WAS AWARE OF AN ODD LIGHTFOOTSTEP DRAWING NEAR. IN THE COURSE OF HIS NIGHTLY PATROLS HE HADLONG GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO THE QUAINT EFFECT WITH WHICH THE FOOTFALLS OFA SINGLE PERSON WHILE HE IS STILL A GREAT WAY OFF SUDDENLY SPRING OUTDISTINCT FROM THE VAST HUM AND CLATTER OF THE CITY. YET HIS ATTENTIONHAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN SO SHARPLY AND DECISIVELY ARRESTED AND IT WASWITH A STRONG SUPERSTITIOUS PREVISION OF SUCCESS THAT HE WITHDREW INTOTHE ENTRY OF THE COURT.THE STEPS DREW SWIFTLY NEARER AND SWELLED OUT SUDDENLY LOUDER AS THEYTURNED THE END OF THE STREET. THE LAWYER LOOKING FORTH FROM THE ENTRYCOULD SOON SEE WHAT MANNER OF MAN HE HAD TO DEAL WITH. HE WAS SMALL ANDVERY PLAINLY DRESSED AND THE LOOK OF HIM EVEN AT THAT DISTANCE WENTSOMEHOW STRONGLY AGAINST THE WATCHERS INCLINATION. BUT HE MADESTRAIGHT FOR THE DOOR CROSSING THE ROADWAY TO SAVE TIME AND AS HECAME HE DREW A KEY FROM HIS POCKET LIKE ONE APPROACHING HOME.MR. UTTERSON STEPPED OUT AND TOUCHED HIM ON THE SHOULDER AS HE PASSED.MR. HYDE I THINKMR. HYDE SHRANK BACK WITH A HISSING INTAKE OF THE BREATH. BUT HIS FEARWAS ONLY MOMENTARY AND THOUGH HE DID NOT LOOK THE LAWYER IN THE FACEHE ANSWERED COOLLY ENOUGH THAT IS MY NAME. WHAT DO YOU WANTI SEE YOU ARE GOING IN RETURNED THE LAWYER. I AM AN OLD FRIEND OFDR. JEKYLLSMR. UTTERSON OF GAUNT STREETYOU MUST HAVE HEARD OF MYNAME AND MEETING YOU SO CONVENIENTLY I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT ADMIT ME.YOU WILL NOT FIND DR. JEKYLL HE IS FROM HOME REPLIED MR. HYDEBLOWING IN THE KEY. AND THEN SUDDENLY BUT STILL WITHOUT LOOKING UPHOW DID YOU KNOW ME HE ASKED.ON YOUR SIDE SAID MR. UTTERSON WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOURWITH PLEASURE REPLIED THE OTHER. WHAT SHALL IT BEWILL YOU LET ME SEE YOUR FACE ASKED THE LAWYER.MR. HYDE APPEARED TO HESITATE AND THEN AS IF UPON SOME SUDDENREFLECTION FRONTED ABOUT WITH AN AIR OF DEFIANCE AND THE PAIR STAREDAT EACH OTHER PRETTY FIXEDLY FOR A FEW SECONDS. NOW I SHALL KNOW YOUAGAIN SAID MR. UTTERSON. IT MAY BE USEFUL.YES RETURNED MR. HYDE IT IS AS WELL WE HAVE MET AND  PROPOSYOU SHOULD HAVE MY ADDRESS. AND HE GAVE A NUMBER OF A STREET IN SOHO.GOOD GOD THOUGHT MR. UTTERSON CAN HE TOO HAVE BEEN THINKING OFTHE WILL BUT HE KEPT HIS FEELINGS TO HIMSELF AND ONLY GRUNTED INACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE ADDRESS.AND NOW SAID THE OTHER HOW DID YOU KNOW MEBY DESCRIPTION WAS THE REPLY.WHOSE DESCRIPTIONWE HAVE COMMON FRIENDS SAID MR. UTTERSON.COMMON FRIENDS ECHOED MR. HYDE A LITTLE HOARSELY. WHO ARE THEYJEKYLL FOR INSTANCE SAID THE LAWYER.HE NEVER TOLD YOU CRIED MR. HYDE WITH A FLUSH OF ANGER. I DID NOTTHINK YOU WOULD HAVE LIED.COME SAID MR. UTTERSON THAT IS NOT FITTING LANGUAGE.THE OTHER SNARLED ALOUD INTO A SAVAGE LAUGH AND THE NEXT MOMENT WITHEXTRAORDINARY QUICKNESS HE HAD UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND DISAPPEARED INTOTHE HOUSE.THE LAWYER STOOD AWHILE WHEN MR. HYDE HAD LEFT HIM THE PICTURE OFDISQUIETUDE. THEN HE BEGAN SLOWLY TO MOUNT THE STREET PAUSING EVERYSTEP OR TWO AND PUTTING HIS HAND TO HIS BROW LIKE A MAN IN MENTALPERPLEXITY. THE PROBLEM HE WAS THUS DEBATING AS HE WALKED WAS ONE OF ACLASS THAT IS RARELY SOLVED. MR. HYDE WAS PALE AND DWARFISH HE GAVE ANIMPRESSION OF DEFORMITY WITHOUT ANY NAMEABLE MALFORMATION HE HAD ADISPLEASING SMILE HE HAD BORNE HIMSELF TO THE LAWYER WITH A SORT OFMURDEROUS MIXTURE OF TIMIDITY AND BOLDNESS AND HE SPOKE WITH A HUSKYWHISPERING AND SOMEWHAT BROKEN VOICE ALL THESE WERE POINTS AGAINSTHIM BUT NOT ALL OF THESE TOGETHER COULD EXPLAIN THE HITHERTO UNKNOWNDISGUST LOATHING AND FEAR WITH WHICH MR. UTTERSON REGARDED HIM. THEREMUST BE SOMETHING ELSE SAID THE PERPLEXED GENTLEMAN. THERE ISSOMETHING MORE IF I COULD FIND A NAME FOR IT. GOD BLESS ME THE MANSEEMS HARDLY HUMAN SOMETHING TROGLODYTIC SHALL WE SAY OR CAN IT BETHE OLD STORY OF DR. FELL OR IS IT THE MERE RADIANCE OF A FOUL SOULTHAT THUS TRANSPIRES THROUGH AND TRANSFIGURES ITS CLAY CONTINENT THELAST I THINK FOR O MY POOR OLD HARRY JEKYLL IF EVER I READ SATANSSIGNATURE UPON A FACE IT IS ON THAT OF YOUR NEW FRIEND.ROUND THE CORNER FROM THE BYSTREET THERE WAS A SQUARE OF ANCIENTHANDSOME HOUSES NOW FOR THE MOST PART DECAYED FROM THEIR HIGH ESTATEAND LET IN FLATS AND CHAMBERS TO ALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS OF MENMAPENGRAVERS ARCHITECTS SHADY LAWYERS AND THE AGENTS OF OBSCUREENTERPRISES. ONE HOUSE HOWEVER SECOND FROM THE CORNER WAS STILLOCCUPIED ENTIRE AND AT THE DOOR OF THIS WHICH WORE A GREAT AIR OFWEALTH AND COMFORT THOUGH IT WAS NOW PLUNGED IN DARKNESS EXCEPT FORTHE FANLIGHT MR. UTTERSON STOPPED AND KNOCKED. A WELLDRESSED ELDERLYSERVANT OPENED THE DOOR.IS DR. JEKYLL AT HOME POOLE ASKED THE LAWYER.I WILL SEE MR. UTTERSON SAID POOLE ADMITTING THE VISITOR AS HESPOKE INTO A LARGE LOWROOFED COMFORTABLE HALL PAVED WITH FLAGSWARMED AFTER THE FASHION OF A COUNTRY HOUSE BY A BRIGHT OPEN FIREAND FURNISHED WITH COSTLY CABINETS OF OAK. WILL YOU WAIT HERE BY THEFIRE SIR OR SHALL I GIVE YOU A LIGHT IN THE DININGROOMHERE THANK YOU SAID THE LAWYER AND HE DREW NEAR AND LEANED ON THETALL FENDER. THIS HALL IN WHICH HE WAS NOW LEFT ALONE WAS A PET FANCYOF HIS FRIEND THE DOCTORS AND UTTERSON HIMSELF WAS WONT TO SPEAK OFIT AS THE PLEASANTEST ROOM IN LONDON. BUT TONIGHT THERE WAS A SHUDDERIN HIS BLOOD THE FACE OF HYDE SAT HEAVY ON HIS MEMORY HE FELT WHATWAS RARE WITH HIM A NAUSEA AND DISTASTE OF LIFE AND IN THE GLOOM OFHIS SPIRITS HE SEEMED TO READ A MENACE IN THE FLICKERING OF THEFIRELIGHT ON THE POLISHED CABINETS AND THE UNEASY STARTING OF THESHADOW ON THE ROOF. HE WAS ASHAMED OF HIS RELIEF WHEN POOLE PRESENTLYRETURNED TO ANNOUNCE THAT DR. JEKYLL WAS GONE OUT.I SAW MR. HYDE GO IN BY THE OLD DISSECTING ROOM POOLE HE SAID. ISTHAT RIGHT WHEN DR. JEKYLL IS FROM HOMEQUITE RIGHT MR. UTTERSON SIR REPLIED THE SERVANT. MR. HYDE HAS AKEY.YOUR MASTER SEEMS TO REPOSE A GREAT DEAL OF TRUST IN THAT YOUNG MANPOOLE RESUMED THE OTHER MUSINGLY.YES SIR HE DOES INDEED SAID POOLE. WE HAVE ALL ORDERS TO OBEYHIM.I DO NOT THINK I EVER MET MR. HYDE ASKED UTTERSON.O DEAR NO SIR. HE NEVER DINES HERE REPLIED THE BUTLER. INDEEDWE SEE VERY LITTLE OF HIM ON THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE HE MOSTLY COMESAND GOES BY THE LABORATORY.WELL GOODNIGHT POOLE.GOODNIGHT MR. UTTERSON.AND THE LAWYER SET OUT HOMEWARD WITH A VERY HEAVY HEART. POOR HARRYJEKYLL HE THOUGHT MY MIND MISGIVES ME HE IS IN DEEP WATERS HE WASWILD WHEN HE WAS YOUNG A LONG WHILE AGO TO BE SURE BUT IN THE LAW OFGOD THERE IS NO STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. AY IT MUST BE THAT THE GHOSTOF SOME OLD SIN THE CANCER OF SOME CONCEALED DISGRACE PUNISHMENTCOMING PEDE CLAUDO YEARS AFTER MEMORY HAS FORGOTTEN AND SELFLOVECONDONED THE FAULT. AND THE LAWYER SCARED BY THE THOUGHT BROODEDAWHILE ON HIS OWN PAST GROPING IN ALL THE CORNERS OF MEMORY LEAST BYCHANCE SOME JACKINTHEBOX OF AN OLD INIQUITY SHOULD LEAP TO LIGHTTHERE. HIS PAST WAS FAIRLY BLAMELESS FEW MEN COULD READ THE ROLLS OFTHEIR LIFE WITH LESS APPREHENSION YET HE WAS HUMBLED TO THE DUST BYTHE MANY ILL THINGS HE HAD DONE AND RAISED UP AGAIN INTO A SOBER ANDFEARFUL GRATITUDE BY THE MANY HE HAD COME SO NEAR TO DOING YET AVOIDED.AND THEN BY A RETURN ON HIS FORMER SUBJECT HE CONCEIVED A SPARK OFHOPE. THIS MASTER HYDE IF HE WERE STUDIED THOUGHT HE MUST HAVESECRETS OF HIS OWN BLACK SECRETS BY THE LOOK OF HIM SECRETS COMPAREDTO WHICH POOR JEKYLLS WORST WOULD BE LIKE SUNSHINE. THINGS CANNOTCONTINUE AS THEY ARE. IT TURNS ME COLD TO THINK OF THIS CREATURESTEALING LIKE A THIEF TO HARRYS BEDSIDE POOR HARRY WHAT A WAKENINGAND THE DANGER OF IT FOR IF THIS HYDE SUSPECTS THE EXISTENCE OF THEWILL HE MAY GROW IMPATIENT TO INHERIT. AY I MUST PUT MY SHOULDERS TOTHE WHEELIF JEKYLL WILL BUT LET ME HE ADDED IF JEKYLL WILL ONLYLET ME. FOR ONCE MORE HE SAW BEFORE HIS MINDS EYE AS CLEAR ASTRANSPARENCY THE STRANGE CLAUSES OF THE WILL.DR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASEA FORTNIGHT LATER BY EXCELLENT GOOD FORTUNE THE DOCTOR GAVE ONE OFHIS PLEASANT DINNERS TO SOME FIVE OR SIX OLD CRONIES ALL INTELLIGENTREPUTABLE MEN AND ALL JUDGES OF GOOD WINE AND MR. UTTERSON SOCONTRIVED THAT HE REMAINED BEHIND AFTER THE OTHERS HAD DEPARTED. THISWAS NO NEW ARRANGEMENT BUT A THING THAT HAD BEFALLEN MANY SCORES OFTIMES. WHERE UTTERSON WAS LIKED HE WAS LIKED WELL. HOSTS LOVED TODETAIN THE DRY LAWYER WHEN THE LIGHTHEARTED AND LOOSETONGUED HADALREADY THEIR FOOT ON THE THRESHOLD THEY LIKED TO SIT A WHILE IN HISUNOBTRUSIVE COMPANY PRACTISING FOR SOLITUDE SOBERING THEIR MINDS INTHE MANS RICH SILENCE AFTER THE EXPENSE AND STRAIN OF GAIETY. TO THISRULE DR. JEKYLL WAS NO EXCEPTION AND AS HE NOW SAT ON THE OPPOSITESIDE OF THE FIREA LARGE WELLMADE SMOOTHFACED MAN OF FIFTY WITHSOMETHING OF A SLYISH CAST PERHAPS BUT EVERY MARK OF CAPACITY ANDKINDNESSYOU COULD SEE BY HIS LOOKS THAT HE CHERISHED FOR MR. UTTERSONA SINCERE AND WARM AFFECTION.I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO SPEAK TO YOU JEKYLL BEGAN THE LATTER. YOUKNOW THAT WILL OF YOURSA CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE GATHERED THAT THE TOPIC WAS DISTASTEFULBUT THE DOCTOR CARRIED IT OFF GAILY. MY POOR UTTERSON SAID HE YOUARE UNFORTUNATE IN SUCH A CLIENT. I NEVER SAW A MAN SO DISTRESSED ASYOU WERE BY MY WILL UNLESS IT WERE THAT HIDEBOUND PEDANT LANYON ATWHAT HE CALLED MY SCIENTIFIC HERESIES. O I KNOW HES A GOOD FELLOWYOUNEEDNT FROWNAN EXCELLENT FELLOW AND I ALWAYS MEAN TO SEE MORE OFHIM BUT A HIDEBOUND PEDANT FOR ALL THAT AN IGNORANT BLATANT PEDANT.I WAS NEVER MORE DISAPPOINTED IN ANY MAN THAN LANYON.YOU KNOW I NEVER APPROVED OF IT PURSUED UTTERSON RUTHLESSLYDISREGARDING THE FRESH TOPIC.MY WILL YES CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT SAID THE DOCTOR A TRIFLESHARPLY. YOU HAVE TOLD ME SO.WELL I TELL YOU SO AGAIN CONTINUED THE LAWYER. I HAVE BEENLEARNING SOMETHING OF YOUNG HYDE.THE LARGE HANDSOME FACE OF DR. JEKYLL GREW PALE TO THE VERY LIPS ANDTHERE CAME A BLACKNESS ABOUT HIS EYES. I DO NOT CARE TO HEAR MORESAID HE. THIS IS A MATTER I THOUGHT WE HAD AGREED TO DROP.WHAT I HEARD WAS ABOMINABLE SAID UTTERSON.IT CAN MAKE NO CHANGE. YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND MY POSITION RETURNEDTHE DOCTOR WITH A CERTAIN INCOHERENCY OF MANNER. I AM PAINFULLYSITUATED UTTERSON MY POSITION IS A VERY STRANGEA VERY STRANGE ONE.IT IS ONE OF THOSE AFFAIRS THAT CANNOT BE MENDED BY TALKING.JEKYLL SAID UTTERSON YOU KNOW ME I AM A MAN TO BE TRUSTED. MAKE ACLEAN BREAST OF THIS IN CONFIDENCE AND I MAKE NO DOUBT I CAN GET YOUOUT OF IT.MY GOOD UTTERSON SAID THE DOCTOR THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU THIS ISDOWNRIGHT GOOD OF YOU AND I CANNOT FIND WORDS TO THANK YOU IN. IBELIEVE YOU FULLY I WOULD TRUST YOU BEFORE ANY MAN ALIVE AY BEFOREMYSELF IF I COULD MAKE THE CHOICE BUT INDEED IT ISNT WHAT YOU FANCYIT IS NOT AS BAD AS THAT AND JUST TO PUT YOUR GOOD HEART AT REST IWILL TELL YOU ONE THING THE MOMENT I CHOOSE I CAN BE RID OF MR. HYDE.I GIVE YOU MY HAND UPON THAT AND I THANK YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN AND IWILL JUST ADD ONE LITTLE WORD UTTERSON THAT IM SURE YOULL TAKE INGOOD PART THIS IS A PRIVATE MATTER AND I BEG OF YOU TO LET IT SLEEP.UTTERSON REFLECTED A LITTLE LOOKING IN THE FIRE.I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT HE SAID AT LAST GETTING TOHIS FEET.WELL BUT SINCE WE HAVE TOUCHED UPON THIS BUSINESS AND FOR THE LASTTIME I HOPE CONTINUED THE DOCTOR THERE IS ONE POINT I SHOULD LIKEYOU TO UNDERSTAND. I HAVE REALLY A VERY GREAT INTEREST IN POOR HYDE. IKNOW YOU HAVE SEEN HIM HE TOLD ME SO AND I FEAR HE WAS RUDE. BUT I DOSINCERELY TAKE A GREAT A VERY GREAT INTEREST IN THAT YOUNG MAN AND IFI AM TAKEN AWAY UTTERSON I WISH YOU TO PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL BEARWITH HIM AND GET HIS RIGHTS FOR HIM. I THINK YOU WOULD IF YOU KNEWALL AND IT WOULD BE A WEIGHT OFF MY MIND IF YOU WOULD PROMISE.I CANT PRETEND THAT I SHALL EVER LIKE HIM SAID THE LAWYER.I DONT ASK THAT PLEADED JEKYLL LAYING HIS HAND UPON THE OTHERSARM I ONLY ASK FOR JUSTICE I ONLY ASK YOU TO HELP HIM FOR MY SAKEWHEN I AM NO LONGER HERE.UTTERSON HEAVED AN IRREPRESSIBLE SIGH. WELL SAID HE I PROMISE.THE CAREW MURDER CASENEARLY A YEAR LATER IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER  LONDON WAS STARTLEDBY A CRIME OF SINGULAR FEROCITY AND RENDERED ALL THE MORE NOTABLE BYTHE HIGH POSITION OF THE VICTIM. THE DETAILS WERE FEW AND STARTLING. AMAID SERVANT LIVING ALONE IN A HOUSE NOT FAR FROM THE RIVER HAD GONEUPSTAIRS TO BED ABOUT ELEVEN. ALTHOUGH A FOG ROLLED OVER THE CITY INTHE SMALL HOURS THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT WAS CLOUDLESS AND THELANE WHICH THE MAIDS WINDOW OVERLOOKED WAS BRILLIANTLY LIT BY THEFULL MOON. IT SEEMS SHE WAS ROMANTICALLY GIVEN FOR SHE SAT DOWN UPONHER BOX WHICH STOOD IMMEDIATELY UNDER THE WINDOW AND FELL INTO ADREAM OF MUSING. NEVER SHE USED TO SAY WITH STREAMING TEARS WHEN SHENARRATED THAT EXPERIENCE NEVER HAD SHE FELT MORE AT PEACE WITH ALLMEN OR THOUGHT MORE KINDLY OF THE WORLD. AND AS SHE SO SAT SHE BECAMEAWARE OF AN AGED BEAUTIFUL GENTLEMAN WITH WHITE HAIR DRAWING NEARALONG THE LANE AND ADVANCING TO MEET HIM ANOTHER AND VERY SMALLGENTLEMAN TO WHOM AT FIRST SHE PAID LESS ATTENTION. WHEN THEY HAD COMEWITHIN SPEECH WHICH WAS JUST UNDER THE MAIDS EYES THE OLDER MANBOWED AND ACCOSTED THE OTHER WITH A VERY PRETTY MANNER OF POLITENESS.IT DID NOT SEEM AS IF THE SUBJECT OF HIS ADDRESS WERE OF GREATIMPORTANCE INDEED FROM HIS POINTING IT SOMETIMES APPEARED AS IF HEWERE ONLY INQUIRING HIS WAY BUT THE MOON SHONE ON HIS FACE AS HESPOKE AND THE GIRL WAS PLEASED TO WATCH IT IT SEEMED TO BREATHE SUCHAN INNOCENT AND OLDWORLD KINDNESS OF DISPOSITION YET WITH SOMETHINGHIGH TOO AS OF A WELLFOUNDED SELFCONTENT. PRESENTLY HER EYE WANDEREDTO THE OTHER AND SHE WAS SURPRISED TO RECOGNISE IN HIM A CERTAIN MR.HYDE WHO HAD ONCE VISITED HER MASTER AND FOR WHOM SHE HAD CONCEIVED ADISLIKE. HE HAD IN HIS HAND A HEAVY CANE WITH WHICH HE WAS TRIFLINGBUT HE ANSWERED NEVER A WORD AND SEEMED TO LISTEN WITH ANILLCONTAINED IMPATIENCE. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE BROKE OUT IN AGREAT FLAME OF ANGER STAMPING WITH HIS FOOT BRANDISHING THE CANE ANDCARRYING ON AS THE MAID DESCRIBED IT LIKE A MADMAN. THE OLD GENTLEMANTOOK A STEP BACK WITH THE AIR OF ONE VERY MUCH SURPRISED AND A TRIFLEHURT AND AT THAT MR. HYDE BROKE OUT OF ALL BOUNDS AND CLUBBED HIM TOTHE EARTH. AND NEXT MOMENT WITH APELIKE FURY HE WAS TRAMPLING HISVICTIM UNDER FOOT AND HAILING DOWN A STORM OF BLOWS UNDER WHICH THEBONES WERE AUDIBLY SHATTERED AND THE BODY JUMPED UPON THE ROADWAY. ATTHE HORROR OF THESE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS THE MAID FAINTED.IT WAS TWO OCLOCK WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AND CALLED FOR THE POLICE.THE MURDERER WAS GONE LONG AGO BUT THERE LAY HIS VICTIM IN THE MIDDLEOF THE LANE INCREDIBLY MANGLED. THE STICK WITH WHICH THE DEED HAD BEENDONE ALTHOUGH IT WAS OF SOME RARE AND VERY TOUGH AND HEAVY WOOD HADBROKEN IN THE MIDDLE UNDER THE STRESS OF THIS INSENSATE CRUELTY ANDONE SPLINTERED HALF HAD ROLLED IN THE NEIGHBOURING GUTTERTHE OTHERWITHOUT DOUBT HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY BY THE MURDERER.

UTTERSON REFLECTED AND THEN RAISING HIS HEAD IF YOU WILL COMEWITH ME IN MY CAB HE SAID I THINK I CAN TAKE YOU TO HIS HOUSE.IT WAS BY THIS TIME ABOUT NINE IN THE MORNING AND THE FIRST FOG OF THESEASON. A GREAT CHOCOLATECOLOURED PALL LOWERED OVER HEAVEN BUT THEWIND WAS CONTINUALLY CHARGING AND ROUTING THESE EMBATTLED VAPOURS SOTHAT AS THE CAB CRAWLED FROM STREET TO STREET MR. UTTERSON BEHELD AMARVELOUS NUMBER OF DEGREES AND HUES OF TWILIGHT FOR HERE IT WOULD BEDARK LIKE THE BACKEND OF EVENING AND THERE WOULD BE A GLOW OF A RICHLURID BROWN LIKE THE LIGHT OF SOME STRANGE CONFLAGRATION AND HEREFOR A MOMENT THE FOG WOULD BE QUITE BROKEN UP AND A HAGGARD SHAFT OFDAYLIGHT WOULD GLANCE IN BETWEEN THE SWIRLING WREATHS. THE DISMALQUARTER OF SOHO SEEN UNDER THESE CHANGING GLIMPSES WITH ITS MUDDYWAYS AND SLATTERNLY PASSENGERS AND ITS LAMPS WHICH HAD NEVER BEENEXTINGUISHED OR HAD BEEN KINDLED AFRESH TO COMBAT THIS MOURNFULREINVASION OF DARKNESS SEEMED IN THE LAWYERS EYES LIKE A DISTRICTOF SOME CITY IN A NIGHTMARE. THE THOUGHTS OF HIS MIND BESIDES WERE OFTHE GLOOMIEST DYE AND WHEN HE GLANCED AT THE COMPANION OF HIS DRIVEHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF SOME TOUCH OF THAT TERROR OF THE LAW AND THE LAWSOFFICERS WHICH MAY AT TIMES ASSAIL THE MOST HONEST.AS THE CAB DREW UP BEFORE THE ADDRESS INDICATED THE FOG LIFTED ALITTLE AND SHOWED HIM A DINGY STREET A GIN PALACE A LOW FRENCH EATINGHOUSE A SHOP FOR THE RETAIL OF PENNY NUMBERS AND TWOPENNY SALADS MANYRAGGED CHILDREN HUDDLED IN THE DOORWAYS AND MANY WOMEN OF MANYDIFFERENT NATIONALITIES PASSING OUT KEY IN HAND TO HAVE A MORNINGGLASS AND THE NEXT MOMENT THE FOG SETTLED DOWN AGAIN UPON THAT PARTAS BROWN AS UMBER AND CUT HIM OFF FROM HIS BLACKGUARDLY SURROUNDINGS.THIS WAS THE HOME OF HENRY JEKYLLS FAVOURITE OF A MAN WHO WAS HEIR TOA QUARTER OF A MILLION STERLING.AN IVORYFACED AND SILVERYHAIRED OLD WOMAN OPENED THE DOOR. SHE HAD ANEVIL FACE SMOOTHED BY HYPOCRISY BUT HER MANNERS WERE EXCELLENT. YESSHE SAID THIS WAS MR.

HE DONT SEEM A VERYPOPULAR CHARACTER OBSERVED THE LATTER. AND NOW MY GOOD WOMAN JUSTLET ME AND THIS GENTLEMAN HAVE A LOOK ABOUT US.IN THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE HOUSE WHICH BUT FOR THE OLD WOMAN REMAINEDOTHERWISE EMPTY MR. HYDE HAD ONLY USED A COUPLE OF ROOMS BUT THESEWERE FURNISHED WITH LUXURY AND GOOD TASTE. A CLOSET WAS FILLED WITHWINE THE PLATE WAS OF SILVER THE NAPERY ELEGANT A GOOD PICTURE HUNGUPON THE WALLS A GIFT AS UTTERSON SUPPOSED FROM HENRY JEKYLL WHOWAS MUCH OF A CONNOISSEUR AND THE CARPETS WERE OF MANY PLIES ANDAGREEABLE IN COLOUR. AT THIS MOMENT HOWEVER THE ROOMS BORE EVERY MARKOF HAVING BEEN RECENTLY AND HURRIEDLY RANSACKED CLOTHES LAY ABOUT THEFLOOR WITH THEIR POCKETS INSIDE OUT LOCKFAST DRAWERS STOOD OPEN ANDON THE HEARTH THERE LAY A PILE OF GREY ASHES AS THOUGH MANY PAPERS HADBEEN BURNED. FROM THESE EMBERS THE INSPECTOR DISINTERRED THE BUTT ENDOF A GREEN CHEQUE BOOK WHICH HAD RESISTED THE ACTION OF THE FIRE THEOTHER HALF OF THE STICK WAS FOUND BEHIND THE DOOR AND AS THIS CLINCHEDHIS SUSPICIONS THE OFFICER DECLARED HIMSELF DELIGHTED. A VISIT TO THEBANK WHERE SEVERAL THOUSAND POUNDS WERE FOUND TO BE LYING TO THEMURDERERS CREDIT COMPLETED HIS GRATIFICATION.YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT SIR HE TOLD MR. UTTERSON I HAVE HIM IN MYHAND. HE MUST HAVE LOST HIS HEAD OR HE NEVER WOULD HAVE LEFT THE STICKOR ABOVE ALL BURNED THE CHEQUE BOOK. WHY MONEYS LIFE TO THE MAN. WEHAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT WAIT FOR HIM AT THE BANK AND GET OUT THEHANDBILLS.THIS LAST HOWEVER WAS NOT SO EASY OF ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR MR.

THE DOCTOR HAD BOUGHT THE HOUSE FROM THE HEIRS OF ACELEBRATED SURGEON AND HIS OWN TASTES BEING RATHER CHEMICAL THANANATOMICAL HAD CHANGED THE DESTINATION OF THE BLOCK AT THE BOTTOM OFTHE GARDEN. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE LAWYER HAD BEEN RECEIVED INTHAT PART OF HIS FRIENDS QUARTERS AND HE EYED THE DINGY WINDOWLESSSTRUCTURE WITH CURIOSITY AND GAZED ROUND WITH A DISTASTEFUL SENSE OFSTRANGENESS AS HE CROSSED THE THEATRE ONCE CROWDED WITH EAGER STUDENTSAND NOW LYING GAUNT AND SILENT THE TABLES LADEN WITH CHEMICALAPPARATUS THE FLOOR STREWN WITH CRATES AND LITTERED WITH PACKINGSTRAW AND THE LIGHT FALLING DIMLY THROUGH THE FOGGY CUPOLA. AT THEFURTHER END A FLIGHT OF STAIRS MOUNTED TO A DOOR COVERED WITH REDBAIZE AND THROUGH THIS MR. UTTERSON WAS AT LAST RECEIVED INTO THEDOCTORS CABINET. IT WAS A LARGE ROOM FITTED ROUND WITH GLASS PRESSESFURNISHED AMONG OTHER THINGS WITH A CHEVALGLASS AND A BUSINESSTABLE AND LOOKING OUT UPON THE COURT BY THREE DUSTY WINDOWS BARREDWITH IRON. THE FIRE BURNED IN THE GRATE A LAMP WAS SET LIGHTED ON THECHIMNEY SHELF FOR EVEN IN THE HOUSES THE FOG BEGAN TO LIE THICKLY ANDTHERE CLOSE UP TO THE WARMTH SAT DR. JEKYLL LOOKING DEATHLY SICK. HEDID NOT RISE TO MEET HIS VISITOR BUT HELD OUT A COLD HAND AND BADE HIMWELCOME IN A CHANGED VOICE.AND NOW SAID MR. UTTERSON AS SOON AS POOLE HAD LEFT THEM YOU HAVEHEARD THE NEWSTHE DOCTOR SHUDDERED.

I WAS THINKING OF MY OWN CHARACTER WHICH THISHATEFUL BUSINESS HAS RATHER EXPOSED.UTTERSON RUMINATED AWHILE HE WAS SURPRISED AT HIS FRIENDSSELFISHNESS AND YET RELIEVED BY IT. WELL SAID HE AT LAST LET MESEE THE LETTER.THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN AN ODD UPRIGHT HAND AND SIGNED EDWARDHYDE AND IT SIGNIFIED BRIEFLY ENOUGH THAT THE WRITERS BENEFACTORDR. JEKYLL WHOM HE HAD LONG SO UNWORTHILY REPAID FOR A THOUSANDGENEROSITIES NEED LABOUR UNDER NO ALARM FOR HIS SAFETY AS HE HADMEANS OF ESCAPE ON WHICH HE PLACED A SURE DEPENDENCE. THE LAWYER LIKEDTHIS LETTER WELL ENOUGH IT PUT A BETTER COLOUR ON THE INTIMACY THAN HEHAD LOOKED FOR AND HE BLAMED HIMSELF FOR SOME OF HIS PAST SUSPICIONS.HAVE YOU THE ENVELOPE HE ASKED.I BURNED IT REPLIED JEKYLL BEFORE I THOUGHT WHAT I WAS ABOUT.

PLAINLY THELETTER HAD COME BY THE LABORATORY DOOR POSSIBLY INDEED IT HAD BEENWRITTEN IN THE CABINET AND IF THAT WERE SO IT MUST BE DIFFERENTLYJUDGED AND HANDLED WITH THE MORE CAUTION. THE NEWSBOYS AS HE WENTWERE CRYING THEMSELVES HOARSE ALONG THE FOOTWAYS SPECIAL EDITION.SHOCKING MURDER OF AN M.P. THAT WAS THE FUNERAL ORATION OF ONE FRIENDAND CLIENT AND HE COULD NOT HELP A CERTAIN APPREHENSION LEST THE GOODNAME OF ANOTHER SHOULD BE SUCKED DOWN IN THE EDDY OF THE SCANDAL. ITWAS AT LEAST A TICKLISH DECISION THAT HE HAD TO MAKE ANDSELFRELIANT AS HE WAS BY HABIT HE BEGAN TO CHERISH A LONGING FORADVICE. IT WAS NOT TO BE HAD DIRECTLY BUT PERHAPS HE THOUGHT ITMIGHT BE FISHED FOR.PRESENTLY AFTER HE SAT ON ONE SIDE OF HIS OWN HEARTH WITH MR. GUESTHIS HEAD CLERK UPON THE OTHER AND MIDWAY BETWEEN AT A NICELYCALCULATED DISTANCE FROM THE FIRE A BOTTLE OF A PARTICULAR OLD WINETHAT HAD LONG DWELT UNSUNNED IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF HIS HOUSE. THE FOGSTILL SLEPT ON THE WING ABOVE THE DROWNED CITY WHERE THE LAMPSGLIMMERED LIKE CARBUNCLES AND THROUGH THE MUFFLE AND SMOTHER OF THESEFALLEN CLOUDS THE PROCESSION OF THE TOWNS LIFE WAS STILL ROLLING INTHROUGH THE GREAT ARTERIES WITH A SOUND AS OF A MIGHTY WIND. BUT THEROOM WAS GAY WITH FIRELIGHT. IN THE BOTTLE THE ACIDS WERE LONG AGORESOLVED THE IMPERIAL DYE HAD SOFTENED WITH TIME AS THE COLOUR GROWSRICHER IN STAINED WINDOWS AND THE GLOW OF HOT AUTUMN AFTERNOONS ONHILLSIDE VINEYARDS WAS READY TO BE SET FREE AND TO DISPERSE THE FOGSOF LONDON. INSENSIBLY THE LAWYER MELTED. THERE WAS NO MAN FROM WHOM HEKEPT FEWER SECRETS THAN MR. GUEST AND HE WAS NOT ALWAYS SURE THAT HEKEPT AS MANY AS HE MEANT. GUEST HAD OFTEN BEEN ON BUSINESS TO THEDOCTORS HE KNEW POOLE HE COULD SCARCE HAVE FAILED TO HEAR OF MR.HYDES FAMILIARITY ABOUT THE HOUSE HE MIGHT DRAW CONCLUSIONS WAS ITNOT AS WELL THEN THAT HE SHOULD SEE A LETTER WHICH PUT THAT MYSTERYTO RIGHT AND ABOVE ALL SINCE GUEST BEING A GREAT STUDENT AND CRITICOF HANDWRITING WOULD CONSIDER THE STEP NATURAL AND OBLIGING THECLERK BESIDES WAS A MAN OF COUNSEL HE COULD SCARCE READ SO STRANGE ADOCUMENT WITHOUT DROPPING A REMARK AND BY THAT REMARK MR. UTTERSONMIGHT SHAPE HIS FUTURE COURSE.THIS IS A SAD BUSINESS ABOUT SIR DANVERS HE SAID.YES SIR INDEED. IT HAS ELICITED A GREAT DEAL OF PUBLIC FEELINGRETURNED GUEST. THE MAN OF COURSE WAS MAD.I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR VIEWS ON THAT REPLIED UTTERSON. I HAVE ADOCUMENT HERE IN HIS HANDWRITING IT IS BETWEEN OURSELVES FOR I SCARCEKNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT IT IS AN UGLY BUSINESS AT THE BEST. BUT THEREIT IS QUITE IN YOUR WAY A MURDERERS AUTOGRAPH.GUESTS EYES BRIGHTENED AND HE SAT DOWN AT ONCE AND STUDIED IT WITHPASSION. NO SIR HE SAID NOT MAD BUT IT IS AN ODD HAND.AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS A VERY ODD WRITER ADDED THE LAWYER.JUST THEN THE SERVANT ENTERED WITH A NOTE.IS THAT FROM DR. JEKYLL SIR INQUIRED THE CLERK. I THOUGHT I KNEWTHE WRITING. ANYTHING PRIVATE MR. UTTERSONONLY AN INVITATION TO DINNER. WHY DO YOU WANT TO SEE ITONE MOMENT. I THANK YOU SIR AND THE CLERK LAID THE TWO SHEETS OFPAPER ALONGSIDE AND SEDULOUSLY COMPARED THEIR CONTENTS. THANK YOUSIR HE SAID AT LAST RETURNING BOTH ITS A VERY INTERESTINGAUTOGRAPH.THERE WAS A PAUSE DURING WHICH MR. UTTERSON STRUGGLED WITH HIMSELF.WHY DID YOU COMPARE THEM GUEST HE INQUIRED SUDDENLY.WELL SIR RETURNED THE CLERK THERES A RATHER SINGULARRESEMBLANCE THE TWO HANDS ARE IN MANY POINTS IDENTICAL ONLYDIFFERENTLY SLOPED.RATHER QUAINT SAID UTTERSON.IT IS AS YOU SAY RATHER QUAINT RETURNED GUEST.I WOULDNT SPEAK OF THIS NOTE YOU KNOW SAID THE MASTER.NO SIR SAID THE CLERK. I UNDERSTAND.BUT NO SOONER WAS MR. UTTERSON ALONE THAT NIGHT THAN HE LOCKED THENOTE INTO HIS SAFE WHERE IT REPOSED FROM THAT TIME FORWARD. WHAT HETHOUGHT. HENRY JEKYLL FORGE FOR A MURDERER AND HIS BLOOD RAN COLD INHIS VEINS.INCIDENT OF DR. LANYONTIME RAN ON THOUSANDS OF POUNDS WERE OFFERED IN REWARD FOR THE DEATHOF SIR DANVERS WAS RESENTED AS A PUBLIC INJURY BUT MR. HYDE HADDISAPPEARED OUT OF THE KEN OF THE POLICE AS THOUGH HE HAD NEVEREXISTED. MUCH OF HIS PAST WAS UNEARTHED INDEED AND ALL DISREPUTABLETALES CAME OUT OF THE MANS CRUELTY AT ONCE SO CALLOUS AND VIOLENT OFHIS VILE LIFE OF HIS STRANGE ASSOCIATES OF THE HATRED THAT SEEMED TOHAVE SURROUNDED HIS CAREER BUT OF HIS PRESENT WHEREABOUTS NOT AWHISPER. FROM THE TIME HE HAD LEFT THE HOUSE IN SOHO ON THE MORNING OFTHE MURDER HE WAS SIMPLY BLOTTED OUT AND GRADUALLY AS TIME DREW ONMR. UTTERSON BEGAN TO RECOVER FROM THE HOTNESS OF HIS ALARM AND TOGROW MORE AT QUIET WITH HIMSELF. THE DEATH OF SIR DANVERS WAS TO HISWAY OF THINKING MORE THAN PAID FOR BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MR. HYDE.NOW THAT THAT EVIL INFLUENCE HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN A NEW LIFE BEGAN FORDR. JEKYLL. HE CAME OUT OF HIS SECLUSION RENEWED RELATIONS WITH HISFRIENDS BECAME ONCE MORE THEIR FAMILIAR GUEST AND ENTERTAINER ANDWHILST HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN KNOWN FOR CHARITIES HE WAS NOW NO LESSDISTINGUISHED FOR RELIGION. HE WAS BUSY HE WAS MUCH IN THE OPEN AIRHE DID GOOD HIS FACE SEEMED TO OPEN AND BRIGHTEN AS IF WITH AN INWARDCONSCIOUSNESS OF SERVICE AND FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS THE DOCTOR WASAT PEACE.ON THE TH OF JANUARY UTTERSON HAD DINED AT THE DOCTORS WITH A SMALLPARTY LANYON HAD BEEN THERE AND THE FACE OF THE HOST HAD LOOKED FROMONE TO THE OTHER AS IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN THE TRIO WERE INSEPARABLEFRIENDS. ON THE TH AND AGAIN ON THE TH THE DOOR WAS SHUT AGAINSTTHE LAWYER. THE DOCTOR WAS CONFINED TO THE HOUSE POOLE SAID ANDSAW NO ONE. ON THE TH HE TRIED AGAIN AND WAS AGAIN REFUSED ANDHAVING NOW BEEN USED FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS TO SEE HIS FRIEND ALMOSTDAILY HE FOUND THIS RETURN OF SOLITUDE TO WEIGH UPON HIS SPIRITS. THEFIFTH NIGHT HE HAD IN GUEST TO DINE WITH HIM AND THE SIXTH HE BETOOKHIMSELF TO DR. LANYONS.THERE AT LEAST HE WAS NOT DENIED ADMITTANCE BUT WHEN HE CAME IN HEWAS SHOCKED AT THE CHANGE WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE DOCTORSAPPEARANCE. HE HAD HIS DEATHWARRANT WRITTEN LEGIBLY UPON HIS FACE. THEROSY MAN HAD GROWN PALE HIS FLESH HAD FALLEN AWAY HE WAS VISIBLYBALDER AND OLDER AND YET IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THESE TOKENS OF A SWIFTPHYSICAL DECAY THAT ARRESTED THE LAWYERS NOTICE AS A LOOK IN THE EYEAND QUALITY OF MANNER THAT SEEMED TO TESTIFY TO SOME DEEPSEATED TERROROF THE MIND. IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT THE DOCTOR SHOULD FEAR DEATH AND YETTHAT WAS WHAT UTTERSON WAS TEMPTED TO SUSPECT. YES HE THOUGHT HEIS A DOCTOR HE MUST KNOW HIS OWN STATE AND THAT HIS DAYS ARE COUNTEDAND THE KNOWLEDGE IS MORE THAN HE CAN BEAR. AND YET WHEN UTTERSONREMARKED ON HIS ILL LOOKS IT WAS WITH AN AIR OF GREAT FIRMNESS THATLANYON DECLARED HIMSELF A DOOMED MAN.I HAVE HAD A SHOCK HE SAID AND I SHALL NEVER RECOVER. IT IS AQUESTION OF WEEKS. WELL LIFE HAS BEEN PLEASANT I LIKED IT YES SIRI USED TO LIKE IT. I SOMETIMES THINK IF WE KNEW ALL WE SHOULD BE MOREGLAD TO GET AWAY.JEKYLL IS ILL TOO OBSERVED UTTERSON. HAVE YOU SEEN HIMBUT LANYONS FACE CHANGED AND HE HELD UP A TREMBLING HAND. I WISH TOSEE OR HEAR NO MORE OF DR. JEKYLL HE SAID IN A LOUD UNSTEADY VOICE.I AM QUITE DONE WITH THAT PERSON AND I BEG THAT YOU WILL SPARE ME ANYALLUSION TO ONE WHOM I REGARD AS DEAD.TUT TUT SAID MR. UTTERSON AND THEN AFTER A CONSIDERABLE PAUSECANT I DO ANYTHING HE INQUIRED. WE ARE THREE VERY OLD FRIENDSLANYON WE SHALL NOT LIVE TO MAKE OTHERS.NOTHING CAN BE DONE RETURNED LANYON ASK HIMSELF.HE WILL NOT SEE ME SAID THE LAWYER.I AM NOT SURPRISED AT THAT WAS THE REPLY. SOME DAY UTTERSON AFTERI AM DEAD YOU MAY PERHAPS COME TO LEARN THE RIGHT AND WRONG OF THIS. ICANNOT TELL YOU. AND IN THE MEANTIME IF YOU CAN SIT AND TALK WITH MEOF OTHER THINGS FOR GODS SAKE STAY AND DO SO BUT IF YOU CANNOT KEEPCLEAR OF THIS ACCURSED TOPIC THEN IN GODS NAME GO FOR I CANNOT BEARIT.AS SOON AS HE GOT HOME UTTERSON SAT DOWN AND WROTE TO JEKYLLCOMPLAINING OF HIS EXCLUSION FROM THE HOUSE AND ASKING THE CAUSE OFTHIS UNHAPPY BREAK WITH LANYON AND THE NEXT DAY BROUGHT HIM A LONGANSWER OFTEN VERY PATHETICALLY WORDED AND SOMETIMES DARKLY MYSTERIOUSIN DRIFT. THE QUARREL WITH LANYON WAS INCURABLE. I DO NOT BLAME OUROLD FRIEND JEKYLL WROTE BUT I SHARE HIS VIEW THAT WE MUST NEVERMEET. I MEAN FROM HENCEFORTH TO LEAD A LIFE OF EXTREME SECLUSION YOUMUST NOT BE SURPRISED NOR MUST YOU DOUBT MY FRIENDSHIP IF MY DOOR ISOFTEN SHUT EVEN TO YOU. YOU MUST SUFFER ME TO GO MY OWN DARK WAY. IHAVE BROUGHT ON MYSELF A PUNISHMENT AND A DANGER THAT I CANNOT NAME. IFI AM THE CHIEF OF SINNERS I AM THE CHIEF OF SUFFERERS ALSO. I COULDNOT THINK THAT THIS EARTH CONTAINED A PLACE FOR SUFFERINGS AND TERRORSSO UNMANNING AND YOU CAN DO BUT ONE THING UTTERSON TO LIGHTEN THISDESTINY AND THAT IS TO RESPECT MY SILENCE. UTTERSON WAS AMAZED THEDARK INFLUENCE OF HYDE HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN THE DOCTOR HAD RETURNED TOHIS OLD TASKS AND AMITIES A WEEK AGO THE PROSPECT HAD SMILED WITHEVERY PROMISE OF A CHEERFUL AND AN HONOURED AGE AND NOW IN A MOMENTFRIENDSHIP AND PEACE OF MIND AND THE WHOLE TENOR OF HIS LIFE WEREWRECKED. SO GREAT AND UNPREPARED A CHANGE POINTED TO MADNESS BUT INVIEW OF LANYONS MANNER AND WORDS THERE MUST LIE FOR IT SOME DEEPERGROUND.A WEEK AFTERWARDS DR. LANYON TOOK TO HIS BED AND IN SOMETHING LESSTHAN A FORTNIGHT HE WAS DEAD. THE NIGHT AFTER THE FUNERAL AT WHICH HEHAD BEEN SADLY AFFECTED UTTERSON LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS BUSINESS ROOMAND SITTING THERE BY THE LIGHT OF A MELANCHOLY CANDLE DREW OUT AND SETBEFORE HIM AN ENVELOPE ADDRESSED BY THE HAND AND SEALED WITH THE SEALOF HIS DEAD FRIEND. PRIVATE FOR THE HANDS OF G. J. UTTERSON ALONEAND IN CASE OF HIS PREDECEASE TO BE DESTROYED UNREAD SO IT WASEMPHATICALLY SUPERSCRIBED AND THE LAWYER DREADED TO BEHOLD THECONTENTS. I HAVE BURIED ONE FRIEND TODAY HE THOUGHT WHAT IF THISSHOULD COST ME ANOTHER AND THEN HE CONDEMNED THE FEAR AS ADISLOYALTY AND BROKE THE SEAL. WITHIN THERE WAS ANOTHER ENCLOSURELIKEWISE SEALED AND MARKED UPON THE COVER AS NOT TO BE OPENED TILLTHE DEATH OR DISAPPEARANCE OF DR. HENRY JEKYLL. UTTERSON COULD NOTTRUST HIS EYES. YES IT WAS DISAPPEARANCE HERE AGAIN AS IN THE MADWILL WHICH HE HAD LONG AGO RESTORED TO ITS AUTHOR HERE AGAIN WERE THEIDEA OF A DISAPPEARANCE AND THE NAME OF HENRY JEKYLL BRACKETTED. BUT INTHE WILL THAT IDEA HAD SPRUNG FROM THE SINISTER SUGGESTION OF THE MANHYDE IT WAS SET THERE WITH A PURPOSE ALL TOO PLAIN AND HORRIBLE.WRITTEN BY THE HAND OF LANYON WHAT SHOULD IT MEAN A GREAT CURIOSITYCAME ON THE TRUSTEE TO DISREGARD THE PROHIBITION AND DIVE AT ONCE TOTHE BOTTOM OF THESE MYSTERIES BUT PROFESSIONAL HONOUR AND FAITH TO HISDEAD FRIEND WERE STRINGENT OBLIGATIONS AND THE PACKET SLEPT IN THEINMOST CORNER OF HIS PRIVATE SAFE.IT IS ONE THING TO MORTIFY CURIOSITY ANOTHER TO CONQUER IT AND IT MAYBE DOUBTED IF FROM THAT DAY FORTH UTTERSON DESIRED THE SOCIETY OF HISSURVIVING FRIEND WITH THE SAME EAGERNESS. HE THOUGHT OF HIM KINDLY BUTHIS THOUGHTS WERE DISQUIETED AND FEARFUL. HE WENT TO CALL INDEED BUTHE WAS PERHAPS RELIEVED TO BE DENIED ADMITTANCE PERHAPS IN HIS HEARTHE PREFERRED TO SPEAK WITH POOLE UPON THE DOORSTEP AND SURROUNDED BYTHE AIR AND SOUNDS OF THE OPEN CITY RATHER THAN TO BE ADMITTED INTOTHAT HOUSE OF VOLUNTARY BONDAGE AND TO SIT AND SPEAK WITH ITSINSCRUTABLE RECLUSE. POOLE HAD INDEED NO VERY PLEASANT NEWS TOCOMMUNICATE. THE DOCTOR IT APPEARED NOW MORE THAN EVER CONFINEDHIMSELF TO THE CABINET OVER THE LABORATORY WHERE HE WOULD SOMETIMESEVEN SLEEP HE WAS OUT OF SPIRITS HE HAD GROWN VERY SILENT HE DID NOTREAD IT SEEMED AS IF HE HAD SOMETHING ON HIS MIND. UTTERSON BECAME SOUSED TO THE UNVARYING CHARACTER OF THESE REPORTS THAT HE FELL OFFLITTLE BY LITTLE IN THE FREQUENCY OF HIS VISITS.INCIDENT AT THE WINDOWIT CHANCED ON SUNDAY WHEN MR. UTTERSON WAS ON HIS USUAL WALK WITH MR.ENFIELD THAT THEIR WAY LAY ONCE AGAIN THROUGH THE BYSTREET AND THATWHEN THEY CAME IN FRONT OF THE DOOR BOTH STOPPED TO GAZE ON IT.WELL SAID ENFIELD THAT STORYS AT AN END AT LEAST. WE SHALL NEVERSEE MORE OF MR. HYDE.I HOPE NOT SAID UTTERSON. DID I EVER TELL YOU THAT I ONCE SAW HIMAND SHARED YOUR FEELING OF REPULSIONIT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER RETURNED ENFIELD.AND BY THE WAY WHAT AN ASS YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT ME NOT TO KNOW THATTHIS WAS A BACK WAY TO DR. JEKYLLS IT WAS PARTLY YOUR OWN FAULT THATI FOUND IT OUT EVEN WHEN I DID.SO YOU FOUND IT OUT DID YOU SAID UTTERSON. BUT IF THAT BE SO WEMAY STEP INTO THE COURT AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE WINDOWS. TO TELL YOU THETRUTH I AM UNEASY ABOUT POOR JEKYLL AND EVEN OUTSIDE I FEEL AS IFTHE PRESENCE OF A FRIEND MIGHT DO HIM GOOD.THE COURT WAS VERY COOL AND A LITTLE DAMP AND FULL OF PREMATURETWILIGHT ALTHOUGH THE SKY HIGH UP OVERHEAD WAS STILL BRIGHT WITHSUNSET. THE MIDDLE ONE OF THE THREE WINDOWS WAS HALFWAY OPEN ANDSITTING CLOSE BESIDE IT TAKING THE AIR WITH AN INFINITE SADNESS OFMIEN LIKE SOME DISCONSOLATE PRISONER UTTERSON SAW DR. JEKYLL.WHAT JEKYLL HE CRIED. I TRUST YOU ARE BETTER.I AM VERY LOW UTTERSON REPLIED THE DOCTOR DREARILY VERY LOW. ITWILL NOT LAST LONG THANK GOD.YOU STAY TOO MUCH INDOORS SAID THE LAWYER. YOU SHOULD BE OUTWHIPPING UP THE CIRCULATION LIKE MR. ENFIELD AND ME. THIS IS MYCOUSINMR. ENFIELDDR. JEKYLL. COME NOW GET YOUR HAT AND TAKE A QUICKTURN WITH US.YOU ARE VERY GOOD SIGHED THE OTHER. I SHOULD LIKE TO VERY MUCH BUTNO NO NO IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE I DARE NOT. BUT INDEED UTTERSON IAM VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU THIS IS REALLY A GREAT PLEASURE I WOULD ASKYOU AND MR. ENFIELD UP BUT THE PLACE IS REALLY NOT FIT.WHY THEN SAID THE LAWYER GOODNATUREDLY THE BEST THING WE CAN DOIS TO STAY DOWN HERE AND SPEAK WITH YOU FROM WHERE WE ARE.THAT IS JUST WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO VENTURE TO PROPOSE RETURNED THEDOCTOR WITH A SMILE. BUT THE WORDS WERE HARDLY UTTERED BEFORE THESMILE WAS STRUCK OUT OF HIS FACE AND SUCCEEDED BY AN EXPRESSION OF SUCHABJECT TERROR AND DESPAIR AS FROZE THE VERY BLOOD OF THE TWO GENTLEMENBELOW. THEY SAW IT BUT FOR A GLIMPSE FOR THE WINDOW WAS INSTANTLYTHRUST DOWN BUT THAT GLIMPSE HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT AND THEY TURNED ANDLEFT THE COURT WITHOUT A WORD. IN SILENCE TOO THEY TRAVERSED THEBYSTREET AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THEY HAD COME INTO A NEIGHBOURINGTHOROUGHFARE WHERE EVEN UPON A SUNDAY THERE WERE STILL SOME STIRRINGSOF LIFE THAT MR. UTTERSON AT LAST TURNED AND LOOKED AT HIS COMPANION.THEY WERE BOTH PALE AND THERE WAS AN ANSWERING HORROR IN THEIR EYES.GOD FORGIVE US GOD FORGIVE US SAID MR. UTTERSON.BUT MR. ENFIELD ONLY NODDED HIS HEAD VERY SERIOUSLY AND WALKED ON ONCEMORE IN SILENCE.THE LAST NIGHTMR. UTTERSON WAS SITTING BY HIS FIRESIDE ONE EVENING AFTER DINNER WHENHE WAS SURPRISED TO RECEIVE A VISIT FROM POOLE.BLESS ME POOLE WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE HE CRIED AND THEN TAKING ASECOND LOOK AT HIM WHAT AILS YOU HE ADDED IS THE DOCTOR ILLMR.

EVEN NOW HESAT WITH THE GLASS OF WINE UNTASTED ON HIS KNEE AND HIS EYES DIRECTEDTO A CORNER OF THE FLOOR. I CAN BEAR IT NO MORE HE REPEATED.COME SAID THE LAWYER I SEE YOU HAVE SOME GOOD REASON POOLE I SEETHERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY AMISS.

WHAT FOUL PLAY WHAT DOES THEMAN MEANI DARENT SAY SIR WAS THE ANSWER BUT WILL YOU COME ALONG WITH MEAND SEE FOR YOURSELFMR. UTTERSONS ONLY ANSWER WAS TO RISE AND GET HIS HAT AND GREATCOATBUT HE OBSERVED WITH WONDER THE GREATNESS OF THE RELIEF THAT APPEAREDUPON THE BUTLERS FACE AND PERHAPS WITH NO LESS THAT THE WINE WASSTILL UNTASTED WHEN HE SET IT DOWN TO FOLLOW.IT WAS A WILD COLD SEASONABLE NIGHT OF MARCH WITH A PALE MOON LYINGON HER BACK AS THOUGH THE WIND HAD TILTED HER AND FLYING WRACK OF THEMOST DIAPHANOUS AND LAWNY TEXTURE. THE WIND MADE TALKING DIFFICULT ANDFLECKED THE BLOOD INTO THE FACE. IT SEEMED TO HAVE SWEPT THE STREETSUNUSUALLY BARE OF PASSENGERS BESIDES FOR MR. UTTERSON THOUGHT HE HADNEVER SEEN THAT PART OF LONDON SO DESERTED. HE COULD HAVE WISHED ITOTHERWISE NEVER IN HIS LIFE HAD HE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF SO SHARP A WISHTO SEE AND TOUCH HIS FELLOWCREATURES FOR STRUGGLE AS HE MIGHT THEREWAS BORNE IN UPON HIS MIND A CRUSHING ANTICIPATION OF CALAMITY. THESQUARE WHEN THEY GOT THERE WAS FULL OF WIND AND DUST AND THE THINTREES IN THE GARDEN WERE LASHING THEMSELVES ALONG THE RAILING. POOLEWHO HAD KEPT ALL THE WAY A PACE OR TWO AHEAD NOW PULLED UP IN THEMIDDLE OF THE PAVEMENT AND IN SPITE OF THE BITING WEATHER TOOK OFFHIS HAT AND MOPPED HIS BROW WITH A RED POCKETHANDKERCHIEF. BUT FOR ALLTHE HURRY OF HIS COMING THESE WERE NOT THE DEWS OF EXERTION THAT HEWIPED AWAY BUT THE MOISTURE OF SOME STRANGLING ANGUISH FOR HIS FACEWAS WHITE AND HIS VOICE WHEN HE SPOKE HARSH AND BROKEN.WELL SIR HE SAID HERE WE ARE AND GOD GRANT THERE BE NOTHINGWRONG.AMEN POOLE SAID THE LAWYER.THEREUPON THE SERVANT KNOCKED IN A VERY GUARDED MANNER THE DOOR WASOPENED ON THE CHAIN AND A VOICE ASKED FROM WITHIN IS THAT YOUPOOLEITS ALL RIGHT SAID POOLE.

THE WIND WHICH ONLY BROKE IN PUFFS AND DRAUGHTS INTO THATDEEP WELL OF BUILDING TOSSED THE LIGHT OF THE CANDLE TO AND FRO ABOUTTHEIR STEPS UNTIL THEY CAME INTO THE SHELTER OF THE THEATRE WHERETHEY SAT DOWN SILENTLY TO WAIT. LONDON HUMMED SOLEMNLY ALL AROUND BUTNEARER AT HAND THE STILLNESS WAS ONLY BROKEN BY THE SOUNDS OF AFOOTFALL MOVING TO AND FRO ALONG THE CABINET FLOOR.SO IT WILL WALK ALL DAY SIR WHISPERED POOLE AY AND THE BETTERPART OF THE NIGHT.

POOLE DISINTERRED THE AXE FROMUNDER A STACK OF PACKING STRAW THE CANDLE WAS SET UPON THE NEARESTTABLE TO LIGHT THEM TO THE ATTACK AND THEY DREW NEAR WITH BATED BREATHTO WHERE THAT PATIENT FOOT WAS STILL GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN INTHE QUIET OF THE NIGHT.JEKYLL CRIED UTTERSON WITH A LOUD VOICE I DEMAND TO SEE YOU. HEPAUSED A MOMENT BUT THERE CAME NO REPLY. I GIVE YOU FAIR WARNING OURSUSPICIONS ARE AROUSED AND I MUST AND SHALL SEE YOU HE RESUMED IFNOT BY FAIR MEANS THEN BY FOULIF NOT OF YOUR CONSENT THEN BY BRUTEFORCEUTTERSON SAID THE VOICE FOR GODS SAKE HAVE MERCYAH THATS NOT JEKYLLS VOICEITS HYDES CRIED UTTERSON. DOWN WITHTHE DOOR POOLEPOOLE SWUNG THE AXE OVER HIS SHOULDER THE BLOW SHOOK THE BUILDING ANDTHE RED BAIZE DOOR LEAPED AGAINST THE LOCK AND HINGES. A DISMALSCREECH AS OF MERE ANIMAL TERROR RANG FROM THE CABINET. UP WENT THEAXE AGAIN AND AGAIN THE PANELS CRASHED AND THE FRAME BOUNDED FOURTIMES THE BLOW FELL BUT THE WOOD WAS TOUGH AND THE FITTINGS WERE OFEXCELLENT WORKMANSHIP AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE FIFTH THAT THE LOCKBURST AND THE WRECK OF THE DOOR FELL INWARDS ON THE CARPET.THE BESIEGERS APPALLED BY THEIR OWN RIOT AND THE STILLNESS THAT HADSUCCEEDED STOOD BACK A LITTLE AND PEERED IN. THERE LAY THE CABINETBEFORE THEIR EYES IN THE QUIET LAMPLIGHT A GOOD FIRE GLOWING ANDCHATTERING ON THE HEARTH THE KETTLE SINGING ITS THIN STRAIN A DRAWEROR TWO OPEN PAPERS NEATLY SET FORTH ON THE BUSINESS TABLE AND NEARERTHE FIRE THE THINGS LAID OUT FOR TEA THE QUIETEST ROOM YOU WOULDHAVE SAID AND BUT FOR THE GLAZED PRESSES FULL OF CHEMICALS THE MOSTCOMMONPLACE THAT NIGHT IN LONDON.RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE THERE LAY THE BODY OF A MAN SORELY CONTORTED ANDSTILL TWITCHING. THEY DREW NEAR ON TIPTOE TURNED IT ON ITS BACK ANDBEHELD THE FACE OF EDWARD HYDE. HE WAS DRESSED IN CLOTHES FAR TOO LARGEFOR HIM CLOTHES OF THE DOCTORS BIGNESS THE CORDS OF HIS FACE STILLMOVED WITH A SEMBLANCE OF LIFE BUT LIFE WAS QUITE GONE AND BY THECRUSHED PHIAL IN THE HAND AND THE STRONG SMELL OF KERNELS THAT HUNGUPON THE AIR UTTERSON KNEW THAT HE WAS LOOKING ON THE BODY OF ASELFDESTROYER.WE HAVE COME TOO LATE HE SAID STERNLY WHETHER TO SAVE OR PUNISH.HYDE IS GONE TO HIS ACCOUNT AND IT ONLY REMAINS FOR US TO FIND THEBODY OF YOUR MASTER.THE FAR GREATER PROPORTION OF THE BUILDING WAS OCCUPIED BY THE THEATREWHICH FILLED ALMOST THE WHOLE GROUND STOREY AND WAS LIGHTED FROM ABOVEAND BY THE CABINET WHICH FORMED AN UPPER STOREY AT ONE END AND LOOKEDUPON THE COURT. A CORRIDOR JOINED THE THEATRE TO THE DOOR ON THEBYSTREET AND WITH THIS THE CABINET COMMUNICATED SEPARATELY BY ASECOND FLIGHT OF STAIRS. THERE WERE BESIDES A FEW DARK CLOSETS AND ASPACIOUS CELLAR. ALL THESE THEY NOW THOROUGHLY EXAMINED. EACH CLOSETNEEDED BUT A GLANCE FOR ALL WERE EMPTY AND ALL BY THE DUST THAT FELLFROM THEIR DOORS HAD STOOD LONG UNOPENED. THE CELLAR INDEED WASFILLED WITH CRAZY LUMBER MOSTLY DATING FROM THE TIMES OF THE SURGEONWHO WAS JEKYLLS PREDECESSOR BUT EVEN AS THEY OPENED THE DOOR THEYWERE ADVERTISED OF THE USELESSNESS OF FURTHER SEARCH BY THE FALL OF APERFECT MAT OF COBWEB WHICH HAD FOR YEARS SEALED UP THE ENTRANCE.NOWHERE WAS THERE ANY TRACE OF HENRY JEKYLL DEAD OR ALIVE.POOLE STAMPED ON THE FLAGS OF THE CORRIDOR. HE MUST BE BURIED HEREHE SAID HEARKENING TO THE SOUND.OR HE MAY HAVE FLED SAID UTTERSON AND HE TURNED TO EXAMINE THE DOORIN THE BYSTREET. IT WAS LOCKED AND LYING NEAR BY ON THE FLAGS THEYFOUND THE KEY ALREADY STAINED WITH RUST.THIS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE USE OBSERVED THE LAWYER.USE ECHOED POOLE. DO YOU NOT SEE SIR IT IS BROKEN MUCH AS IF AMAN HAD STAMPED ON IT.AY CONTINUED UTTERSON AND THE FRACTURES TOO ARE RUSTY. THE TWOMEN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH A SCARE. THIS IS BEYOND ME POOLE SAIDTHE LAWYER. LET US GO BACK TO THE CABINET.THEY MOUNTED THE STAIR IN SILENCE AND STILL WITH AN OCCASIONALAWESTRUCK GLANCE AT THE DEAD BODY PROCEEDED MORE THOROUGHLY TO EXAMINETHE CONTENTS OF THE CABINET. AT ONE TABLE THERE WERE TRACES OFCHEMICAL WORK VARIOUS MEASURED HEAPS OF SOME WHITE SALT BEING LAID ONGLASS SAUCERS AS THOUGH FOR AN EXPERIMENT IN WHICH THE UNHAPPY MAN HADBEEN PREVENTED.THAT IS THE SAME DRUG THAT I WAS ALWAYS BRINGING HIM SAID POOLE ANDEVEN AS HE SPOKE THE KETTLE WITH A STARTLING NOISE BOILED OVER.THIS BROUGHT THEM TO THE FIRESIDE WHERE THE EASYCHAIR WAS DRAWNCOSILY UP AND THE TEA THINGS STOOD READY TO THE SITTERS ELBOW THEVERY SUGAR IN THE CUP. THERE WERE SEVERAL BOOKS ON A SHELF ONE LAYBESIDE THE TEA THINGS OPEN AND UTTERSON WAS AMAZED TO FIND IT A COPYOF A PIOUS WORK FOR WHICH JEKYLL HAD SEVERAL TIMES EXPRESSED A GREATESTEEM ANNOTATED IN HIS OWN HAND WITH STARTLING BLASPHEMIES.NEXT IN THE COURSE OF THEIR REVIEW OF THE CHAMBER THE SEARCHERS CAMETO THE CHEVALGLASS INTO WHOSE DEPTHS THEY LOOKED WITH AN INVOLUNTARYHORROR. BUT IT WAS SO TURNED AS TO SHOW THEM NOTHING BUT THE ROSY GLOWPLAYING ON THE ROOF THE FIRE SPARKLING IN A HUNDRED REPETITIONS ALONGTHE GLAZED FRONT OF THE PRESSES AND THEIR OWN PALE AND FEARFULCOUNTENANCES STOOPING TO LOOK IN.THIS GLASS HAS SEEN SOME STRANGE THINGS SIR WHISPERED POOLE.AND SURELY NONE STRANGER THAN ITSELF ECHOED THE LAWYER IN THE SAMETONES. FOR WHAT DID JEKYLLHE CAUGHT HIMSELF UP AT THE WORD WITH ASTART AND THEN CONQUERING THE WEAKNESSWHAT COULD JEKYLL WANT WITHIT HE SAID.YOU MAY SAY THAT SAID POOLE.NEXT THEY TURNED TO THE BUSINESS TABLE. ON THE DESK AMONG THE NEATARRAY OF PAPERS A LARGE ENVELOPE WAS UPPERMOST AND BORE IN THEDOCTORS HAND THE NAME OF MR. UTTERSON. THE LAWYER UNSEALED IT ANDSEVERAL ENCLOSURES FELL TO THE FLOOR. THE FIRST WAS A WILL DRAWN INTHE SAME ECCENTRIC TERMS AS THE ONE WHICH HE HAD RETURNED SIX MONTHSBEFORE TO SERVE AS A TESTAMENT IN CASE OF DEATH AND AS A DEED OF GIFTIN CASE OF DISAPPEARANCE BUT IN PLACE OF THE NAME OF EDWARD HYDE THELAWYER WITH INDESCRIBABLE AMAZEMENT READ THE NAME OF GABRIEL JOHNUTTERSON. HE LOOKED AT POOLE AND THEN BACK AT THE PAPER AND LAST OFALL AT THE DEAD MALEFACTOR STRETCHED UPON THE CARPET.MY HEAD GOES ROUND HE SAID. HE HAS BEEN ALL THESE DAYS INPOSSESSION HE HAD NO CAUSE TO LIKE ME HE MUST HAVE RAGED TO SEEHIMSELF DISPLACED AND HE HAS NOT DESTROYED THIS DOCUMENT.HE CAUGHT UP THE NEXT PAPER IT WAS A BRIEF NOTE IN THE DOCTORS HANDAND DATED AT THE TOP. O POOLE THE LAWYER CRIED HE WAS ALIVE ANDHERE THIS DAY. HE CANNOT HAVE BEEN DISPOSED OF IN SO SHORT A SPACE HEMUST BE STILL ALIVE HE MUST HAVE FLED AND THEN WHY FLED AND HOWAND IN THAT CASE CAN WE VENTURE TO DECLARE THIS SUICIDE O WE MUST BECAREFUL. I FORESEE THAT WE MAY YET INVOLVE YOUR MASTER IN SOME DIRECATASTROPHE.WHY DONT YOU READ IT SIR ASKED POOLE.BECAUSE I FEAR REPLIED THE LAWYER SOLEMNLY. GOD GRANT I HAVE NOCAUSE FOR IT AND WITH THAT HE BROUGHT THE PAPER TO HIS EYES AND READAS FOLLOWSMY DEAR UTTERSONWHEN THIS SHALL FALL INTO YOUR HANDS I SHALL HAVEDISAPPEARED UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE NOT THE PENETRATION TOFORESEE BUT MY INSTINCT AND ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY NAMELESSSITUATION TELL ME THAT THE END IS SURE AND MUST BE EARLY. GO THEN ANDFIRST READ THE NARRATIVE WHICH LANYON WARNED ME HE WAS TO PLACE IN YOURHANDS AND IF YOU CARE TO HEAR MORE TURN TO THE CONFESSION OFYOUR UNWORTHY AND UNHAPPY FRIENDHENRY JEKYLL.THERE WAS A THIRD ENCLOSURE ASKED UTTERSON.HERE SIR SAID POOLE AND GAVE INTO HIS HANDS A CONSIDERABLE PACKETSEALED IN SEVERAL PLACES.THE LAWYER PUT IT IN HIS POCKET. I WOULD SAY NOTHING OF THIS PAPER. IFYOUR MASTER HAS FLED OR IS DEAD WE MAY AT LEAST SAVE HIS CREDIT. IT ISNOW TEN I MUST GO HOME AND READ THESE DOCUMENTS IN QUIET BUT I SHALLBE BACK BEFORE MIDNIGHT WHEN WE SHALL SEND FOR THE POLICE.THEY WENT OUT LOCKING THE DOOR OF THE THEATRE BEHIND THEM ANDUTTERSON ONCE MORE LEAVING THE SERVANTS GATHERED ABOUT THE FIRE IN THEHALL TRUDGED BACK TO HIS OFFICE TO READ THE TWO NARRATIVES IN WHICHTHIS MYSTERY WAS NOW TO BE EXPLAINED.DR. LANYONS NARRATIVEON THE NINTH OF JANUARY NOW FOUR DAYS AGO I RECEIVED BY THE EVENINGDELIVERY A REGISTERED ENVELOPE ADDRESSED IN THE HAND OF MY COLLEAGUEAND OLD SCHOOL COMPANION HENRY JEKYLL. I WAS A GOOD DEAL SURPRISED BYTHIS FOR WE WERE BY NO MEANS IN THE HABIT OF CORRESPONDENCE I HADSEEN THE MAN DINED WITH HIM INDEED THE NIGHT BEFORE AND I COULDIMAGINE NOTHING IN OUR INTERCOURSE THAT SHOULD JUSTIFY FORMALITY OFREGISTRATION. THE CONTENTS INCREASED MY WONDER FOR THIS IS HOW THELETTER RANTH DECEMBER .DEAR LANYONYOU ARE ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS AND ALTHOUGH WE MAYHAVE DIFFERED AT TIMES ON SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS I CANNOT REMEMBER ATLEAST ON MY SIDE ANY BREAK IN OUR AFFECTION. THERE WAS NEVER A DAYWHEN IF YOU HAD SAID TO ME JEKYLL MY LIFE MY HONOUR MY REASONDEPEND UPON YOU I WOULD NOT HAVE SACRIFICED MY LEFT HAND TO HELP YOU.LANYON MY LIFE MY HONOUR MY REASON ARE ALL AT YOUR MERCY IF YOUFAIL ME TONIGHT I AM LOST. YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE AFTER THIS PREFACETHAT I AM GOING TO ASK YOU FOR SOMETHING DISHONOURABLE TO GRANT. JUDGEFOR YOURSELF.I WANT YOU TO POSTPONE ALL OTHER ENGAGEMENTS FOR TONIGHTAY EVEN IFYOU WERE SUMMONED TO THE BEDSIDE OF AN EMPEROR TO TAKE A CAB UNLESSYOUR CARRIAGE SHOULD BE ACTUALLY AT THE DOOR AND WITH THIS LETTER INYOUR HAND FOR CONSULTATION TO DRIVE STRAIGHT TO MY HOUSE. POOLE MYBUTLER HAS HIS ORDERS YOU WILL FIND HIM WAITING YOUR ARRIVAL WITH ALOCKSMITH. THE DOOR OF MY CABINET IS THEN TO BE FORCED AND YOU ARE TOGO IN ALONE TO OPEN THE GLAZED PRESS LETTER E ON THE LEFT HANDBREAKING THE LOCK IF IT BE SHUT AND TO DRAW OUT WITH ALL ITSCONTENTS AS THEY STAND THE FOURTH DRAWER FROM THE TOP OR WHICH ISTHE SAME THING THE THIRD FROM THE BOTTOM. IN MY EXTREME DISTRESS OFMIND I HAVE A MORBID FEAR OF MISDIRECTING YOU BUT EVEN IF I AM INERROR YOU MAY KNOW THE RIGHT DRAWER BY ITS CONTENTS SOME POWDERS APHIAL AND A PAPER BOOK. THIS DRAWER I BEG OF YOU TO CARRY BACK WITH YOUTO CAVENDISH SQUARE EXACTLY AS IT STANDS.THAT IS THE FIRST PART OF THE SERVICE NOW FOR THE SECOND. YOU SHOULDBE BACK IF YOU SET OUT AT ONCE ON THE RECEIPT OF THIS LONG BEFOREMIDNIGHT BUT I WILL LEAVE YOU THAT AMOUNT OF MARGIN NOT ONLY IN THEFEAR OF ONE OF THOSE OBSTACLES THAT CAN NEITHER BE PREVENTED NORFORESEEN BUT BECAUSE AN HOUR WHEN YOUR SERVANTS ARE IN BED IS TO BEPREFERRED FOR WHAT WILL THEN REMAIN TO DO. AT MIDNIGHT THEN I HAVE TOASK YOU TO BE ALONE IN YOUR CONSULTING ROOM TO ADMIT WITH YOUR OWNHAND INTO THE HOUSE A MAN WHO WILL PRESENT HIMSELF IN MY NAME AND TOPLACE IN HIS HANDS THE DRAWER THAT YOU WILL HAVE BROUGHT WITH YOU FROMMY CABINET. THEN YOU WILL HAVE PLAYED YOUR PART AND EARNED MY GRATITUDECOMPLETELY. FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS IF YOU INSIST UPON AN EXPLANATIONYOU WILL HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE OF CAPITALIMPORTANCE AND THAT BY THE NEGLECT OF ONE OF THEM FANTASTIC AS THEYMUST APPEAR YOU MIGHT HAVE CHARGED YOUR CONSCIENCE WITH MY DEATH ORTHE SHIPWRECK OF MY REASON.CONFIDENT AS I AM THAT YOU WILL NOT TRIFLE WITH THIS APPEAL MY HEARTSINKS AND MY HAND TREMBLES AT THE BARE THOUGHT OF SUCH A POSSIBILITY.THINK OF ME AT THIS HOUR IN A STRANGE PLACE LABOURING UNDER ABLACKNESS OF DISTRESS THAT NO FANCY CAN EXAGGERATE AND YET WELL AWARETHAT IF YOU WILL BUT PUNCTUALLY SERVE ME MY TROUBLES WILL ROLL AWAYLIKE A STORY THAT IS TOLD. SERVE ME MY DEAR LANYON AND SAVEYOUR FRIENDH.J.P.S.I HAD ALREADY SEALED THIS UP WHEN A FRESH TERROR STRUCK UPON MYSOUL. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE POSTOFFICE MAY FAIL ME AND THIS LETTERNOT COME INTO YOUR HANDS UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING. IN THAT CASE DEARLANYON DO MY ERRAND WHEN IT SHALL BE MOST CONVENIENT FOR YOU IN THECOURSE OF THE DAY AND ONCE MORE EXPECT MY MESSENGER AT MIDNIGHT. ITMAY THEN ALREADY BE TOO LATE AND IF THAT NIGHT PASSES WITHOUT EVENTYOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SEEN THE LAST OF HENRY JEKYLL.UPON THE READING OF THIS LETTER I MADE SURE MY COLLEAGUE WAS INSANEBUT TILL THAT WAS PROVED BEYOND THE POSSIBILITY OF DOUBT I FELT BOUNDTO DO AS HE REQUESTED. THE LESS I UNDERSTOOD OF THIS FARRAGO THE LESSI WAS IN A POSITION TO JUDGE OF ITS IMPORTANCE AND AN APPEAL SO WORDEDCOULD NOT BE SET ASIDE WITHOUT A GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY. I ROSEACCORDINGLY FROM TABLE GOT INTO A HANSOM AND DROVE STRAIGHT TOJEKYLLS HOUSE. THE BUTLER WAS AWAITING MY ARRIVAL HE HAD RECEIVED BYTHE SAME POST AS MINE A REGISTERED LETTER OF INSTRUCTION AND HAD SENTAT ONCE FOR A LOCKSMITH AND A CARPENTER. THE TRADESMEN CAME WHILE WEWERE YET SPEAKING AND WE MOVED IN A BODY TO OLD DR. DENMANS SURGICALTHEATRE FROM WHICH AS YOU ARE DOUBTLESS AWARE JEKYLLS PRIVATECABINET IS MOST CONVENIENTLY ENTERED. THE DOOR WAS VERY STRONG THELOCK EXCELLENT THE CARPENTER AVOWED HE WOULD HAVE GREAT TROUBLE ANDHAVE TO DO MUCH DAMAGE IF FORCE WERE TO BE USED AND THE LOCKSMITH WASNEAR DESPAIR. BUT THIS LAST WAS A HANDY FELLOW AND AFTER TWO HOURSWORK THE DOOR STOOD OPEN. THE PRESS MARKED E WAS UNLOCKED AND I TOOKOUT THE DRAWER HAD IT FILLED UP WITH STRAW AND TIED IN A SHEET ANDRETURNED WITH IT TO CAVENDISH SQUARE.HERE I PROCEEDED TO EXAMINE ITS CONTENTS. THE POWDERS WERE NEATLYENOUGH MADE UP BUT NOT WITH THE NICETY OF THE DISPENSING CHEMIST SOTHAT IT WAS PLAIN THEY WERE OF JEKYLLS PRIVATE MANUFACTURE AND WHEN IOPENED ONE OF THE WRAPPERS I FOUND WHAT SEEMED TO ME A SIMPLECRYSTALLINE SALT OF A WHITE COLOUR. THE PHIAL TO WHICH I NEXT TURNEDMY ATTENTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABOUT HALF FULL OF A BLOODRED LIQUORWHICH WAS HIGHLY PUNGENT TO THE SENSE OF SMELL AND SEEMED TO ME TOCONTAIN PHOSPHORUS AND SOME VOLATILE ETHER. AT THE OTHER INGREDIENTS ICOULD MAKE NO GUESS. THE BOOK WAS AN ORDINARY VERSION BOOK ANDCONTAINED LITTLE BUT A SERIES OF DATES. THESE COVERED A PERIOD OF MANYYEARS BUT I OBSERVED THAT THE ENTRIES CEASED NEARLY A YEAR AGO ANDQUITE ABRUPTLY. HERE AND THERE A BRIEF REMARK WAS APPENDED TO A DATEUSUALLY NO MORE THAN A SINGLE WORD DOUBLE OCCURRING PERHAPS SIXTIMES IN A TOTAL OF SEVERAL HUNDRED ENTRIES AND ONCE VERY EARLY IN THELIST AND FOLLOWED BY SEVERAL MARKS OF EXCLAMATION TOTAL FAILUREALL THIS THOUGH IT WHETTED MY CURIOSITY TOLD ME LITTLE THAT WASDEFINITE. HERE WERE A PHIAL OF SOME SALT AND THE RECORD OF A SERIES OFEXPERIMENTS THAT HAD LED LIKE TOO MANY OF JEKYLLS INVESTIGATIONS TONO END OF PRACTICAL USEFULNESS. HOW COULD THE PRESENCE OF THESEARTICLES IN MY HOUSE AFFECT EITHER THE HONOUR THE SANITY OR THE LIFEOF MY FLIGHTY COLLEAGUE IF HIS MESSENGER COULD GO TO ONE PLACE WHYCOULD HE NOT GO TO ANOTHER AND EVEN GRANTING SOME IMPEDIMENT WHY WASTHIS GENTLEMAN TO BE RECEIVED BY ME IN SECRET THE MORE I REFLECTED THEMORE CONVINCED I GREW THAT I WAS DEALING WITH A CASE OF CEREBRALDISEASE AND THOUGH I DISMISSED MY SERVANTS TO BED I LOADED AN OLDREVOLVER THAT I MIGHT BE FOUND IN SOME POSTURE OF SELFDEFENCE.TWELVE OCLOCK HAD SCARCE RUNG OUT OVER LONDON ERE THE KNOCKER SOUNDEDVERY GENTLY ON THE DOOR. I WENT MYSELF AT THE SUMMONS AND FOUND ASMALL MAN CROUCHING AGAINST THE PILLARS OF THE PORTICO.ARE YOU COME FROM DR. JEKYLL I ASKED.HE TOLD ME YES BY A CONSTRAINED GESTURE AND WHEN I HAD BIDDEN HIMENTER HE DID NOT OBEY ME WITHOUT A SEARCHING BACKWARD GLANCE INTO THEDARKNESS OF THE SQUARE. THERE WAS A POLICEMAN NOT FAR OFF ADVANCINGWITH HIS BULLS EYE OPEN AND AT THE SIGHT I THOUGHT MY VISITORSTARTED AND MADE GREATER HASTE.THESE PARTICULARS STRUCK ME I CONFESS DISAGREEABLY AND AS I FOLLOWEDHIM INTO THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE CONSULTING ROOM I KEPT MY HAND READYON MY WEAPON. HERE AT LAST I HAD A CHANCE OF CLEARLY SEEING HIM. IHAD NEVER SET EYES ON HIM BEFORE SO MUCH WAS CERTAIN. HE WAS SMALL ASI HAVE SAID I WAS STRUCK BESIDES WITH THE SHOCKING EXPRESSION OF HISFACE WITH HIS REMARKABLE COMBINATION OF GREAT MUSCULAR ACTIVITY ANDGREAT APPARENT DEBILITY OF CONSTITUTION ANDLAST BUT NOT LEASTWITHTHE ODD SUBJECTIVE DISTURBANCE CAUSED BY HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD. THIS BORESOME RESEMBLANCE TO INCIPIENT RIGOUR AND WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A MARKEDSINKING OF THE PULSE. AT THE TIME I SET IT DOWN TO SOME IDIOSYNCRATICPERSONAL DISTASTE AND MERELY WONDERED AT THE ACUTENESS OF THESYMPTOMS BUT I HAVE SINCE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THE CAUSE TO LIE MUCHDEEPER IN THE NATURE OF MAN AND TO TURN ON SOME NOBLER HINGE THAN THEPRINCIPLE OF HATRED.THIS PERSON WHO HAD THUS FROM THE FIRST MOMENT OF HIS ENTRANCESTRUCK IN ME WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS A DISGUSTFUL CURIOSITY WASDRESSED IN A FASHION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE AN ORDINARY PERSON LAUGHABLEHIS CLOTHES THAT IS TO SAY ALTHOUGH THEY WERE OF RICH AND SOBERFABRIC WERE ENORMOUSLY TOO LARGE FOR HIM IN EVERY MEASUREMENTTHETROUSERS HANGING ON HIS LEGS AND ROLLED UP TO KEEP THEM FROM THEGROUND THE WAIST OF THE COAT BELOW HIS HAUNCHES AND THE COLLARSPRAWLING WIDE UPON HIS SHOULDERS. STRANGE TO RELATE THIS LUDICROUSACCOUTREMENT WAS FAR FROM MOVING ME TO LAUGHTER. RATHER AS THERE WASSOMETHING ABNORMAL AND MISBEGOTTEN IN THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE CREATURETHAT NOW FACED MESOMETHING SEIZING SURPRISING AND REVOLTINGTHISFRESH DISPARITY SEEMED BUT TO FIT IN WITH AND TO REINFORCE IT SO THATTO MY INTEREST IN THE MANS NATURE AND CHARACTER THERE WAS ADDED ACURIOSITY AS TO HIS ORIGIN HIS LIFE HIS FORTUNE AND STATUS IN THEWORLD.THESE OBSERVATIONS THOUGH THEY HAVE TAKEN SO GREAT A SPACE TO BE SETDOWN IN WERE YET THE WORK OF A FEW SECONDS. MY VISITOR WAS INDEED ONFIRE WITH SOMBRE EXCITEMENT.HAVE YOU GOT IT HE CRIED. HAVE YOU GOT IT AND SO LIVELY WAS HISIMPATIENCE THAT HE EVEN LAID HIS HAND UPON MY ARM AND SOUGHT TO SHAKEME.I PUT HIM BACK CONSCIOUS AT HIS TOUCH OF A CERTAIN ICY PANG ALONG MYBLOOD. COME SIR SAID I. YOU FORGET THAT I HAVE NOT YET THEPLEASURE OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE. BE SEATED IF YOU PLEASE. AND I SHOWEDHIM AN EXAMPLE AND SAT DOWN MYSELF IN MY CUSTOMARY SEAT AND WITH ASFAIR AN IMITATION OF MY ORDINARY MANNER TO A PATIENT AS THE LATENESSOF THE HOUR THE NATURE OF MY PREOCCUPATIONS AND THE HORROR I HAD OFMY VISITOR WOULD SUFFER ME TO MUSTER.I BEG YOUR PARDON DR. LANYON HE REPLIED CIVILLY ENOUGH. WHAT YOUSAY IS VERY WELL FOUNDED AND MY IMPATIENCE HAS SHOWN ITS HEELS TO MYPOLITENESS. I COME HERE AT THE INSTANCE OF YOUR COLLEAGUE DR. HENRYJEKYLL ON A PIECE OF BUSINESS OF SOME MOMENT AND I UNDERSTOOD... HEPAUSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS THROAT AND I COULD SEE IN SPITE OF HISCOLLECTED MANNER THAT HE WAS WRESTLING AGAINST THE APPROACHES OF THEHYSTERIAI UNDERSTOOD A DRAWER...BUT HERE I TOOK PITY ON MY VISITORS SUSPENSE AND SOME PERHAPS ON MYOWN GROWING CURIOSITY.THERE IT IS SIR SAID I POINTING TO THE DRAWER WHERE IT LAY ON THEFLOOR BEHIND A TABLE AND STILL COVERED WITH THE SHEET.HE SPRANG TO IT AND THEN PAUSED AND LAID HIS HAND UPON HIS HEART ICOULD HEAR HIS TEETH GRATE WITH THE CONVULSIVE ACTION OF HIS JAWS ANDHIS FACE WAS SO GHASTLY TO SEE THAT I GREW ALARMED BOTH FOR HIS LIFEAND REASON.COMPOSE YOURSELF SAID I.HE TURNED A DREADFUL SMILE TO ME AND AS IF WITH THE DECISION OFDESPAIR PLUCKED AWAY THE SHEET. AT SIGHT OF THE CONTENTS HE UTTEREDONE LOUD SOB OF SUCH IMMENSE RELIEF THAT I SAT PETRIFIED. AND THE NEXTMOMENT IN A VOICE THAT WAS ALREADY FAIRLY WELL UNDER CONTROL HAVEYOU A GRADUATED GLASS HE ASKED.I ROSE FROM MY PLACE WITH SOMETHING OF AN EFFORT AND GAVE HIM WHAT HEASKED.HE THANKED ME WITH A SMILING NOD MEASURED OUT A FEW MINIMS OF THE REDTINCTURE AND ADDED ONE OF THE POWDERS. THE MIXTURE WHICH WAS AT FIRSTOF A REDDISH HUE BEGAN IN PROPORTION AS THE CRYSTALS MELTED TOBRIGHTEN IN COLOUR TO EFFERVESCE AUDIBLY AND TO THROW OFF SMALL FUMESOF VAPOUR. SUDDENLY AND AT THE SAME MOMENT THE EBULLITION CEASED ANDTHE COMPOUND CHANGED TO A DARK PURPLE WHICH FADED AGAIN MORE SLOWLY TOA WATERY GREEN. MY VISITOR WHO HAD WATCHED THESE METAMORPHOSES WITH AKEEN EYE SMILED SET DOWN THE GLASS UPON THE TABLE AND THEN TURNEDAND LOOKED UPON ME WITH AN AIR OF SCRUTINY.AND NOW SAID HE TO SETTLE WHAT REMAINS. WILL YOU BE WISE WILL YOUBE GUIDED WILL YOU SUFFER ME TO TAKE THIS GLASS IN MY HAND AND TO GOFORTH FROM YOUR HOUSE WITHOUT FURTHER PARLEY OR HAS THE GREED OFCURIOSITY TOO MUCH COMMAND OF YOU THINK BEFORE YOU ANSWER FOR ITSHALL BE DONE AS YOU DECIDE. AS YOU DECIDE YOU SHALL BE LEFT AS YOUWERE BEFORE AND NEITHER RICHER NOR WISER UNLESS THE SENSE OF SERVICERENDERED TO A MAN IN MORTAL DISTRESS MAY BE COUNTED AS A KIND OF RICHESOF THE SOUL. OR IF YOU SHALL SO PREFER TO CHOOSE A NEW PROVINCE OFKNOWLEDGE AND NEW AVENUES TO FAME AND POWER SHALL BE LAID OPEN TO YOUHERE IN THIS ROOM UPON THE INSTANT AND YOUR SIGHT SHALL BE BLASTEDBY A PRODIGY TO STAGGER THE UNBELIEF OF SATAN.SIR SAID I AFFECTING A COOLNESS THAT I WAS FAR FROM TRULYPOSSESSING YOU SPEAK ENIGMAS AND YOU WILL PERHAPS NOT WONDER THAT IHEAR YOU WITH NO VERY STRONG IMPRESSION OF BELIEF. BUT I HAVE GONE TOOFAR IN THE WAY OF INEXPLICABLE SERVICES TO PAUSE BEFORE I SEE THE END.IT IS WELL REPLIED MY VISITOR. LANYON YOU REMEMBER YOUR VOWS WHATFOLLOWS IS UNDER THE SEAL OF OUR PROFESSION. AND NOW YOU WHO HAVE SOLONG BEEN BOUND TO THE MOST NARROW AND MATERIAL VIEWS YOU WHO HAVEDENIED THE VIRTUE OF TRANSCENDENTAL MEDICINE YOU WHO HAVE DERIDED YOURSUPERIORSBEHOLDHE PUT THE GLASS TO HIS LIPS AND DRANK AT ONE GULP. A CRY FOLLOWED HEREELED STAGGERED CLUTCHED AT THE TABLE AND HELD ON STARING WITHINJECTED EYES GASPING WITH OPEN MOUTH AND AS I LOOKED THERE CAME ITHOUGHT A CHANGEHE SEEMED TO SWELLHIS FACE BECAME SUDDENLY BLACK ANDTHE FEATURES SEEMED TO MELT AND ALTERAND THE NEXT MOMENT I HAD SPRUNGTO MY FEET AND LEAPED BACK AGAINST THE WALL MY ARMS RAISED TO SHIELDME FROM THAT PRODIGY MY MIND SUBMERGED IN TERROR.O GOD I SCREAMED AND O GOD AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR THERE BEFORE MYEYESPALE AND SHAKEN AND HALF FAINTING AND GROPING BEFORE HIM WITHHIS HANDS LIKE A MAN RESTORED FROM DEATHTHERE STOOD HENRY JEKYLLWHAT HE TOLD ME IN THE NEXT HOUR I CANNOT BRING MY MIND TO SET ONPAPER. I SAW WHAT I SAW I HEARD WHAT I HEARD AND MY SOUL SICKENED ATIT AND YET NOW WHEN THAT SIGHT HAS FADED FROM MY EYES I ASK MYSELF IFI BELIEVE IT AND I CANNOT ANSWER. MY LIFE IS SHAKEN TO ITS ROOTSSLEEP HAS LEFT ME THE DEADLIEST TERROR SITS BY ME AT ALL HOURS OF THEDAY AND NIGHT AND I FEEL THAT MY DAYS ARE NUMBERED AND THAT I MUSTDIE AND YET I SHALL DIE INCREDULOUS. AS FOR THE MORAL TURPITUDE THATMAN UNVEILED TO ME EVEN WITH TEARS OF PENITENCE I CANNOT EVEN INMEMORY DWELL ON IT WITHOUT A START OF HORROR. I WILL SAY BUT ONETHING UTTERSON AND THAT IF YOU CAN BRING YOUR MIND TO CREDIT ITWILL BE MORE THAN ENOUGH. THE CREATURE WHO CREPT INTO MY HOUSE THATNIGHT WAS ON JEKYLLS OWN CONFESSION KNOWN BY THE NAME OF HYDE ANDHUNTED FOR IN EVERY CORNER OF THE LAND AS THE MURDERER OF CAREW.HASTIE LANYON.HENRY JEKYLLS FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASEI WAS BORN IN THE YEAR  TO A LARGE FORTUNE ENDOWED BESIDES WITHEXCELLENT PARTS INCLINED BY NATURE TO INDUSTRY FOND OF THE RESPECT OFTHE WISE AND GOOD AMONG MY FELLOWMEN AND THUS AS MIGHT HAVE BEENSUPPOSED WITH EVERY GUARANTEE OF AN HONOURABLE AND DISTINGUISHEDFUTURE. AND INDEED THE WORST OF MY FAULTS WAS A CERTAIN IMPATIENTGAIETY OF DISPOSITION SUCH AS HAS MADE THE HAPPINESS OF MANY BUT SUCHAS I FOUND IT HARD TO RECONCILE WITH MY IMPERIOUS DESIRE TO CARRY MYHEAD HIGH AND WEAR A MORE THAN COMMONLY GRAVE COUNTENANCE BEFORE THEPUBLIC. HENCE IT CAME ABOUT THAT I CONCEALED MY PLEASURES AND THATWHEN I REACHED YEARS OF REFLECTION AND BEGAN TO LOOK ROUND ME AND TAKESTOCK OF MY PROGRESS AND POSITION IN THE WORLD I STOOD ALREADYCOMMITTED TO A PROFOUND DUPLICITY OF LIFE. MANY A MAN WOULD HAVE EVENBLAZONED SUCH IRREGULARITIES AS I WAS GUILTY OF BUT FROM THE HIGHVIEWS THAT I HAD SET BEFORE ME I REGARDED AND HID THEM WITH AN ALMOSTMORBID SENSE OF SHAME. IT WAS THUS RATHER THE EXACTING NATURE OF MYASPIRATIONS THAN ANY PARTICULAR DEGRADATION IN MY FAULTS THAT MADE MEWHAT I WAS AND WITH EVEN A DEEPER TRENCH THAN IN THE MAJORITY OF MENSEVERED IN ME THOSE PROVINCES OF GOOD AND ILL WHICH DIVIDE AND COMPOUNDMANS DUAL NATURE. IN THIS CASE I WAS DRIVEN TO REFLECT DEEPLY ANDINVETERATELY ON THAT HARD LAW OF LIFE WHICH LIES AT THE ROOT OFRELIGION AND IS ONE OF THE MOST PLENTIFUL SPRINGS OF DISTRESS. THOUGHSO PROFOUND A DOUBLEDEALER I WAS IN NO SENSE A HYPOCRITE BOTH SIDESOF ME WERE IN DEAD EARNEST I WAS NO MORE MYSELF WHEN I LAID ASIDERESTRAINT AND PLUNGED IN SHAME THAN WHEN I LABOURED IN THE EYE OFDAY AT THE FURTHERANCE OF KNOWLEDGE OR THE RELIEF OF SORROW ANDSUFFERING. AND IT CHANCED THAT THE DIRECTION OF MY SCIENTIFIC STUDIESWHICH LED WHOLLY TOWARDS THE MYSTIC AND THE TRANSCENDENTAL REACTED ANDSHED A STRONG LIGHT ON THIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PERENNIAL WAR AMONG MYMEMBERS. WITH EVERY DAY AND FROM BOTH SIDES OF MY INTELLIGENCE THEMORAL AND THE INTELLECTUAL I THUS DREW STEADILY NEARER TO THAT TRUTHBY WHOSE PARTIAL DISCOVERY I HAVE BEEN DOOMED TO SUCH A DREADFULSHIPWRECK THAT MAN IS NOT TRULY ONE BUT TRULY TWO. I SAY TWO BECAUSETHE STATE OF MY OWN KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT PASS BEYOND THAT POINT. OTHERSWILL FOLLOW OTHERS WILL OUTSTRIP ME ON THE SAME LINES AND I HAZARDTHE GUESS THAT MAN WILL BE ULTIMATELY KNOWN FOR A MERE POLITY OFMULTIFARIOUS INCONGRUOUS AND INDEPENDENT DENIZENS. I FOR MY PARTFROM THE NATURE OF MY LIFE ADVANCED INFALLIBLY IN ONE DIRECTION AND INONE DIRECTION ONLY. IT WAS ON THE MORAL SIDE AND IN MY OWN PERSONTHAT I LEARNED TO RECOGNISE THE THOROUGH AND PRIMITIVE DUALITY OF MANI SAW THAT OF THE TWO NATURES THAT CONTENDED IN THE FIELD OF MYCONSCIOUSNESS EVEN IF I COULD RIGHTLY BE SAID TO BE EITHER IT WASONLY BECAUSE I WAS RADICALLY BOTH AND FROM AN EARLY DATE EVEN BEFORETHE COURSE OF MY SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES HAD BEGUN TO SUGGEST THE MOSTNAKED POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A MIRACLE I HAD LEARNED TO DWELL WITHPLEASURE AS A BELOVED DAYDREAM ON THE THOUGHT OF THE SEPARATION OFTHESE ELEMENTS. IF EACH I TOLD MYSELF COULD BE HOUSED IN SEPARATEIDENTITIES LIFE WOULD BE RELIEVED OF ALL THAT WAS UNBEARABLE THEUNJUST MIGHT GO HIS WAY DELIVERED FROM THE ASPIRATIONS AND REMORSE OFHIS MORE UPRIGHT TWIN AND THE JUST COULD WALK STEADFASTLY AND SECURELYON HIS UPWARD PATH DOING THE GOOD THINGS IN WHICH HE FOUND HISPLEASURE AND NO LONGER EXPOSED TO DISGRACE AND PENITENCE BY THE HANDSOF THIS EXTRANEOUS EVIL. IT WAS THE CURSE OF MANKIND THAT THESEINCONGRUOUS FAGGOTS WERE THUS BOUND TOGETHERTHAT IN THE AGONISED WOMBOF CONSCIOUSNESS THESE POLAR TWINS SHOULD BE CONTINUOUSLY STRUGGLING.HOW THEN WERE THEY DISSOCIATEDI WAS SO FAR IN MY REFLECTIONS WHEN AS I HAVE SAID A SIDE LIGHT BEGANTO SHINE UPON THE SUBJECT FROM THE LABORATORY TABLE. I BEGAN TOPERCEIVE MORE DEEPLY THAN IT HAS EVER YET BEEN STATED THE TREMBLINGIMMATERIALITY THE MISTLIKE TRANSIENCE OF THIS SEEMINGLY SO SOLID BODYIN WHICH WE WALK ATTIRED. CERTAIN AGENTS I FOUND TO HAVE THE POWER TOSHAKE AND PLUCK BACK THAT FLESHLY VESTMENT EVEN AS A WIND MIGHT TOSSTHE CURTAINS OF A PAVILION. FOR TWO GOOD REASONS I WILL NOT ENTERDEEPLY INTO THIS SCIENTIFIC BRANCH OF MY CONFESSION. FIRST BECAUSE IHAVE BEEN MADE TO LEARN THAT THE DOOM AND BURTHEN OF OUR LIFE IS BOUNDFOR EVER ON MANS SHOULDERS AND WHEN THE ATTEMPT IS MADE TO CAST ITOFF IT BUT RETURNS UPON US WITH MORE UNFAMILIAR AND MORE AWFULPRESSURE. SECOND BECAUSE AS MY NARRATIVE WILL MAKE ALAS TOOEVIDENT MY DISCOVERIES WERE INCOMPLETE. ENOUGH THEN THAT I NOT ONLYRECOGNISED MY NATURAL BODY FROM THE MERE AURA AND EFFULGENCE OF CERTAINOF THE POWERS THAT MADE UP MY SPIRIT BUT MANAGED TO COMPOUND A DRUG BYWHICH THESE POWERS SHOULD BE DETHRONED FROM THEIR SUPREMACY AND ASECOND FORM AND COUNTENANCE SUBSTITUTED NONE THE LESS NATURAL TO MEBECAUSE THEY WERE THE EXPRESSION AND BORE THE STAMP OF LOWER ELEMENTSIN MY SOUL.I HESITATED LONG BEFORE I PUT THIS THEORY TO THE TEST OF PRACTICE. IKNEW WELL THAT I RISKED DEATH FOR ANY DRUG THAT SO POTENTLY CONTROLLEDAND SHOOK THE VERY FORTRESS OF IDENTITY MIGHT BY THE LEAST SCRUPLE OFAN OVERDOSE OR AT THE LEAST INOPPORTUNITY IN THE MOMENT OF EXHIBITIONUTTERLY BLOT OUT THAT IMMATERIAL TABERNACLE WHICH I LOOKED TO IT TOCHANGE. BUT THE TEMPTATION OF A DISCOVERY SO SINGULAR AND PROFOUND ATLAST OVERCAME THE SUGGESTIONS OF ALARM. I HAD LONG SINCE PREPARED MYTINCTURE I PURCHASED AT ONCE FROM A FIRM OF WHOLESALE CHEMISTS ALARGE QUANTITY OF A PARTICULAR SALT WHICH I KNEW FROM MY EXPERIMENTSTO BE THE LAST INGREDIENT REQUIRED AND LATE ONE ACCURSED NIGHT ICOMPOUNDED THE ELEMENTS WATCHED THEM BOIL AND SMOKE TOGETHER IN THEGLASS AND WHEN THE EBULLITION HAD SUBSIDED WITH A STRONG GLOW OFCOURAGE DRANK OFF THE POTION.THE MOST RACKING PANGS SUCCEEDED A GRINDING IN THE BONES DEADLYNAUSEA AND A HORROR OF THE SPIRIT THAT CANNOT BE EXCEEDED AT THE HOUROF BIRTH OR DEATH. THEN THESE AGONIES BEGAN SWIFTLY TO SUBSIDE AND ICAME TO MYSELF AS IF OUT OF A GREAT SICKNESS. THERE WAS SOMETHINGSTRANGE IN MY SENSATIONS SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY NEW AND FROM ITSVERY NOVELTY INCREDIBLY SWEET. I FELT YOUNGER LIGHTER HAPPIER INBODY WITHIN I WAS CONSCIOUS OF A HEADY RECKLESSNESS A CURRENT OFDISORDERED SENSUAL IMAGES RUNNING LIKE A MILLRACE IN MY FANCY ASOLUTION OF THE BONDS OF OBLIGATION AN UNKNOWN BUT NOT AN INNOCENTFREEDOM OF THE SOUL. I KNEW MYSELF AT THE FIRST BREATH OF THIS NEWLIFE TO BE MORE WICKED TENFOLD MORE WICKED SOLD A SLAVE TO MYORIGINAL EVIL AND THE THOUGHT IN THAT MOMENT BRACED AND DELIGHTED MELIKE WINE. I STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS EXULTING IN THE FRESHNESS OF THESESENSATIONS AND IN THE ACT I WAS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT I HAD LOST INSTATURE.THERE WAS NO MIRROR AT THAT DATE IN MY ROOM THAT WHICH STANDS BESIDEME AS I WRITE WAS BROUGHT THERE LATER ON AND FOR THE VERY PURPOSE OFTHESE TRANSFORMATIONS. THE NIGHT HOWEVER WAS FAR GONE INTO THEMORNINGTHE MORNING BLACK AS IT WAS WAS NEARLY RIPE FOR THECONCEPTION OF THE DAYTHE INMATES OF MY HOUSE WERE LOCKED IN THE MOSTRIGOROUS HOURS OF SLUMBER AND I DETERMINED FLUSHED AS I WAS WITH HOPEAND TRIUMPH TO VENTURE IN MY NEW SHAPE AS FAR AS TO MY BEDROOM. ICROSSED THE YARD WHEREIN THE CONSTELLATIONS LOOKED DOWN UPON ME ICOULD HAVE THOUGHT WITH WONDER THE FIRST CREATURE OF THAT SORT THATTHEIR UNSLEEPING VIGILANCE HAD YET DISCLOSED TO THEM I STOLE THROUGHTHE CORRIDORS A STRANGER IN MY OWN HOUSE AND COMING TO MY ROOM I SAWFOR THE FIRST TIME THE APPEARANCE OF EDWARD HYDE.I MUST HERE SPEAK BY THEORY ALONE SAYING NOT THAT WHICH I KNOW BUTTHAT WHICH I SUPPOSE TO BE MOST PROBABLE. THE EVIL SIDE OF MY NATURETO WHICH I HAD NOW TRANSFERRED THE STAMPING EFFICACY WAS LESS ROBUSTAND LESS DEVELOPED THAN THE GOOD WHICH I HAD JUST DEPOSED. AGAIN INTHE COURSE OF MY LIFE WHICH HAD BEEN AFTER ALL NINE TENTHS A LIFE OFEFFORT VIRTUE AND CONTROL IT HAD BEEN MUCH LESS EXERCISED AND MUCHLESS EXHAUSTED. AND HENCE AS I THINK IT CAME ABOUT THAT EDWARD HYDEWAS SO MUCH SMALLER SLIGHTER AND YOUNGER THAN HENRY JEKYLL. EVEN ASGOOD SHONE UPON THE COUNTENANCE OF THE ONE EVIL WAS WRITTEN BROADLYAND PLAINLY ON THE FACE OF THE OTHER. EVIL BESIDES WHICH I MUST STILLBELIEVE TO BE THE LETHAL SIDE OF MAN HAD LEFT ON THAT BODY AN IMPRINTOF DEFORMITY AND DECAY. AND YET WHEN I LOOKED UPON THAT UGLY IDOL INTHE GLASS I WAS CONSCIOUS OF NO REPUGNANCE RATHER OF A LEAP OFWELCOME. THIS TOO WAS MYSELF. IT SEEMED NATURAL AND HUMAN. IN MY EYESIT BORE A LIVELIER IMAGE OF THE SPIRIT IT SEEMED MORE EXPRESS ANDSINGLE THAN THE IMPERFECT AND DIVIDED COUNTENANCE I HAD BEEN HITHERTOACCUSTOMED TO CALL MINE. AND IN SO FAR I WAS DOUBTLESS RIGHT. I HAVEOBSERVED THAT WHEN I WORE THE SEMBLANCE OF EDWARD HYDE NONE COULD COMENEAR TO ME AT FIRST WITHOUT A VISIBLE MISGIVING OF THE FLESH. THIS ASI TAKE IT WAS BECAUSE ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS WE MEET THEM ARECOMMINGLED OUT OF GOOD AND EVIL AND EDWARD HYDE ALONE IN THE RANKS OFMANKIND WAS PURE EVIL.I LINGERED BUT A MOMENT AT THE MIRROR THE SECOND AND CONCLUSIVEEXPERIMENT HAD YET TO BE ATTEMPTED IT YET REMAINED TO BE SEEN IF I HADLOST MY IDENTITY BEYOND REDEMPTION AND MUST FLEE BEFORE DAYLIGHT FROM AHOUSE THAT WAS NO LONGER MINE AND HURRYING BACK TO MY CABINET I ONCEMORE PREPARED AND DRANK THE CUP ONCE MORE SUFFERED THE PANGS OFDISSOLUTION AND CAME TO MYSELF ONCE MORE WITH THE CHARACTER THESTATURE AND THE FACE OF HENRY JEKYLL.THAT NIGHT I HAD COME TO THE FATAL CROSSROADS. HAD I APPROACHED MYDISCOVERY IN A MORE NOBLE SPIRIT HAD I RISKED THE EXPERIMENT WHILEUNDER THE EMPIRE OF GENEROUS OR PIOUS ASPIRATIONS ALL MUST HAVE BEENOTHERWISE AND FROM THESE AGONIES OF DEATH AND BIRTH I HAD COME FORTHAN ANGEL INSTEAD OF A FIEND. THE DRUG HAD NO DISCRIMINATING ACTION ITWAS NEITHER DIABOLICAL NOR DIVINE IT BUT SHOOK THE DOORS OF THEPRISONHOUSE OF MY DISPOSITION AND LIKE THE CAPTIVES OF PHILIPPI THATWHICH STOOD WITHIN RAN FORTH. AT THAT TIME MY VIRTUE SLUMBERED MYEVIL KEPT AWAKE BY AMBITION WAS ALERT AND SWIFT TO SEIZE THEOCCASION AND THE THING THAT WAS PROJECTED WAS EDWARD HYDE. HENCEALTHOUGH I HAD NOW TWO CHARACTERS AS WELL AS TWO APPEARANCES ONE WASWHOLLY EVIL AND THE OTHER WAS STILL THE OLD HENRY JEKYLL THATINCONGRUOUS COMPOUND OF WHOSE REFORMATION AND IMPROVEMENT I HAD ALREADYLEARNED TO DESPAIR. THE MOVEMENT WAS THUS WHOLLY TOWARD THE WORSE.EVEN AT THAT TIME I HAD NOT CONQUERED MY AVERSIONS TO THE DRYNESS OF ALIFE OF STUDY. I WOULD STILL BE MERRILY DISPOSED AT TIMES AND AS MYPLEASURES WERE TO SAY THE LEAST UNDIGNIFIED AND I WAS NOT ONLY WELLKNOWN AND HIGHLY CONSIDERED BUT GROWING TOWARDS THE ELDERLY MAN THISINCOHERENCY OF MY LIFE WAS DAILY GROWING MORE UNWELCOME. IT WAS ON THISSIDE THAT MY NEW POWER TEMPTED ME UNTIL I FELL IN SLAVERY. I HAD BUT TODRINK THE CUP TO DOFF AT ONCE THE BODY OF THE NOTED PROFESSOR AND TOASSUME LIKE A THICK CLOAK THAT OF EDWARD HYDE. I SMILED AT THENOTION IT SEEMED TO ME AT THE TIME TO BE HUMOUROUS AND I MADE MYPREPARATIONS WITH THE MOST STUDIOUS CARE. I TOOK AND FURNISHED THATHOUSE IN SOHO TO WHICH HYDE WAS TRACKED BY THE POLICE AND ENGAGED ASA HOUSEKEEPER A CREATURE WHOM I KNEW WELL TO BE SILENT ANDUNSCRUPULOUS. ON THE OTHER SIDE I ANNOUNCED TO MY SERVANTS THAT A MR.HYDE WHOM I DESCRIBED WAS TO HAVE FULL LIBERTY AND POWER ABOUT MYHOUSE IN THE SQUARE AND TO PARRY MISHAPS I EVEN CALLED AND MADEMYSELF A FAMILIAR OBJECT IN MY SECOND CHARACTER. I NEXT DREW UP THATWILL TO WHICH YOU SO MUCH OBJECTED SO THAT IF ANYTHING BEFELL ME INTHE PERSON OF DR. JEKYLL I COULD ENTER ON THAT OF EDWARD HYDE WITHOUTPECUNIARY LOSS. AND THUS FORTIFIED AS I SUPPOSED ON EVERY SIDE IBEGAN TO PROFIT BY THE STRANGE IMMUNITIES OF MY POSITION.MEN HAVE BEFORE HIRED BRAVOS TO TRANSACT THEIR CRIMES WHILE THEIR OWNPERSON AND REPUTATION SAT UNDER SHELTER. I WAS THE FIRST THAT EVER DIDSO FOR HIS PLEASURES. I WAS THE FIRST THAT COULD PLOD IN THE PUBLIC EYEWITH A LOAD OF GENIAL RESPECTABILITY AND IN A MOMENT LIKE ASCHOOLBOY STRIP OFF THESE LENDINGS AND SPRING HEADLONG INTO THE SEA OFLIBERTY. BUT FOR ME IN MY IMPENETRABLE MANTLE THE SAFETY WASCOMPLETE. THINK OF ITI DID NOT EVEN EXIST LET ME BUT ESCAPE INTO MYLABORATORY DOOR GIVE ME BUT A SECOND OR TWO TO MIX AND SWALLOW THEDRAUGHT THAT I HAD ALWAYS STANDING READY AND WHATEVER HE HAD DONEEDWARD HYDE WOULD PASS AWAY LIKE THE STAIN OF BREATH UPON A MIRROR ANDTHERE IN HIS STEAD QUIETLY AT HOME TRIMMING THE MIDNIGHT LAMP IN HISSTUDY A MAN WHO COULD AFFORD TO LAUGH AT SUSPICION WOULD BE HENRYJEKYLL.THE PLEASURES WHICH I MADE HASTE TO SEEK IN MY DISGUISE WERE AS I HAVESAID UNDIGNIFIED I WOULD SCARCE USE A HARDER TERM. BUT IN THE HANDSOF EDWARD HYDE THEY SOON BEGAN TO TURN TOWARD THE MONSTROUS. WHEN IWOULD COME BACK FROM THESE EXCURSIONS I WAS OFTEN PLUNGED INTO A KINDOF WONDER AT MY VICARIOUS DEPRAVITY. THIS FAMILIAR THAT I CALLED OUT OFMY OWN SOUL AND SENT FORTH ALONE TO DO HIS GOOD PLEASURE WAS A BEINGINHERENTLY MALIGN AND VILLAINOUS HIS EVERY ACT AND THOUGHT CENTERED ONSELF DRINKING PLEASURE WITH BESTIAL AVIDITY FROM ANY DEGREE OF TORTURETO ANOTHER RELENTLESS LIKE A MAN OF STONE. HENRY JEKYLL STOOD AT TIMESAGHAST BEFORE THE ACTS OF EDWARD HYDE BUT THE SITUATION WAS APART FROMORDINARY LAWS AND INSIDIOUSLY RELAXED THE GRASP OF CONSCIENCE. IT WASHYDE AFTER ALL AND HYDE ALONE THAT WAS GUILTY. JEKYLL WAS NO WORSEHE WOKE AGAIN TO HIS GOOD QUALITIES SEEMINGLY UNIMPAIRED HE WOULD EVENMAKE HASTE WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO UNDO THE EVIL DONE BY HYDE. ANDTHUS HIS CONSCIENCE SLUMBERED.INTO THE DETAILS OF THE INFAMY AT WHICH I THUS CONNIVED FOR EVEN NOW ICAN SCARCE GRANT THAT I COMMITTED IT I HAVE NO DESIGN OF ENTERING IMEAN BUT TO POINT OUT THE WARNINGS AND THE SUCCESSIVE STEPS WITH WHICHMY CHASTISEMENT APPROACHED. I MET WITH ONE ACCIDENT WHICH AS ITBROUGHT ON NO CONSEQUENCE I SHALL NO MORE THAN MENTION. AN ACT OFCRUELTY TO A CHILD AROUSED AGAINST ME THE ANGER OF A PASSERBY WHOM IRECOGNISED THE OTHER DAY IN THE PERSON OF YOUR KINSMAN THE DOCTOR ANDTHE CHILDS FAMILY JOINED HIM THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I FEARED FOR MYLIFE AND AT LAST IN ORDER TO PACIFY THEIR TOO JUST RESENTMENT EDWARDHYDE HAD TO BRING THEM TO THE DOOR AND PAY THEM IN A CHEQUE DRAWN INTHE NAME OF HENRY JEKYLL. BUT THIS DANGER WAS EASILY ELIMINATED FROMTHE FUTURE BY OPENING AN ACCOUNT AT ANOTHER BANK IN THE NAME OF EDWARDHYDE HIMSELF AND WHEN BY SLOPING MY OWN HAND BACKWARD I HAD SUPPLIEDMY DOUBLE WITH A SIGNATURE I THOUGHT I SAT BEYOND THE REACH OF FATE.SOME TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE MURDER OF SIR DANVERS I HAD BEEN OUT FORONE OF MY ADVENTURES HAD RETURNED AT A LATE HOUR AND WOKE THE NEXTDAY IN BED WITH SOMEWHAT ODD SENSATIONS. IT WAS IN VAIN I LOOKED ABOUTME IN VAIN I SAW THE DECENT FURNITURE AND TALL PROPORTIONS OF MY ROOMIN THE SQUARE IN VAIN THAT I RECOGNISED THE PATTERN OF THE BEDCURTAINS AND THE DESIGN OF THE MAHOGANY FRAME SOMETHING STILL KEPTINSISTING THAT I WAS NOT WHERE I WAS THAT I HAD NOT WAKENED WHERE ISEEMED TO BE BUT IN THE LITTLE ROOM IN SOHO WHERE I WAS ACCUSTOMED TOSLEEP IN THE BODY OF EDWARD HYDE. I SMILED TO MYSELF AND IN MYPSYCHOLOGICAL WAY BEGAN LAZILY TO INQUIRE INTO THE ELEMENTS OF THISILLUSION OCCASIONALLY EVEN AS I DID SO DROPPING BACK INTO ACOMFORTABLE MORNING DOZE. I WAS STILL SO ENGAGED WHEN IN ONE OF MYMORE WAKEFUL MOMENTS MY EYES FELL UPON MY HAND. NOW THE HAND OF HENRYJEKYLL AS YOU HAVE OFTEN REMARKED WAS PROFESSIONAL IN SHAPE AND SIZEIT WAS LARGE FIRM WHITE AND COMELY. BUT THE HAND WHICH I NOW SAWCLEARLY ENOUGH IN THE YELLOW LIGHT OF A MIDLONDON MORNING LYING HALFSHUT ON THE BEDCLOTHES WAS LEAN CORDED KNUCKLY OF A DUSKY PALLORAND THICKLY SHADED WITH A SWART GROWTH OF HAIR. IT WAS THE HAND OFEDWARD HYDE.I MUST HAVE STARED UPON IT FOR NEAR HALF A MINUTE SUNK AS I WAS IN THEMERE STUPIDITY OF WONDER BEFORE TERROR WOKE UP IN MY BREAST AS SUDDENAND STARTLING AS THE CRASH OF CYMBALS AND BOUNDING FROM MY BED IRUSHED TO THE MIRROR. AT THE SIGHT THAT MET MY EYES MY BLOOD WASCHANGED INTO SOMETHING EXQUISITELY THIN AND ICY. YES I HAD GONE TO BEDHENRY JEKYLL I HAD AWAKENED EDWARD HYDE. HOW WAS THIS TO BE EXPLAINEDI ASKED MYSELF AND THEN WITH ANOTHER BOUND OF TERRORHOW WAS IT TO BEREMEDIED IT WAS WELL ON IN THE MORNING THE SERVANTS WERE UP ALL MYDRUGS WERE IN THE CABINETA LONG JOURNEY DOWN TWO PAIRS OF STAIRSTHROUGH THE BACK PASSAGE ACROSS THE OPEN COURT AND THROUGH THEANATOMICAL THEATRE FROM WHERE I WAS THEN STANDING HORRORSTRUCK. ITMIGHT INDEED BE POSSIBLE TO COVER MY FACE BUT OF WHAT USE WAS THATWHEN I WAS UNABLE TO CONCEAL THE ALTERATION IN MY STATURE AND THENWITH AN OVERPOWERING SWEETNESS OF RELIEF IT CAME BACK UPON MY MINDTHAT THE SERVANTS WERE ALREADY USED TO THE COMING AND GOING OF MYSECOND SELF. I HAD SOON DRESSED AS WELL AS I WAS ABLE IN CLOTHES OFMY OWN SIZE HAD SOON PASSED THROUGH THE HOUSE WHERE BRADSHAW STAREDAND DREW BACK AT SEEING MR. HYDE AT SUCH AN HOUR AND IN SUCH A STRANGEARRAY AND TEN MINUTES LATER DR. JEKYLL HAD RETURNED TO HIS OWN SHAPEAND WAS SITTING DOWN WITH A DARKENED BROW TO MAKE A FEINT OFBREAKFASTING.SMALL INDEED WAS MY APPETITE. THIS INEXPLICABLE INCIDENT THIS REVERSALOF MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE SEEMED LIKE THE BABYLONIAN FINGER ON THEWALL TO BE SPELLING OUT THE LETTERS OF MY JUDGMENT AND I BEGAN TOREFLECT MORE SERIOUSLY THAN EVER BEFORE ON THE ISSUES AND POSSIBILITIESOF MY DOUBLE EXISTENCE. THAT PART OF ME WHICH I HAD THE POWER OFPROJECTING HAD LATELY BEEN MUCH EXERCISED AND NOURISHED IT HAD SEEMEDTO ME OF LATE AS THOUGH THE BODY OF EDWARD HYDE HAD GROWN IN STATUREAS THOUGH WHEN I WORE THAT FORM I WERE CONSCIOUS OF A MORE GENEROUSTIDE OF BLOOD AND I BEGAN TO SPY A DANGER THAT IF THIS WERE MUCHPROLONGED THE BALANCE OF MY NATURE MIGHT BE PERMANENTLY OVERTHROWNTHE POWER OF VOLUNTARY CHANGE BE FORFEITED AND THE CHARACTER OF EDWARDHYDE BECOME IRREVOCABLY MINE. THE POWER OF THE DRUG HAD NOT BEEN ALWAYSEQUALLY DISPLAYED. ONCE VERY EARLY IN MY CAREER IT HAD TOTALLY FAILEDME SINCE THEN I HAD BEEN OBLIGED ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION TO DOUBLEAND ONCE WITH INFINITE RISK OF DEATH TO TREBLE THE AMOUNT AND THESERARE UNCERTAINTIES HAD CAST HITHERTO THE SOLE SHADOW ON MY CONTENTMENT.NOW HOWEVER AND IN THE LIGHT OF THAT MORNINGS ACCIDENT I WAS LED TOREMARK THAT WHEREAS IN THE BEGINNING THE DIFFICULTY HAD BEEN TO THROWOFF THE BODY OF JEKYLL IT HAD OF LATE GRADUALLY BUT DECIDEDLYTRANSFERRED ITSELF TO THE OTHER SIDE. ALL THINGS THEREFORE SEEMED TOPOINT TO THIS THAT I WAS SLOWLY LOSING HOLD OF MY ORIGINAL AND BETTERSELF AND BECOMING SLOWLY INCORPORATED WITH MY SECOND AND WORSE.BETWEEN THESE TWO I NOW FELT I HAD TO CHOOSE. MY TWO NATURES HADMEMORY IN COMMON BUT ALL OTHER FACULTIES WERE MOST UNEQUALLY SHAREDBETWEEN THEM. JEKYLL WHO WAS COMPOSITE NOW WITH THE MOST SENSITIVEAPPREHENSIONS NOW WITH A GREEDY GUSTO PROJECTED AND SHARED IN THEPLEASURES AND ADVENTURES OF HYDE BUT HYDE WAS INDIFFERENT TO JEKYLLOR BUT REMEMBERED HIM AS THE MOUNTAIN BANDIT REMEMBERS THE CAVERN INWHICH HE CONCEALS HIMSELF FROM PURSUIT. JEKYLL HAD MORE THAN A FATHERSINTEREST HYDE HAD MORE THAN A SONS INDIFFERENCE. TO CAST IN MY LOTWITH JEKYLL WAS TO DIE TO THOSE APPETITES WHICH I HAD LONG SECRETLYINDULGED AND HAD OF LATE BEGUN TO PAMPER. TO CAST IT IN WITH HYDE WASTO DIE TO A THOUSAND INTERESTS AND ASPIRATIONS AND TO BECOME AT ABLOW AND FOREVER DESPISED AND FRIENDLESS. THE BARGAIN MIGHT APPEARUNEQUAL BUT THERE WAS STILL ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IN THE SCALES FORWHILE JEKYLL WOULD SUFFER SMARTINGLY IN THE FIRES OF ABSTINENCE HYDEWOULD BE NOT EVEN CONSCIOUS OF ALL THAT HE HAD LOST. STRANGE AS MYCIRCUMSTANCES WERE THE TERMS OF THIS DEBATE ARE AS OLD AND COMMONPLACEAS MAN MUCH THE SAME INDUCEMENTS AND ALARMS CAST THE DIE FOR ANYTEMPTED AND TREMBLING SINNER AND IT FELL OUT WITH ME AS IT FALLS WITHSO VAST A MAJORITY OF MY FELLOWS THAT I CHOSE THE BETTER PART AND WASFOUND WANTING IN THE STRENGTH TO KEEP TO IT.YES I PREFERRED THE ELDERLY AND DISCONTENTED DOCTOR SURROUNDED BYFRIENDS AND CHERISHING HONEST HOPES AND BADE A RESOLUTE FAREWELL TOTHE LIBERTY THE COMPARATIVE YOUTH THE LIGHT STEP LEAPING IMPULSESAND SECRET PLEASURES THAT I HAD ENJOYED IN THE DISGUISE OF HYDE. IMADE THIS CHOICE PERHAPS WITH SOME UNCONSCIOUS RESERVATION FOR INEITHER GAVE UP THE HOUSE IN SOHO NOR DESTROYED THE CLOTHES OF EDWARDHYDE WHICH STILL LAY READY IN MY CABINET. FOR TWO MONTHS HOWEVER IWAS TRUE TO MY DETERMINATION FOR TWO MONTHS I LED A LIFE OF SUCHSEVERITY AS I HAD NEVER BEFORE ATTAINED TO AND ENJOYED THECOMPENSATIONS OF AN APPROVING CONSCIENCE. BUT TIME BEGAN AT LAST TOOBLITERATE THE FRESHNESS OF MY ALARM THE PRAISES OF CONSCIENCE BEGANTO GROW INTO A THING OF COURSE I BEGAN TO BE TORTURED WITH THROES ANDLONGINGS AS OF HYDE STRUGGLING AFTER FREEDOM AND AT LAST IN AN HOUROF MORAL WEAKNESS I ONCE AGAIN COMPOUNDED AND SWALLOWED THETRANSFORMING DRAUGHT.I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT WHEN A DRUNKARD REASONS WITH HIMSELF UPON HISVICE HE IS ONCE OUT OF FIVE HUNDRED TIMES AFFECTED BY THE DANGERS THATHE RUNS THROUGH HIS BRUTISH PHYSICAL INSENSIBILITY NEITHER HAD ILONG AS I HAD CONSIDERED MY POSITION MADE ENOUGH ALLOWANCE FOR THECOMPLETE MORAL INSENSIBILITY AND INSENSATE READINESS TO EVIL WHICHWERE THE LEADING CHARACTERS OF EDWARD HYDE. YET IT WAS BY THESE THAT IWAS PUNISHED. MY DEVIL HAD BEEN LONG CAGED HE CAME OUT ROARING. I WASCONSCIOUS EVEN WHEN I TOOK THE DRAUGHT OF A MORE UNBRIDLED A MOREFURIOUS PROPENSITY TO ILL. IT MUST HAVE BEEN THIS I SUPPOSE THATSTIRRED IN MY SOUL THAT TEMPEST OF IMPATIENCE WITH WHICH I LISTENED TOTHE CIVILITIES OF MY UNHAPPY VICTIM I DECLARE AT LEAST BEFORE GODNO MAN MORALLY SANE COULD HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF THAT CRIME UPON SOPITIFUL A PROVOCATION AND THAT I STRUCK IN NO MORE REASONABLE SPIRITTHAN THAT IN WHICH A SICK CHILD MAY BREAK A PLAYTHING. BUT I HADVOLUNTARILY STRIPPED MYSELF OF ALL THOSE BALANCING INSTINCTS BY WHICHEVEN THE WORST OF US CONTINUES TO WALK WITH SOME DEGREE OF STEADINESSAMONG TEMPTATIONS AND IN MY CASE TO BE TEMPTED HOWEVER SLIGHTLY WASTO FALL.INSTANTLY THE SPIRIT OF HELL AWOKE IN ME AND RAGED. WITH A TRANSPORT OFGLEE I MAULED THE UNRESISTING BODY TASTING DELIGHT FROM EVERY BLOWAND IT WAS NOT TILL WEARINESS HAD BEGUN TO SUCCEED THAT I WASSUDDENLY IN THE TOP FIT OF MY DELIRIUM STRUCK THROUGH THE HEART BY ACOLD THRILL OF TERROR. A MIST DISPERSED I SAW MY LIFE TO BE FORFEITAND FLED FROM THE SCENE OF THESE EXCESSES AT ONCE GLORYING ANDTREMBLING MY LUST OF EVIL GRATIFIED AND STIMULATED MY LOVE OF LIFESCREWED TO THE TOPMOST PEG. I RAN TO THE HOUSE IN SOHO AND TO MAKEASSURANCE DOUBLY SURE DESTROYED MY PAPERS THENCE I SET OUT THROUGHTHE LAMPLIT STREETS IN THE SAME DIVIDED ECSTASY OF MIND GLOATING ONMY CRIME LIGHTHEADEDLY DEVISING OTHERS IN THE FUTURE AND YET STILLHASTENING AND STILL HEARKENING IN MY WAKE FOR THE STEPS OF THE AVENGER.HYDE HAD A SONG UPON HIS LIPS AS HE COMPOUNDED THE DRAUGHT AND AS HEDRANK IT PLEDGED THE DEAD MAN. THE PANGS OF TRANSFORMATION HAD NOTDONE TEARING HIM BEFORE HENRY JEKYLL WITH STREAMING TEARS OFGRATITUDE AND REMORSE HAD FALLEN UPON HIS KNEES AND LIFTED HIS CLASPEDHANDS TO GOD. THE VEIL OF SELFINDULGENCE WAS RENT FROM HEAD TO FOOT. ISAW MY LIFE AS A WHOLE I FOLLOWED IT UP FROM THE DAYS OF CHILDHOODWHEN I HAD WALKED WITH MY FATHERS HAND AND THROUGH THE SELFDENYINGTOILS OF MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE TO ARRIVE AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH THE SAMESENSE OF UNREALITY AT THE DAMNED HORRORS OF THE EVENING. I COULD HAVESCREAMED ALOUD I SOUGHT WITH TEARS AND PRAYERS TO SMOTHER DOWN THECROWD OF HIDEOUS IMAGES AND SOUNDS WITH WHICH MY MEMORY SWARMED AGAINSTME AND STILL BETWEEN THE PETITIONS THE UGLY FACE OF MY INIQUITYSTARED INTO MY SOUL. AS THE ACUTENESS OF THIS REMORSE BEGAN TO DIEAWAY IT WAS SUCCEEDED BY A SENSE OF JOY. THE PROBLEM OF MY CONDUCT WASSOLVED. HYDE WAS THENCEFORTH IMPOSSIBLE WHETHER I WOULD OR NOT I WASNOW CONFINED TO THE BETTER PART OF MY EXISTENCE AND O HOW I REJOICEDTO THINK OF IT WITH WHAT WILLING HUMILITY I EMBRACED ANEW THERESTRICTIONS OF NATURAL LIFE WITH WHAT SINCERE RENUNCIATION I LOCKEDTHE DOOR BY WHICH I HAD SO OFTEN GONE AND COME AND GROUND THE KEYUNDER MY HEELTHE NEXT DAY CAME THE NEWS THAT THE MURDER HAD NOT BEEN OVERLOOKEDTHAT THE GUILT OF HYDE WAS PATENT TO THE WORLD AND THAT THE VICTIM WASA MAN HIGH IN PUBLIC ESTIMATION. IT WAS NOT ONLY A CRIME IT HAD BEEN ATRAGIC FOLLY. I THINK I WAS GLAD TO KNOW IT I THINK I WAS GLAD TO HAVEMY BETTER IMPULSES THUS BUTTRESSED AND GUARDED BY THE TERRORS OF THESCAFFOLD. JEKYLL WAS NOW MY CITY OF REFUGE LET BUT HYDE PEEP OUT ANINSTANT AND THE HANDS OF ALL MEN WOULD BE RAISED TO TAKE AND SLAY HIM.I RESOLVED IN MY FUTURE CONDUCT TO REDEEM THE PAST AND I CAN SAY WITHHONESTY THAT MY RESOLVE WAS FRUITFUL OF SOME GOOD. YOU KNOW YOURSELFHOW EARNESTLY IN THE LAST MONTHS OF THE LAST YEAR I LABOURED TORELIEVE SUFFERING YOU KNOW THAT MUCH WAS DONE FOR OTHERS AND THAT THEDAYS PASSED QUIETLY ALMOST HAPPILY FOR MYSELF. NOR CAN I TRULY SAYTHAT I WEARIED OF THIS BENEFICENT AND INNOCENT LIFE I THINK INSTEADTHAT I DAILY ENJOYED IT MORE COMPLETELY BUT I WAS STILL CURSED WITH MYDUALITY OF PURPOSE AND AS THE FIRST EDGE OF MY PENITENCE WORE OFF THELOWER SIDE OF ME SO LONG INDULGED SO RECENTLY CHAINED DOWN BEGAN TOGROWL FOR LICENCE. NOT THAT I DREAMED OF RESUSCITATING HYDE THE BAREIDEA OF THAT WOULD STARTLE ME TO FRENZY NO IT WAS IN MY OWN PERSONTHAT I WAS ONCE MORE TEMPTED TO TRIFLE WITH MY CONSCIENCE AND IT WASAS AN ORDINARY SECRET SINNER THAT I AT LAST FELL BEFORE THE ASSAULTS OFTEMPTATION.THERE COMES AN END TO ALL THINGS THE MOST CAPACIOUS MEASURE IS FILLEDAT LAST AND THIS BRIEF CONDESCENSION TO MY EVIL FINALLY DESTROYED THEBALANCE OF MY SOUL. AND YET I WAS NOT ALARMED THE FALL SEEMED NATURALLIKE A RETURN TO THE OLD DAYS BEFORE I HAD MADE MY DISCOVERY. IT WAS AFINE CLEAR JANUARY DAY WET UNDER FOOT WHERE THE FROST HAD MELTEDBUT CLOUDLESS OVERHEAD AND THE REGENTS PARK WAS FULL OF WINTERCHIRRUPINGS AND SWEET WITH SPRING ODOURS. I SAT IN THE SUN ON A BENCHTHE ANIMAL WITHIN ME LICKING THE CHOPS OF MEMORY THE SPIRITUAL SIDE ALITTLE DROWSED PROMISING SUBSEQUENT PENITENCE BUT NOT YET MOVED TOBEGIN. AFTER ALL I REFLECTED I WAS LIKE MY NEIGHBOURS AND THEN ISMILED COMPARING MYSELF WITH OTHER MEN COMPARING MY ACTIVE GOODWILLWITH THE LAZY CRUELTY OF THEIR NEGLECT. AND AT THE VERY MOMENT OF THATVAINGLORIOUS THOUGHT A QUALM CAME OVER ME A HORRID NAUSEA AND THEMOST DEADLY SHUDDERING. THESE PASSED AWAY AND LEFT ME FAINT AND THENAS IN ITS TURN FAINTNESS SUBSIDED I BEGAN TO BE AWARE OF A CHANGE INTHE TEMPER OF MY THOUGHTS A GREATER BOLDNESS A CONTEMPT OF DANGER ASOLUTION OF THE BONDS OF OBLIGATION. I LOOKED DOWN MY CLOTHES HUNGFORMLESSLY ON MY SHRUNKEN LIMBS THE HAND THAT LAY ON MY KNEE WASCORDED AND HAIRY. I WAS ONCE MORE EDWARD HYDE. A MOMENT BEFORE I HADBEEN SAFE OF ALL MENS RESPECT WEALTHY BELOVEDTHE CLOTH LAYING FORME IN THE DININGROOM AT HOME AND NOW I WAS THE COMMON QUARRY OFMANKIND HUNTED HOUSELESS A KNOWN MURDERER THRALL TO THE GALLOWS.MY REASON WAVERED BUT IT DID NOT FAIL ME UTTERLY. I HAVE MORE THANONCE OBSERVED THAT IN MY SECOND CHARACTER MY FACULTIES SEEMEDSHARPENED TO A POINT AND MY SPIRITS MORE TENSELY ELASTIC THUS IT CAMEABOUT THAT WHERE JEKYLL PERHAPS MIGHT HAVE SUCCUMBED HYDE ROSE TO THEIMPORTANCE OF THE MOMENT. MY DRUGS WERE IN ONE OF THE PRESSES OF MYCABINET HOW WAS I TO REACH THEM THAT WAS THE PROBLEM THAT CRUSHINGMY TEMPLES IN MY HANDS I SET MYSELF TO SOLVE. THE LABORATORY DOOR IHAD CLOSED. IF I SOUGHT TO ENTER BY THE HOUSE MY OWN SERVANTS WOULDCONSIGN ME TO THE GALLOWS. I SAW I MUST EMPLOY ANOTHER HAND ANDTHOUGHT OF LANYON. HOW WAS HE TO BE REACHED HOW PERSUADED SUPPOSINGTHAT I ESCAPED CAPTURE IN THE STREETS HOW WAS I TO MAKE MY WAY INTOHIS PRESENCE AND HOW SHOULD I AN UNKNOWN AND DISPLEASING VISITORPREVAIL ON THE FAMOUS PHYSICIAN TO RIFLE THE STUDY OF HIS COLLEAGUEDR. JEKYLL THEN I REMEMBERED THAT OF MY ORIGINAL CHARACTER ONE PARTREMAINED TO ME I COULD WRITE MY OWN HAND AND ONCE I HAD CONCEIVEDTHAT KINDLING SPARK THE WAY THAT I MUST FOLLOW BECAME LIGHTED UP FROMEND TO END.THEREUPON I ARRANGED MY CLOTHES AS BEST I COULD AND SUMMONING APASSING HANSOM DROVE TO AN HOTEL IN PORTLAND STREET THE NAME OF WHICHI CHANCED TO REMEMBER. AT MY APPEARANCE WHICH WAS INDEED COMICALENOUGH HOWEVER TRAGIC A FATE THESE GARMENTS COVERED THE DRIVER COULDNOT CONCEAL HIS MIRTH. I GNASHED MY TEETH UPON HIM WITH A GUST OFDEVILISH FURY AND THE SMILE WITHERED FROM HIS FACEHAPPILY FOR HIMYETMORE HAPPILY FOR MYSELF FOR IN ANOTHER INSTANT I HAD CERTAINLY DRAGGEDHIM FROM HIS PERCH. AT THE INN AS I ENTERED I LOOKED ABOUT ME WITH SOBLACK A COUNTENANCE AS MADE THE ATTENDANTS TREMBLE NOT A LOOK DID THEYEXCHANGE IN MY PRESENCE BUT OBSEQUIOUSLY TOOK MY ORDERS LED ME TO APRIVATE ROOM AND BROUGHT ME WHEREWITHAL TO WRITE. HYDE IN DANGER OFHIS LIFE WAS A CREATURE NEW TO ME SHAKEN WITH INORDINATE ANGER STRUNGTO THE PITCH OF MURDER LUSTING TO INFLICT PAIN. YET THE CREATURE WASASTUTE MASTERED HIS FURY WITH A GREAT EFFORT OF THE WILL COMPOSED HISTWO IMPORTANT LETTERS ONE TO LANYON AND ONE TO POOLE AND THAT HEMIGHT RECEIVE ACTUAL EVIDENCE OF THEIR BEING POSTED SENT THEM OUT WITHDIRECTIONS THAT THEY SHOULD BE REGISTERED. THENCEFORWARD HE SAT ALLDAY OVER THE FIRE IN THE PRIVATE ROOM GNAWING HIS NAILS THERE HEDINED SITTING ALONE WITH HIS FEARS THE WAITER VISIBLY QUAILING BEFOREHIS EYE AND THENCE WHEN THE NIGHT WAS FULLY COME HE SET FORTH IN THECORNER OF A CLOSED CAB AND WAS DRIVEN TO AND FRO ABOUT THE STREETS OFTHE CITY. HE I SAYI CANNOT SAY I. THAT CHILD OF HELL HAD NOTHINGHUMAN NOTHING LIVED IN HIM BUT FEAR AND HATRED. AND WHEN AT LASTTHINKING THE DRIVER HAD BEGUN TO GROW SUSPICIOUS HE DISCHARGED THE CABAND VENTURED ON FOOT ATTIRED IN HIS MISFITTING CLOTHES AN OBJECTMARKED OUT FOR OBSERVATION INTO THE MIDST OF THE NOCTURNAL PASSENGERSTHESE TWO BASE PASSIONS RAGED WITHIN HIM LIKE A TEMPEST. HE WALKEDFAST HUNTED BY HIS FEARS CHATTERING TO HIMSELF SKULKING THROUGH THELESS FREQUENTED THOROUGHFARES COUNTING THE MINUTES THAT STILL DIVIDEDHIM FROM MIDNIGHT. ONCE A WOMAN SPOKE TO HIM OFFERING I THINK A BOXOF LIGHTS. HE SMOTE HER IN THE FACE AND SHE FLED.WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF AT LANYONS THE HORROR OF MY OLD FRIEND PERHAPSAFFECTED ME SOMEWHAT I DO NOT KNOW IT WAS AT LEAST BUT A DROP IN THESEA TO THE ABHORRENCE WITH WHICH I LOOKED BACK UPON THESE HOURS. ACHANGE HAD COME OVER ME. IT WAS NO LONGER THE FEAR OF THE GALLOWS ITWAS THE HORROR OF BEING HYDE THAT RACKED ME. I RECEIVED LANYONSCONDEMNATION PARTLY IN A DREAM IT WAS PARTLY IN A DREAM THAT I CAMEHOME TO MY OWN HOUSE AND GOT INTO BED. I SLEPT AFTER THE PROSTRATION OFTHE DAY WITH A STRINGENT AND PROFOUND SLUMBER WHICH NOT EVEN THENIGHTMARES THAT WRUNG ME COULD AVAIL TO BREAK. I AWOKE IN THE MORNINGSHAKEN WEAKENED BUT REFRESHED. I STILL HATED AND FEARED THE THOUGHTOF THE BRUTE THAT SLEPT WITHIN ME AND I HAD NOT OF COURSE FORGOTTENTHE APPALLING DANGERS OF THE DAY BEFORE BUT I WAS ONCE MORE AT HOMEIN MY OWN HOUSE AND CLOSE TO MY DRUGS AND GRATITUDE FOR MY ESCAPESHONE SO STRONG IN MY SOUL THAT IT ALMOST RIVALLED THE BRIGHTNESS OFHOPE.I WAS STEPPING LEISURELY ACROSS THE COURT AFTER BREAKFAST DRINKING THECHILL OF THE AIR WITH PLEASURE WHEN I WAS SEIZED AGAIN WITH THOSEINDESCRIBABLE SENSATIONS THAT HERALDED THE CHANGE AND I HAD BUT THETIME TO GAIN THE SHELTER OF MY CABINET BEFORE I WAS ONCE AGAIN RAGINGAND FREEZING WITH THE PASSIONS OF HYDE. IT TOOK ON THIS OCCASION ADOUBLE DOSE TO RECALL ME TO MYSELF AND ALAS SIX HOURS AFTER AS I SATLOOKING SADLY IN THE FIRE THE PANGS RETURNED AND THE DRUG HAD TO BEREADMINISTERED. IN SHORT FROM THAT DAY FORTH IT SEEMED ONLY BY AGREAT EFFORT AS OF GYMNASTICS AND ONLY UNDER THE IMMEDIATE STIMULATIONOF THE DRUG THAT I WAS ABLE TO WEAR THE COUNTENANCE OF JEKYLL. AT ALLHOURS OF THE DAY AND NIGHT I WOULD BE TAKEN WITH THE PREMONITORYSHUDDER ABOVE ALL IF I SLEPT OR EVEN DOZED FOR A MOMENT IN MY CHAIRIT WAS ALWAYS AS HYDE THAT I AWAKENED. UNDER THE STRAIN OF THISCONTINUALLY IMPENDING DOOM AND BY THE SLEEPLESSNESS TO WHICH I NOWCONDEMNED MYSELF AY EVEN BEYOND WHAT I HAD THOUGHT POSSIBLE TO MAN IBECAME IN MY OWN PERSON A CREATURE EATEN UP AND EMPTIED BY FEVERLANGUIDLY WEAK BOTH IN BODY AND MIND AND SOLELY OCCUPIED BY ONETHOUGHT THE HORROR OF MY OTHER SELF. BUT WHEN I SLEPT OR WHEN THEVIRTUE OF THE MEDICINE WORE OFF I WOULD LEAP ALMOST WITHOUT TRANSITIONFOR THE PANGS OF TRANSFORMATION GREW DAILY LESS MARKED INTO THEPOSSESSION OF A FANCY BRIMMING WITH IMAGES OF TERROR A SOUL BOILINGWITH CAUSELESS HATREDS AND A BODY THAT SEEMED NOT STRONG ENOUGH TOCONTAIN THE RAGING ENERGIES OF LIFE. THE POWERS OF HYDE SEEMED TO HAVEGROWN WITH THE SICKLINESS OF JEKYLL. AND CERTAINLY THE HATE THAT NOWDIVIDED THEM WAS EQUAL ON EACH SIDE. WITH JEKYLL IT WAS A THING OFVITAL INSTINCT. HE HAD NOW SEEN THE FULL DEFORMITY OF THAT CREATURETHAT SHARED WITH HIM SOME OF THE PHENOMENA OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND WASCOHEIR WITH HIM TO DEATH AND BEYOND THESE LINKS OF COMMUNITY WHICHIN THEMSELVES MADE THE MOST POIGNANT PART OF HIS DISTRESS HE THOUGHTOF HYDE FOR ALL HIS ENERGY OF LIFE AS OF SOMETHING NOT ONLY HELLISHBUT INORGANIC. THIS WAS THE SHOCKING THING THAT THE SLIME OF THE PITSEEMED TO UTTER CRIES AND VOICES THAT THE AMORPHOUS DUST GESTICULATEDAND SINNED THAT WHAT WAS DEAD AND HAD NO SHAPE SHOULD USURP THEOFFICES OF LIFE. AND THIS AGAIN THAT THAT INSURGENT HORROR WAS KNIT TOHIM CLOSER THAN A WIFE CLOSER THAN AN EYE LAY CAGED IN HIS FLESHWHERE HE HEARD IT MUTTER AND FELT IT STRUGGLE TO BE BORN AND AT EVERYHOUR OF WEAKNESS AND IN THE CONFIDENCE OF SLUMBER PREVAILED AGAINSTHIM AND DEPOSED HIM OUT OF LIFE. THE HATRED OF HYDE FOR JEKYLL WAS OFA DIFFERENT ORDER. HIS TERROR OF THE GALLOWS DROVE HIM CONTINUALLY TOCOMMIT TEMPORARY SUICIDE AND RETURN TO HIS SUBORDINATE STATION OF APART INSTEAD OF A PERSON BUT HE LOATHED THE NECESSITY HE LOATHED THEDESPONDENCY INTO WHICH JEKYLL WAS NOW FALLEN AND HE RESENTED THEDISLIKE WITH WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF REGARDED. HENCE THE APELIKE TRICKSTHAT HE WOULD PLAY ME SCRAWLING IN MY OWN HAND BLASPHEMIES ON THEPAGES OF MY BOOKS BURNING THE LETTERS AND DESTROYING THE PORTRAIT OFMY FATHER AND INDEED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HIS FEAR OF DEATH HE WOULDLONG AGO HAVE RUINED HIMSELF IN ORDER TO INVOLVE ME IN THE RUIN. BUTHIS LOVE OF LIFE IS WONDERFUL I GO FURTHER I WHO SICKEN AND FREEZE ATTHE MERE THOUGHT OF HIM WHEN I RECALL THE ABJECTION AND PASSION OFTHIS ATTACHMENT AND WHEN I KNOW HOW HE FEARS MY POWER TO CUT HIM OFFBY SUICIDE I FIND IT IN MY HEART TO PITY HIM.IT IS USELESS AND THE TIME AWFULLY FAILS ME TO PROLONG THISDESCRIPTION NO ONE HAS EVER SUFFERED SUCH TORMENTS LET THAT SUFFICEAND YET EVEN TO THESE HABIT BROUGHTNO NOT ALLEVIATIONBUT A CERTAINCALLOUSNESS OF SOUL A CERTAIN ACQUIESCENCE OF DESPAIR AND MYPUNISHMENT MIGHT HAVE GONE ON FOR YEARS BUT FOR THE LAST CALAMITYWHICH HAS NOW FALLEN AND WHICH HAS FINALLY SEVERED ME FROM MY OWN FACEAND NATURE. MY PROVISION OF THE SALT WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN RENEWEDSINCE THE DATE OF THE FIRST EXPERIMENT BEGAN TO RUN LOW. I SENT OUTFOR A FRESH SUPPLY AND MIXED THE DRAUGHT THE EBULLITION FOLLOWED ANDTHE FIRST CHANGE OF COLOUR NOT THE SECOND I DRANK IT AND IT WASWITHOUT EFFICIENCY. YOU WILL LEARN FROM POOLE HOW I HAVE HAD LONDONRANSACKED IT WAS IN VAIN AND I AM NOW PERSUADED THAT MY FIRST SUPPLYWAS IMPURE AND THAT IT WAS THAT UNKNOWN IMPURITY WHICH LENT EFFICACYTO THE DRAUGHT.ABOUT A WEEK HAS PASSED AND I AM NOW FINISHING THIS STATEMENT UNDERTHE INFLUENCE OF THE LAST OF THE OLD POWDERS. THIS THEN IS THE LASTTIME SHORT OF A MIRACLE THAT HENRY JEKYLL CAN THINK HIS OWN THOUGHTSOR SEE HIS OWN FACE NOW HOW SADLY ALTERED IN THE GLASS. NOR MUST IDELAY TOO LONG TO BRING MY WRITING TO AN END FOR IF MY NARRATIVE HASHITHERTO ESCAPED DESTRUCTION IT HAS BEEN BY A COMBINATION OF GREATPRUDENCE AND GREAT GOOD LUCK. SHOULD THE THROES OF CHANGE TAKE ME INTHE ACT OF WRITING IT HYDE WILL TEAR IT IN PIECES BUT IF SOME TIMESHALL HAVE ELAPSED AFTER I HAVE LAID IT BY HIS WONDERFUL SELFISHNESSAND CIRCUMSCRIPTION TO THE MOMENT WILL PROBABLY SAVE IT ONCE AGAIN FROMTHE ACTION OF HIS APELIKE SPITE. AND INDEED THE DOOM THAT IS CLOSINGON US BOTH HAS ALREADY CHANGED AND CRUSHED HIM. HALF AN HOUR FROM NOWWHEN I SHALL AGAIN AND FOREVER REINDUE THAT HATED PERSONALITY I KNOWHOW I SHALL SIT SHUDDERING AND WEEPING IN MY CHAIR OR CONTINUE WITHTHE MOST STRAINED AND FEARSTRUCK ECSTASY OF LISTENING TO PACE UP ANDDOWN THIS ROOM MY LAST EARTHLY REFUGE AND GIVE EAR TO EVERY SOUND OFMENACE. WILL HYDE DIE UPON THE SCAFFOLD OR WILL HE FIND COURAGE TORELEASE HIMSELF AT THE LAST MOMENT GOD KNOWS I AM CARELESS THIS ISMY TRUE HOUR OF DEATH AND WHAT IS TO FOLLOW CONCERNS ANOTHER THANMYSELF. HERE THEN AS I LAY DOWN THE PEN AND PROCEED TO SEAL UP MYCONFESSION I BRING THE LIFE OF THAT UNHAPPY HENRY JEKYLL TO AN END.\n"
