      "St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the\n",
      "commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil\n",
      "forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\n",
      "my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\n",
      "of my undertaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\n",
      "Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\n",
      "braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this\n",
      "feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\n",
      "which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\n",
      "Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\n",
      "and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\n",
      "frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\n",
      "region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\n",
      "visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\n",
      "perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put\n",
      "some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;\n",
      "and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\n",
      "wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\n",
      "globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the\n",
      "phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\n",
      "solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I\n",
      "may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\n",
      "regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\n",
      "voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I\n",
      "shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\n",
      "never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\n",
      "the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\n",
      "conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\n",
      "laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\n",
      "boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\n",
      "native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\n",
      "cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\n",
      "mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\n",
      "to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\n",
      "requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\n",
      "all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\n",
      "letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\n",
      "to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\n",
      "a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\n",
      "eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\n",
      "have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\n",
      "been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\n",
      "through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a\n",
      "history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\n",
      "whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,\n",
      "yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study\n",
      "day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\n",
      "I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction\n",
      "had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\n",
      "\n",
      "These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\n",
      "whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also\n",
      "became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\n",
      "I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\n",
      "names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well\n",
      "acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\n",
      "But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\n",
      "thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I\n",
      "can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\n",
      "great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I\n",
      "accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\n",
      "I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\n",
      "worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\n",
      "nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\n",
      "branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\n",
      "the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an\n",
      "under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I\n",
      "must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\n",
      "dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\n",
      "earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\n",
      "My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\n",
      "every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\n",
      "voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is\n",
      "firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am\n",
      "about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\n",
      "will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\n",
      "of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly\n",
      "quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\n",
      "my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The\n",
      "cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have\n",
      "already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\n",
      "deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\n",
      "prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no\n",
      "ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\n",
      "Archangel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\n",
      "intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\n",
      "insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\n",
      "among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to\n",
      "sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how\n",
      "can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\n",
      "will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,\n",
      "or never.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,\n",
      "and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your\n",
      "love and kindness.\n",

      "_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n",
      "\n",
      "Archangel, 28th March, 17—.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\n",
      "Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a\n",
      "vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have\n",
      "already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly\n",
      "possessed of dauntless courage.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\n",
      "absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\n",
      "friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\n",
      "will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no\n",
      "one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts\n",
      "to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\n",
      "feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\n",
      "eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\n",
      "bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\n",
      "courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\n",
      "tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\n",
      "friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\n",
      "and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\n",
      "that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\n",
      "on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.\n",
      "At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\n",
      "country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\n",
      "most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\n",
      "necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\n",
      "country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\n",
      "schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\n",
      "daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\n",
      "call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\n",
      "enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\n",
      "endeavour to regulate my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\n",
      "wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\n",
      "some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\n",
      "rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\n",
      "and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\n",
      "more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\n",
      "Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\n",
      "unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\n",
      "humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\n",
      "finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\n",
      "in my enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\n",
      "ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\n",
      "circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\n",
      "me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\n",
      "spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\n",
      "groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\n",
      "the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\n",
      "necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\n",
      "of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\n",
      "myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\n",
      "of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\n",
      "happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\n",
      "a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\n",
      "sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\n",
      "his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\n",
      "tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\n",
      "confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\n",
      "and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\n",
      "reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\n",
      "instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\n",
      "money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\n",
      "bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\n",
      "prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\n",
      "woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old\n",
      "man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\n",
      "when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\n",
      "until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\n",
      "inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is\n",
      "so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\n",
      "of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\n",
      "the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\n",
      "otherwise he would command.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\n",
      "conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\n",
      "wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\n",
      "is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The\n",
      "winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\n",
      "is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\n",
      "sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me\n",
      "sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\n",
      "safety of others is committed to my care.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\n",
      "undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\n",
      "the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\n",
      "I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the\n",
      "land of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\n",
      "be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\n",
      "woeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I\n",
      "will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my\n",
      "passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\n",
      "production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something\n",
      "at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically\n",
      "industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and\n",
      "labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\n",
      "in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\n",
      "of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\n",
      "regions I am about to explore.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after\n",
      "having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of\n",
      "Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to\n",
      "look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to\n",
      "me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when\n",
      "I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. \n",

      "in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to\n",
      "have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to\n",
      "grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly\n",
      "attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own\n",
      "situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by\n",
      "dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a\n",
      "being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\n",
      "sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress\n",
      "of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the\n",
      "distant inequalities of the ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,\n",
      "many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that\n",
      "it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by\n",
      "ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the\n",
      "greatest attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before\n",
      "night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the\n",
      "morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which\n",
      "float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to\n",
      "rest for a few hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and\n",
      "found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently\n",
      "talking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we\n",
      "had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large\n",
      "fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human\n",
      "being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.\n",
      "He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\n",
      "some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the\n",
      "master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\n",
      "on the open sea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a\n",
      "foreign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,\n",
      "“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”\n",
      "\n",
      "You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed\n",
      "to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have\n",
      "supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\n",
      "have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I\n",
      "replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\n",
      "northern pole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.\n",
      "Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\n",
      "his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were\n",
      "nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and\n",
      "suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted\n",
      "to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\n",
      "air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and\n",
      "restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to\n",
      "swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we\n",
      "wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\n",
      "kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\n",
      "which restored him wonderfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often\n",
      "feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he\n",
      "had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and\n",
      "attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more\n",
      "interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of\n",
      "wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\n",
      "performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most\n",
      "trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with\n",
      "a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he\n",
      "is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his\n",
      "teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.\n",

      "allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\n",
      "and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.\n",
      "Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice\n",
      "in so strange a vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and\n",
      "he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we\n",
      "saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of\n",
      "questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had\n",
      "pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,\n",
      "doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good\n",
      "people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to\n",
      "trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\n",
      "benevolently restored me to life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the\n",
      "ice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer\n",
      "with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near\n",
      "midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety\n",
      "before that time; but of this I could not judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\n",
      "stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for\n",
      "the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in\n",
      "the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.\n",

      "Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all\n",
      "interested in him, although they have had very little communication\n",
      "with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his\n",
      "constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must\n",

      "noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant\n",
      "grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and\n",

      "interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently\n",

      "disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my\n",
      "eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken\n",
      "to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the\n",

      "and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would\n",
      "sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my\n",

      "the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should\n",

      "his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle\n",
      "fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I\n",

      "Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the\n",

      "necessary to restore his composure.\n",

      "Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise\n",
      "himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of\n",

      "me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it\n",
      "awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a\n",
      "friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than\n",
      "had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could\n",
      "boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.\n",

      "ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to\n",
      "perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most\n",
      "noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting\n",
      "friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for\n",

      "I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most\n",
      "distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years\n",
      "counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public\n",
      "situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who\n",
      "knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public\n",
      "business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the\n",
      "affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\n",
      "marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a\n",
      "husband and the father of a family.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\n",
      "refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a\n",
      "merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\n",
      "mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\n",
      "proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty\n",
      "and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\n",
      "distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,\n",
      "therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his\n",
      "daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in\n",
      "wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and\n",
      "was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.\n",
      "He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct\n",
      "so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in\n",
      "endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin\n",
      "the world again through his credit and assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten\n",
      "months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,\n",
      "he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the\n",
      "Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort\n",
      "had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but\n",
      "it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in\n",
      "the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a\n",
      "merchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;\n",
      "his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for\n",
      "reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end\n",
      "of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw\n",
      "with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that\n",
      "there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort\n",
      "possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support\n",
      "her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and\n",
      "by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to\n",
      "support life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time\n",
      "was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\n",
      "decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\n",
      "her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt\n",
      "by Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\n",
      "chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\n",
      "committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he\n",
      "conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\n",
      "relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but\n",
      "this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted\n",
      "affection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind\n",
      "which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\n",
      "strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\n",
      "late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set\n",
      "a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and\n",
      "worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\n",
      "doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\n",
      "virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\n",
      "her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\n",
      "to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes\n",
      "and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is\n",
      "sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her\n",
      "with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\n",
      "benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto\n",
      "constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During\n",
      "the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\n",
      "gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after\n",
      "their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change\n",
      "of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\n",
      "as a restorative for her weakened frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born\n",
      "at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained\n",
      "for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each\n",
      "other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very\n",
      "mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and\n",
      "my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my\n",
      "first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something\n",
      "better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on\n",
      "them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in\n",
      "their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled\n",
      "their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed\n",

      "passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent\n",
      "disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my\n",

      "relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\n",
      "afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale\n",
      "attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\n",
      "of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst\n",
      "shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,\n",
      "accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,\n",
      "hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to\n",

      "above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were\n",
      "dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her\n",
      "hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her\n",
      "clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was\n",
      "clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of\n",
      "her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold\n",
      "her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,\n",
      "and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.\n",
      "\n",
      "The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and\n",

      "not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a\n",
      "German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with\n",
      "these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been\n",
      "long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their\n",
      "charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory\n",
      "of Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted\n",
      "himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its\n",
      "weakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria\n",
      "was not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and\n",

      "than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his\n",
      "permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their\n",

      "indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,\n",
      "nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states\n",

      "ignorantly I had repined.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew\n",
      "more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their\n",

      "century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of\n",

      "him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His\n",
      "father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the\n",
      "aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune\n",
      "of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when\n",
      "he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a\n",
      "restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details\n",
      "of commerce.\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor\n",
      "persuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and we\n",
      "retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the\n",
      "other was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the\n",
      "carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father\n",
      "again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to\n",
      "renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last\n",
      "feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in\n",
      "the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by\n",
      "amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual\n",
      "pleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I\n",
      "must form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto\n",
      "been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible\n",
      "repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and\n",
      "Clerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself\n",
      "totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as\n",
      "I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I\n",
      "ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,\n",
      "thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had\n",
      "longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. \n",
      "Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to\n",
      "repent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my\n",
      "journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the\n",
      "high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was\n",
      "conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to\n",
      "some of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil\n",
      "influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me\n",
      "from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s\n",
      "door—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He\n",
      "was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He\n",
      "asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches\n",
      "of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and\n",
      "partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal\n",
      "authors I had studied. The professor stared. “Have you,” he\n",
      "said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with\n",
      "warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly\n",
      "and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems\n",
      "and useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived,\n",
      "where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you\n",
      "have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they\n",
      "are ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific\n",
      "age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear\n",
      "sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books\n",
      "treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and\n",
      "dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following\n",
      "week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural\n",
      "philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow\n",
      "professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he\n",
      "omitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long\n",
      "considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I\n",
      "returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any\n",
      "shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a\n",
      "repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in\n",
      "favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a\n",
      "strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come\n",
      "to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been\n",
      "content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural\n",
      "science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my\n",
      "extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the\n",
      "steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the\n",
      "discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.\n",
      "Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.\n",
      "It was very different when the masters of the science sought\n",
      "immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now\n",
      "the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit\n",
      "itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in\n",
      "science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of\n",
      "boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my\n",
      "residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming\n",
      "acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new\n",
      "abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information\n",
      "which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I\n",
      "could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver\n",
      "sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\n",
      "Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing\n",
      "room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very\n",
      "unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an\n",
      "aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his\n",
      "temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person\n",
      "was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.\n",
      "He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and\n",
      "the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing\n",
      "with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took\n",
      "a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of\n",
      "its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he\n",
      "concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I\n",
      "shall never forget:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,\n",
      "“promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters\n",
      "promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that\n",
      "the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem\n",
      "only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or\n",
      "crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses\n",
      "of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the\n",
      "heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of\n",
      "the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;\n",
      "they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even\n",
      "mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of\n",
      "the fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul\n",
      "were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were\n",
      "touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was\n",
      "sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,\n",
      "one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of\n",
      "Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps\n",
      "already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\n",
      "unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of\n",
      "insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I\n",
      "had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,\n",
      "sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.\n",
      "There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to\n",
      "devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a\n",
      "natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His\n",
      "manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,\n",
      "for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in\n",
      "his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I\n",
      "gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had\n",
      "given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little\n",
      "narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius\n",
      "Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had\n",
      "exhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal\n",
      "modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\n",
      "knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names\n",
      "and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a\n",
      "great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The\n",
      "labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever\n",
      "fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I\n",
      "listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption\n",
      "or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my\n",
      "prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured\n",
      "terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his\n",
      "instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have\n",
      "made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended\n",
      "labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to\n",
      "procure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a\n",
      "disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of\n",
      "your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the\n",
      "greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that\n",
      "I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not\n",
      "neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry\n",
      "chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your\n",
      "wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty\n",
      "experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural\n",
      "philosophy, including mathematics.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his\n",
      "various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and\n",
      "promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in\n",
      "the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of\n",
      "books which I had requested, and I took my leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the\n",
      "most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.\n",
      "I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\n",
      "which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the\n",
      "lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the\n",
      "university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense\n",
      "and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\n",
      "physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In\n",
      "M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by\n",
      "dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and\n",
      "good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways\n",
      "he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\n",
      "inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at\n",
      "first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and\n",
      "soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the\n",
      "light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress\n",
      "was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and\n",
      "my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,\n",
      "with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman\n",
      "expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years\n",
      "passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was\n",
      "engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I\n",
      "hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive\n",
      "of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as\n",
      "others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\n",
      "a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\n",
      "A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\n",
      "infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\n",
      "continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was\n",
      "solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two\n",
      "years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical\n",
      "instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\n",
      "university. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well\n",
      "acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as\n",
      "depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\n",
      "residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought\n",
      "of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\n",
      "happened that protracted my stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was\n",
      "the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with\n",
      "life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?\n",
      "It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a\n",
      "mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming\n",
      "acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our\n",
      "inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined\n",
      "thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of\n",
      "natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been\n",
      "animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this\n",
      "study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the\n",
      "causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became\n",
      "acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I\n",
      "must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.\n",
      "In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my\n",
      "mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever\n",
      "remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared\n",
      "the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and\n",
      "a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of\n",
      "life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become\n",
      "food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of\n",
      "this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and\n",
      "charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most\n",
      "insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the\n",
      "fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of\n",
      "death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm\n",
      "inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and\n",
      "analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change\n",
      "from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this\n",
      "darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and\n",
      "wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity\n",
      "of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\n",
      "many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same\n",
      "science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a\n",
      "secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not\n",
      "more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is\n",
      "true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the\n",
      "discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of\n",
      "incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of\n",
      "generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing\n",
      "animation upon lifeless matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery\n",
      "soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in\n",
      "painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the\n",
      "most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so\n",
      "great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been\n",
      "progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.\n",
      "What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation\n",
      "of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it\n",
      "all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a\n",
      "nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them\n",
      "towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already\n",
      "accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\n",
      "and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly\n",
      "ineffectual light.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes\n",
      "express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with\n",
      "which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end\n",
      "of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that\n",
      "subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,\n",
      "to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my\n",
      "precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of\n",
      "knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town\n",
      "to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature\n",
      "will allow.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated\n",
      "a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.\n",
      "Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to\n",
      "prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of\n",
      "fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable\n",
      "difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the\n",
      "creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my\n",
      "imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to\n",
      "doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful\n",
      "as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared\n",
      "adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\n",
      "ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my\n",
      "operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be\n",
      "imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes\n",
      "place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present\n",
      "attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor\n",
      "could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any\n",
      "argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I\n",
      "began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts\n",
      "formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first\n",
      "intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,\n",
      "about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having\n",
      "formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully\n",
      "collecting and arranging my materials, I began.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like\n",
      "a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death\n",
      "appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and\n",
      "pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless\n",
      "me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would\n",
      "owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his\n",
      "child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these\n",
      "reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless\n",
      "matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)\n",
      "renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking\n",
      "with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my\n",
      "person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very\n",
      "brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the\n",
      "next day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone\n",
      "possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon\n",
      "gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless\n",
      "eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive\n",
      "the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps\n",
      "of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless\n",
      "clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but\n",
      "then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed\n",

      "returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and\n",

      "and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\n",
      "I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\n",

      "vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the\n",
      "same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also\n",
      "to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had\n",
      "not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I\n",
      "well remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are\n",
      "pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall\n",
      "hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any\n",
      "interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties\n",
      "are equally neglected.”\n",

      "not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which\n",
      "had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it\n",

      "blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and\n",
      "peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to\n",
      "disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge\n",
      "is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself\n",
      "has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for\n",

      "that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty\n",
      "of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my\n",

      "rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\n",

      "succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the\n",
      "bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.\n",
      "But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest\n",

      "but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with\n",

      "created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they\n",
      "may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some\n",
      "inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have\n",
      "spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\n",
      "detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the\n",
      "courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained\n",
      "during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest\n",
      "agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if\n",

      "calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial\n",

      "the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my\n",
      "apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to\n",
      "behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.\n",
      "Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the\n",

      "cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as\n",
      "children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in\n",
      "waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped\n",
      "fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed\n",
      "from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good\n",
      "fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy\n",
      "had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.\n",

      "We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;\n",

      "me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse\n",
      "beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\n",
      "place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.\n",

      "unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.\n",
      "The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever\n",
      "before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my\n",
      "words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings\n",
      "of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I\n",
      "continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder\n",

      "\n",
      "By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and\n",
      "grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became\n",
      "capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I\n",
      "perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young\n",
      "buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was\n",
      "a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my\n",

      "this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother\n",
      "to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our\n",
      "country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which\n",
      "prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less\n",
      "distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the\n",
      "lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\n",
      "more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same\n",
      "thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in\n",
      "our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our\n",
      "fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a\n",
      "sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\n",

      "glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\n",
      "Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so\n",
      "frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,\n",
      "by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that\n",
      "which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid;\n",
      "Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not\n",
      "mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but\n",
      "you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.\n",
      "Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,\n",
      "yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She\n",
      "thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her\n",

      "trials were reserved for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\n",
      "exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The\n",
      "conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the\n",
      "deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her\n",
      "partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor\n",
      "confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months\n",
      "after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her\n",
      "repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she\n",
      "was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness\n",
      "and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable\n",
      "for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature\n",
      "to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her\n",
      "repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,\n",
      "but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her\n",
      "brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz\n",
      "into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is\n",
      "now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,\n",
      "at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us;\n",
      "and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,\n",

      "\n",
      "One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the\n",
      "several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a\n",
      "kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had\n",
      "sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the\n",
      "beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even\n",
      "to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored\n",
      "to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony\n",
      "of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my\n",
      "apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he\n",
      "perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had\n",
      "previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of\n",
      "no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture\n",
      "when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I\n",
      "had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the\n",
      "subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to\n",
      "modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science\n",
      "itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What\n",
      "could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he\n",
      "had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which\n",
      "were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I\n",
      "writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.\n",
      "Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the\n",
      "sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his\n",
      "total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I\n",
      "thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly\n",
      "that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from\n",
      "me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence\n",
      "that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in\n",

      "outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A\n",
      "youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly\n",
      "as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if\n",
      "he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay,\n",

      "Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his\n",
      "literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He\n",
      "came to the university with the design of making himself complete\n",
      "master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for\n",
      "the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no\n",
      "inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording\n",
      "scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit\n",
      "languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on\n",
      "the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I\n",
      "wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt\n",
      "great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not\n",
      "only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I\n",
      "did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for\n",
      "I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary\n",
      "amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well\n",
      "repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy\n",
      "elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of\n",
      "any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to\n",
      "consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns\n",
      "of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How\n",
      "different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!\n",

      "and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this\n",
      "delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved\n",

      "unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become\n",
      "acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent\n",

      "personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded\n",
      "with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval\n",
      "had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature\n",
      "that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.\n",
      "\n",
      "We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits\n",
      "had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the\n",
      "salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and\n",
      "the conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the\n",
      "intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but\n",
      "Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught\n",
      "me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.\n",
      "Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to\n",
      "elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish\n",
      "pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and\n",
      "affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature\n",
      "who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.\n",
      "When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most\n",

      "ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring\n",
      "bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I\n",

      "Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he\n",
      "exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled\n",

      "astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in\n",
      "imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful\n",

      "happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved\n",
      "country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again\n",
      "beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely\n",
      "lake!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also\n",
      "closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still\n",
      "more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I\n",
      "foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human\n",
      "beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single\n",
      "circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not\n",
      "conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates\n",
      "of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at\n",
      "Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky\n",
      "was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot\n",
      "where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the\n",
      "town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.\n",
      "During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont\n",
      "Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach\n",
      "rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its\n",
      "progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain\n",
      "coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.\n",
      "\n",
      "I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm\n",
      "increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash\n",
      "over my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of\n",
      "Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the\n",
      "lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant\n",
      "every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself\n",
      "from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in\n",
      "Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The\n",
      "most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the\n",
      "lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of\n",
      "Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another\n",
      "darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the\n",
      "east of the lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with\n",
      "a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my\n",
      "hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy\n",
      "funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the\n",
      "gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood\n",
      "fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning\n",
      "illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\n",
      "gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs\n",
      "to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy\n",
      "dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I\n",
      "shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that\n",
      "idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth\n",
      "chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure\n",
      "passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could\n",
      "have destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not\n",
      "doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the\n",
      "fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for\n",
      "another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly\n",
      "perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the\n",
      "south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still\n",
      "continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I\n",
      "revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:\n",
      "the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of\n",
      "the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had\n",
      "now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and\n",
      "was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a\n",
      "depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not\n",
      "murdered my brother?\n",
      "\n",
      "No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the\n",
      "night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not\n",
      "feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in\n",
      "scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast\n",
      "among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes\n",
      "of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light\n",
      "of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced\n",
      "to destroy all that was dear to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were\n",
      "open, and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to\n",
      "discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\n",
      "made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A\n",
      "being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\n",
      "midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I\n",
      "remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at\n",
      "the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of\n",
      "delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that\n",
      "if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have\n",
      "looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature\n",
      "of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited\n",
      "as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would\n",
      "be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the\n",
      "overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and\n",
      "I resolved to remain silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I\n",
      "told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library\n",
      "to attend their usual hour of rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\n",
      "stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my\n",
      "departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained\n",
      "to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the\n",
      "mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s\n",
      "desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling\n",
      "by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;\n",
      "but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the\n",
      "sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my\n",
      "tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest\n",
      "entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:\n",
      "“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you\n",
      "had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and\n",
      "delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can\n",
      "alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems\n",
      "sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor\n",
      "Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor\n",
      "William! he was our darling and our pride!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal\n",
      "agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the\n",
      "wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and\n",
      "a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more\n",
      "minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused\n",
      "herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her\n",
      "very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt\n",
      "to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the\n",
      "winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he\n",
      "was free last night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of\n",
      "wonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No\n",
      "one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be\n",
      "convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit\n",
      "that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,\n",
      "could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is\n",
      "wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have\n",
      "almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so\n",
      "confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,\n",
      "leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will\n",
      "then hear all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William\n",
      "had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her\n",
      "bed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants,\n",
      "happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the\n",
      "murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which\n",
      "had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant\n",
      "instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to\n",
      "any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,\n",
      "Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl\n",
      "confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied\n",
      "earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,\n",
      "good Justine, is innocent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed\n",
      "on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,\n",
      "after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced\n",
      "some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,\n",
      "“Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of\n",
      "poor William.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had\n",
      "rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much\n",
      "depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be\n",
      "tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that\n",
      "Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I\n",
      "had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be\n",
      "brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to\n",
      "announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as\n",
      "madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the\n",
      "creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the\n",
      "existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance\n",
      "which I had let loose upon the world?\n",
      "\n",
      "We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last\n",
      "beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of\n",
      "her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but\n",
      "it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.\n",
      "She welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear\n",
      "cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some\n",
      "means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she\n",
      "be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do\n",
      "upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only\n",
      "lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely\n",
      "love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I\n",
      "never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not;\n",
      "and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little\n",
      "William.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall\n",
      "be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance\n",
      "of her acquittal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,\n",
      "and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to\n",
      "see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me\n",
      "hopeless and despairing.” She wept.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she\n",
      "is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the\n",
      "activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of\n",
      "partiality.”\n",

      "We passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to\n",
      "commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\n",
      "as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of\n",
      "this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to\n",
      "be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\n",
      "cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of\n",
      "innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\n",
      "aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\n",
      "Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised\n",
      "to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an\n",
      "ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I\n",
      "have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\n",
      "was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have\n",
      "been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have\n",
      "exculpated her who suffered through me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and\n",
      "her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\n",
      "feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in\n",
      "innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\n",
      "thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\n",
      "excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\n",
      "imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She\n",
      "was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as\n",
      "her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\n",
      "worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the\n",
      "court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were\n",
      "seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly\n",
      "recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest\n",
      "her utter guiltlessness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the\n",
      "charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined\n",
      "against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof\n",
      "of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on\n",
      "which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been\n",
      "perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the\n",
      "murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she\n",
      "did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused\n",
      "and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight\n",
      "o’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\n",
      "replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly\n",
      "if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she\n",
      "fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The\n",
      "picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;\n",
      "and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same\n",
      "which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round\n",
      "his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her\n",
      "countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly\n",
      "expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was\n",
      "desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible\n",
      "although variable voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I\n",
      "do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence\n",
      "on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced\n",
      "against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my\n",
      "judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears\n",
      "doubtful or suspicious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed\n",
      "the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the\n",
      "house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from\n",
      "Geneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked\n",
      "her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was\n",
      "alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,\n",
      "when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain\n",
      "several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being\n",
      "unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most\n",
      "of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that\n",
      "she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.\n",
      "It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour\n",
      "to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,\n",
      "it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when\n",
      "questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed\n",
      "a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.\n",
      "Concerning the picture she could give no account.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and\n",
      "fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of\n",
      "explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left\n",
      "to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been\n",
      "placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no\n",
      "enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me\n",
      "wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity\n",
      "afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the\n",
      "jewel, to part with it again so soon?\n",
      "\n",
      "“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for\n",
      "hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my\n",
      "character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed\n",
      "guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my\n",
      "innocence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and\n",
      "they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they\n",
      "supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come\n",
      "forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent\n",
      "dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,\n",
      "when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address\n",
      "the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who\n",
      "was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived\n",
      "with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may\n",
      "therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but\n",
      "when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her\n",
      "pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I\n",
      "know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived\n",
      "in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly\n",
      "two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and\n",
      "benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in\n",
      "her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards\n",
      "attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited\n",
      "the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my\n",
      "uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was\n",
      "warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a\n",
      "most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,\n",
      "notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely\n",
      "on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to\n",
      "the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,\n",
      "I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value\n",

      "minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have\n",
      "betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the\n",
      "horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and\n",
      "the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,\n",
      "I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did\n",

      "condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,\n",
      "until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I\n",

      "Who dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass\n",
      "the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such\n",
      "deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,\n",
      "uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When\n",
      "she saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very\n",
      "kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more\n",

      "never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or\n",
      "consolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was\n",
      "the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair\n",
      "moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and\n",
      "despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within\n",
      "me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with\n",

      "avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the\n",
      "accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,\n",
      "was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in\n",

      "diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the\n",
      "last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,\n",
      "waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I\n",
      "had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the\n",
      "unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,\n",

      "and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.\n",
      "It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the\n",

      "the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie\n",
      "broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,\n",
      "leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon\n",
      "other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines\n",
      "of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is\n",
      "particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking\n",
      "in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\n",
      "destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or\n",
      "luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.\n",
      "I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers\n",
      "which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite\n",
      "mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain\n",

      "received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of\n",

      "uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and\n",
      "interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a\n",

      "before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,\n",
      "“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow\n",

      "the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found\n",
      "some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and\n",
      "tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I\n",
      "tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on\n",
      "the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this\n",
      "operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day\n",
      "searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When\n",
      "I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto\n",
      "inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be\n",
      "more easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the\n",
      "loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how\n",
      "to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of\n",
      "this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply\n",
      "it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood\n",
      "towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at\n",
      "length discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken\n",
      "place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the\n",
      "appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold\n",
      "damp substance that covered the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and\n",
      "shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which\n",
      "had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This\n",
      "was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great\n",
      "curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it,\n",
      "near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on\n",
      "hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the\n",
      "hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form\n",
      "hardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever\n",
      "before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted\n",
      "by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not\n",
      "penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite\n",
      "and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell\n",
      "after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the\n",
      "remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,\n",
      "milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by\n",
      "fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which\n",
      "shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my\n",
      "travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a\n",
      "wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until\n",
      "at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The\n",
      "huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by\n",
      "turns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw\n",
      "placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One\n",
      "of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within\n",
      "the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.\n",
      "The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,\n",
      "grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\n",
      "escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,\n",
      "quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had\n",
      "beheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat\n",
      "and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I\n",
      "dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so\n",
      "low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however,\n",
      "was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\n",
      "although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an\n",
      "agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,\n",
      "however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more\n",
      "from the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my\n",
      "kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could\n",
      "remain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back\n",
      "of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig\n",
      "sty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had\n",
      "crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived\n",
      "with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on\n",
      "occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and\n",
      "that was sufficient for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I\n",
      "retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered\n",
      "too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I\n",
      "had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf\n",
      "of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink\n",
      "more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by\n",
      "my retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept\n",
      "perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was\n",
      "tolerably warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until\n",
      "something should occur which might alter my determination. It was\n",
      "indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,\n",
      "the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with\n",
      "pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\n",
      "water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld\n",
      "a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The\n",
      "girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\n",
      "cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a\n",
      "coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair\n",
      "hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost\n",
      "sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing\n",
      "the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,\n",
      "seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose\n",
      "countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with\n",
      "an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the\n",
      "cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw\n",
      "the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field\n",
      "behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the\n",
      "house and sometimes in the yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the\n",
      "cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been\n",
      "filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost\n",
      "imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.\n",
      "Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean\n",
      "but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an\n",
      "old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The\n",
      "young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she\n",
      "took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat\n",
      "down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play\n",
      "and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the\n",
      "nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had\n",
      "never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent\n",
      "countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle\n",
      "manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air\n",
      "which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of\n",
      "which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then\n",
      "pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt\n",
      "at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection\n",
      "that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were\n",
      "a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,\n",
      "either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the\n",
      "window, unable to bear these emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a\n",
      "load of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of\n",
      "his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on\n",
      "the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,\n",
      "and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed\n",
      "pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she\n",
      "placed in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her\n",
      "work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily\n",
      "employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed\n",
      "thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the\n",
      "cottage together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance\n",
      "of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to\n",
      "eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again\n",
      "occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the\n",
      "cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.\n",
      "Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent\n",
      "creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming\n",
      "with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his\n",
      "figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his\n",
      "eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The\n",
      "old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different\n",
      "from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the\n",
      "fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the\n",
      "cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was\n",
      "delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the\n",
      "pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening\n",
      "the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations\n",
      "which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the\n",
      "instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in\n",
      "the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,\n",
      "but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the\n",
      "harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since\n",
      "found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the\n",
      "science of words or letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,\n",
      "extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.”\n",

      "“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the\n",
      "occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners\n",
      "of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I\n",
      "remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from\n",
      "the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I\n",

      "\n",
      "“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.\n",
      "The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in\n",
      "various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon\n",
      "perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or\n",
      "in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the\n",
      "younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They\n",
      "performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with\n",
      "gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often\n",
      "went apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness,\n",
      "but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were\n",
      "miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,\n",
      "should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They\n",
      "possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every\n",
      "luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands\n",
      "when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,\n",
      "they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day\n",
      "looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they\n",
      "really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions,\n",
      "but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which\n",
      "were at first enigmatic.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of\n",
      "the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they\n",
      "suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment\n",
      "consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of\n",
      "one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters\n",
      "could scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe,\n",
      "suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two\n",
      "younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old\n",
      "man when they reserved none for themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed,\n",
      "during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own\n",
      "consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on\n",
      "the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and\n",
      "roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist\n",
      "their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day\n",
      "in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often\n",
      "took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home\n",
      "firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she\n",
      "opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great\n",
      "pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the\n",
      "youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,\n",
      "that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the\n",
      "cottage and cultivating the garden.\n",

      "“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that\n",
      "these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and\n",
      "feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words\n",
      "they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the\n",
      "minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,\n",
      "and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in\n",
      "every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and\n",
      "the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible\n",
      "objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the\n",
      "mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having\n",
      "remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I\n",
      "discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of\n",
      "discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and\n",
      "_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth\n",
      "and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only\n",
      "one, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or\n",
      "_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot\n",
      "describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of\n",
      "these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other\n",
      "words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,\n",
      "dearest, unhappy._\n",
      "\n",
      "“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of\n",
      "the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I\n",
      "felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw\n",
      "few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the\n",
      "cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the\n",
      "superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,\n",
      "often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that\n",
      "he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a\n",
      "cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure\n",
      "even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled\n",
      "with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I\n",
      "generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\n",
      "having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus\n",
      "with Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my\n",
      "unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his\n",
      "friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more\n",
      "cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old\n",
      "man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked\n",
      "the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty\n",

      "white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in\n",
      "the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that\n",
      "obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and\n",
      "brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual\n",
      "astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible\n",
      "hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring\n",
      "farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,\n",
      "yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden,\n",
      "but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old\n",
      "man and Agatha.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I\n",
      "discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when\n",
      "he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs\n",
      "for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend\n",
      "these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand\n",
      "the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however,\n",
      "sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of\n",
      "conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I\n",
      "easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to\n",

      "in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that\n",
      "it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became\n",
      "fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was\n",
      "filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.\n",
      "Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable\n",

      "vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this\n",
      "time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of\n",
      "impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was\n",
      "coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.\n",
      "Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they\n",
      "dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season\n",
      "advanced.\n",

      "“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did\n",
      "not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its\n",

      "earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.\n",

      "“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I\n",
      "attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in\n",

      "eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I\n",

      "did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness\n",
      "through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the\n",
      "morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of\n",

      "came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,\n",
      "expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I\n",
      "found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger\n",
      "repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;\n",
      "and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the\n",
      "same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty\n",

      "by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely\n",

      "and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave\n",
      "me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different\n",

      "principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and\n",
      "godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour\n",
      "that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on\n",
      "record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more\n",
      "abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I\n",
      "could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or\n",

      "poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the\n",
      "possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and\n",
      "unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with\n",
      "only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,\n",
      "except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to\n",
      "waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of\n",
      "my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I\n",
      "possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,\n",
      "endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even\n",
      "of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could\n",
      "subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with\n",
      "less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked\n",

      "through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and\n",
      "unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of\n",

      "the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and\n",
      "some books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. \n",
      "Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I\n",
      "had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume\n",
      "of _Plutarch’s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The\n",
      "possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually\n",
      "studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were\n",
      "employed in their ordinary occupations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced\n",
      "in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me\n",
      "to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In\n",
      "the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting\n",
      "story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon\n",
      "what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a\n",
      "never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and\n",
      "domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and\n",
      "feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded\n",
      "well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which\n",
      "were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a\n",
      "more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character\n",
      "contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon\n",
      "death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not\n",
      "pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards\n",
      "the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely\n",
      "understanding it.\n",

      "“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and\n",
      "condition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely\n",
      "unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I\n",
      "was a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I\n",
      "was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.\n",
      "‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my\n",
      "annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did\n",
      "this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my\n",

      "\n",
      "“The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained the\n",
      "histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book\n",
      "had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I\n",
      "learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch\n",
      "taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my\n",
      "own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many\n",
      "things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very\n",
      "confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,\n",
      "and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and\n",
      "large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the\n",
      "only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book\n",
      "developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned\n",
      "in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the\n",
      "greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as\n",
      "far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they\n",
      "were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these\n",
      "feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,\n",
      "Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The\n",
      "patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a\n",
      "firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had\n",
      "been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should\n",
      "have been imbued with different sensations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I read\n",
      "it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as\n",
      "a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the\n",
      "picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of\n",
      "exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity\n",
      "struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to\n",
      "any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine\n",
      "in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a\n",
      "perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of\n",
      "his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from\n",
      "beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.\n",
      "Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for\n",
      "often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter\n",
      "gall of envy rose within me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon\n",
      "after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of\n",
      "the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had\n",
      "neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in\n",
      "which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was\n",
      "your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You\n",
      "minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress\n",
      "of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic\n",
      "occurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.\n",
      "Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed\n",
      "origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances\n",
      "which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious\n",
      "and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own\n",
      "horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful\n",
      "day when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed creator!\n",
      "Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in\n",
      "disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own\n",
      "image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the\n",
      "very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire\n",
      "and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;\n",
      "but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and\n",
      "benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should\n",
      "become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would\n",
      "compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn\n",
      "from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion\n",
      "and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way\n",
      "to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I\n",
      "postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance\n",
      "attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.\n",
      "Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every\n",
      "day’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking\n",
      "until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The\n",
      "presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also\n",
      "found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha\n",
      "spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in\n",
      "their labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were\n",
      "contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while\n",
      "mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only\n",
      "discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I\n",
      "cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person\n",
      "reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail\n",
      "image and that inconstant shade.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial\n",
      "which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my\n",
      "thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and\n",
      "dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my\n",
      "feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed\n",
      "smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my\n",
      "sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam’s\n",
      "supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,\n",
      "and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay\n",
      "and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it\n",
      "had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did\n",
      "not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my\n",
      "conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief\n",
      "delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay\n",
      "apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention\n",
      "towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the\n",
      "absence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and\n",
      "their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the\n",
      "casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the\n",
      "greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my\n",
      "heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see\n",
      "their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost\n",
      "limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from\n",
      "me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were\n",
      "never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a\n",
      "little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not\n",
      "believe myself utterly unworthy of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken\n",
      "place since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely\n",
      "directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my\n",
      "protectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally\n",
      "fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.\n",
      "I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my\n",
      "person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly\n",
      "beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I\n",
      "thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain\n",
      "the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means\n",
      "be tolerated by my younger protectors.\n",

      "and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,\n",
      "and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own\n",
      "desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,\n",
      "he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more\n",
      "sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his\n",
      "countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,\n",
      "thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the\n",
      "instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.\n",

      "“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which\n",
      "would decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a\n",
      "neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an\n",
      "excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my\n",
      "limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting\n",
      "all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had\n",
      "placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived\n",
      "me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their\n",

      "“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound\n",
      "sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by\n",
      "peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever\n",
      "acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix\n",
      "tearing me from his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that\n",
      "it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in\n",
      "search of food.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the\n",
      "well-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace.\n",
      "I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the\n",
      "accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun\n",
      "mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I\n",
      "trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside\n",
      "of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the\n",
      "agony of this suspense.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they\n",
      "entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not\n",
      "understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,\n",
      "which differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix\n",
      "approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not\n",
      "quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from\n",
      "his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him,\n",
      "‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose\n",
      "the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and\n",
      "I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your\n",

      "\n",
      "“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can\n",
      "never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest\n",
      "danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and\n",
      "my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason\n",

      "“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion\n",
      "entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then\n",
      "departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of\n",
      "utter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken\n",
      "the only link that held me to the world. For the first time the\n",
      "feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to\n",
      "control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I\n",
      "bent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends,\n",
      "of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the\n",
      "exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of\n",
      "tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had\n",
      "spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to\n",
      "injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As\n",
      "night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,\n",
      "and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,\n",
      "I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\n",
      "operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly\n",
      "dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore\n",
      "along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my\n",
      "spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the\n",
      "dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,\n",
      "my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon\n",
      "nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my\n",
      "brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,\n",
      "and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the\n",
      "cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and\n",
      "licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of\n",
      "the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I\n",
      "resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated\n",
      "and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the\n",
      "thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you\n",
      "were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness\n",
      "than to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had\n",
      "bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from\n",
      "these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.\n",
      "You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards\n",
      "this place I resolved to proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a\n",
      "southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my\n",
      "only guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass\n",
      "through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I\n",
      "did not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although\n",
      "towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,\n",
      "heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions\n",
      "and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.\n",
      "But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I\n",
      "determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from\n",
      "any other being that wore the human form.\n",

      "“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was\n",
      "late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.\n",
      "I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a\n",
      "human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;\n",
      "rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface\n",
      "of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,\n",
      "earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The\n",
      "mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall\n",
      "and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more\n",
      "deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow\n",
      "fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents\n",
      "now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I\n",
      "often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me\n",
      "no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could\n",
      "not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived\n",
      "on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth\n",
      "and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial\n",
      "manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was\n",
      "secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding\n",
      "that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey\n",
      "after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,\n",
      "cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of\n",
      "the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long\n",
      "appeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of\n",
      "these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and\n",
      "forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears\n",
      "again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with\n",
      "thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its\n",
      "boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many\n",
      "of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.\n",
      "Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard\n",
      "the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade\n",
      "of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running\n",
      "towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from\n",
      "someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides\n",
      "of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the\n",
      "rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,\n",
      "from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She\n",
      "was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore\n",
      "animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,\n",
      "who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On\n",
      "seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,\n",
      "hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I\n",
      "hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,\n",
      "which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my\n",
      "injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being\n",
      "from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable\n",
      "pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of\n",
      "kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments\n",
      "before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by\n",
      "pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the\n",
      "agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to\n",
      "cure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,\n",
      "and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any\n",
      "rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented\n",
      "also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their\n",
      "infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,\n",
      "such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had\n",
      "endured.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The\n",
      "labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or\n",
      "gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my\n",
      "desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for\n",
      "the enjoyment of pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I\n",
      "reached the environs of Geneva.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among\n",
      "the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply\n",
      "to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to\n",
      "enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting\n",
      "behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,\n",
      "which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came\n",
      "running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of\n",
      "infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this\n",
      "little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have\n",
      "imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and\n",
      "educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in\n",
      "this peopled earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him\n",
      "towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before\n",
      "his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his\n",
      "face and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to\n",
      "hurt you; listen to me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried;\n",
      "‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You\n",
      "are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M.\n",
      "Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have\n",
      "sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried\n",
      "despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a\n",
      "moment he lay dead at my feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish\n",
      "triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation;\n",
      "my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and\n",
      "a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his\n",
      "breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite\n",
      "of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I\n",
      "gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her\n",
      "lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was\n",
      "for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could\n",
      "bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in\n",
      "regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one\n",
      "expressive of disgust and affright.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only\n",
      "wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in\n",
      "exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the\n",
      "attempt to destroy them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had\n",
      "committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I\n",
      "entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was\n",
      "sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her\n",
      "whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the\n",
      "loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose\n",
      "joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over\n",
      "her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would\n",
      "give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my\n",
      "beloved, awake!’\n",
      "\n",
      "“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she\n",
      "indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus\n",
      "would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.\n",
      "The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but\n",
      "she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever\n",
      "robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had\n",
      "its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of\n",
      "Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work\n",
      "mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of\n",
      "the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,\n",
      "sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and\n",

      "and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning\n",
      "passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have\n",
      "promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man\n",
      "will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself\n",

      "clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I\n",
      "urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to\n",
      "comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that\n",
      "resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find\n",

      "previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,\n",
      "arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered\n",
      "with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the\n",

      "unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my\n",
      "departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and\n",
      "would he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in\n",
      "itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.\n",
      "I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of\n",
      "this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the\n",
      "slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of\n",
      "the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend\n",

      "It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native\n",
      "country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth\n",

      "my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had\n",
      "been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man\n",
      "is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s\n",
      "sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand\n",
      "conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent\n",
      "farewell.\n",

      "I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly\n",
      "knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.\n",
      "I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on\n",
      "it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with\n",
      "me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful\n",
      "and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could\n",

      "was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the\n",
      "setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new\n",
      "day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and\n",
      "the appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried;\n",
      "“now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are\n",
      "you desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy\n",

      "sunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more\n",
      "amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an\n",
      "eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a\n",

      "between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw\n",
      "many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by\n",
      "black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,\n",
      "presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view\n",
      "rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with\n",
      "the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,\n",
      "flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river\n",

      "bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to\n",
      "drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these\n",
      "were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had\n",

      "occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the\n",

      "If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,\n",

      "instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long\n",

      "in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had\n",
      "taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of\n",
      "European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the\n",
      "execution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his\n",
      "enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this\n",
      "as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures\n",
      "natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by\n",
      "any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,\n",
      "alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also\n",
      "began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this\n",
      "was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling\n",
      "on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme\n",

      "After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in\n",

      "We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now\n",
      "February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the\n",

      "intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,\n",
      "Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of\n",
      "this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and\n",
      "the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some\n",
      "obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.\n",
      "\n",
      "We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at\n",
      "Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us\n",
      "mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of\n",
      "stately deer were all novelties to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds\n",
      "were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted\n",
      "there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles\n",
      "I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,\n",
      "after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of\n",
      "Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his\n",
      "companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and\n",
      "son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they\n",
      "might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a\n",
      "dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these\n",
      "feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of\n",
      "the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.\n",
      "The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\n",
      "magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows\n",
      "of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,\n",
      "which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and\n",
      "domes, embosomed among aged trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\n",
      "memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed\n",
      "for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never\n",
      "visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what\n",
      "is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in\n",
      "the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate\n",
      "elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has\n",
      "entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what\n",
      "I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,\n",
      "pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs\n",
      "and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most\n",
      "animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery\n",
      "were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\n",
      "themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the\n",
      "field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated\n",
      "from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas\n",
      "of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments\n",
      "and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains\n",
      "and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten\n",
      "into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my\n",
      "miserable self.\n",
      "\n",
      "We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next\n",
      "place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village\n",
      "resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but\n",
      "everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of\n",
      "distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my\n",
      "native country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets\n",
      "of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same\n",
      "manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name\n",
      "made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit\n",
      "Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in\n",
      "Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the\n",
      "Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the\n",
      "northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the\n",
      "rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we\n",
      "made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into\n",
      "happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than\n",
      "mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found\n",
      "in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\n",
      "imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his\n",
      "inferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among\n",
      "these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain\n",
      "amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and\n",
      "when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\n",
      "that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\n",
      "engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland\n",
      "and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period\n",
      "of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them\n",
      "to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my\n",
      "promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s\n",
      "disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance\n",
      "on my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment\n",
      "from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited\n",
      "for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was\n",
      "miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I\n",
      "saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to\n",
      "read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend\n",
      "followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.\n",
      "When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,\n",
      "but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of\n",
      "his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the\n",
      "consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed\n",
      "drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might\n",
      "have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well\n",
      "as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.\n",
      "But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic\n",
      "castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s\n",
      "Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for\n",
      "the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was\n",
      "impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and\n",
      "along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.\n",
      "But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into\n",
      "their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and\n",
      "accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland\n",
      "alone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our\n",
      "rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with\n",
      "my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short\n",
      "time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\n",
      "congenial to your own temper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\n",
      "remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with\n",
      "you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch\n",
      "people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,\n",
      "that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in\n",
      "your absence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of\n",

      "monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have\n",
      "finished, that he might receive his companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of\n",
      "the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place\n",
      "fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were\n",
      "continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely\n",
      "affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its\n",
      "inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs\n",
      "gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they\n",
      "indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from\n",
      "the mainland, which was about five miles distant.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of\n",
      "these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two\n",
      "rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable\n",
      "penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the\n",
      "door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some\n",
      "furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have\n",
      "occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been\n",
      "benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at\n",
      "and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes\n",
      "which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations\n",
      "of men.\n",

      "In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,\n",
      "when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to\n",
      "listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a\n",
      "monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was\n",
      "far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills\n",
      "are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the\n",
      "plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when\n",
      "troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively\n",
      "infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.\n",

      "In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but\n",
      "as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and\n",
      "irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my\n",
      "laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night\n",
      "in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in\n",
      "which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of\n",
      "enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my\n",
      "mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes\n",

      "Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in\n",
      "a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from\n",

      "grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my\n",
      "persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing\n",
      "to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much\n",

      "by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by\n",
      "his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my\n",
      "promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me\n",
      "as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at\n",
      "the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.\n",
      "\n",
      "I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by\n",
      "the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin\n",
      "wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task\n",
      "which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he\n",
      "had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide\n",
      "and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the\n",
      "fulfilment of my promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of\n",
      "malice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my\n",
      "promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,\n",
      "tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me\n",
      "destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for\n",
      "happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.\n",
      "\n",
      "I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own\n",
      "heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I\n",
      "sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate\n",
      "the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most\n",
      "terrible reveries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;\n",
      "it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature\n",
      "reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone\n",
      "specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound\n",
      "of voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,\n",
      "although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear\n",
      "was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a\n",
      "person landed close to my house.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one\n",
      "endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a\n",
      "presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who\n",
      "dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation\n",
      "of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain\n",
      "endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door\n",
      "opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he\n",
      "approached me and said in a smothered voice,\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you\n",
      "intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;\n",
      "I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among\n",
      "its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many\n",
      "months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have\n",
      "endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my\n",
      "hopes?”\n",

      "“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like\n",
      "yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself\n",
      "unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe\n",
      "yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of\n",
      "day will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;\n",
      "obey!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is\n",
      "arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but\n",
      "they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in\n",
      "vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose\n",
      "delight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your\n",
      "words will only exasperate my rage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the\n",
      "impotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a\n",
      "wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had\n",
      "feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.\n",
      "Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,\n",
      "and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for\n",
      "ever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my\n",
      "wretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge\n",
      "remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but\n",
      "first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your\n",
      "misery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with\n",
      "the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall\n",
      "repent of the injuries you inflict.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.\n",

      "I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with\n",
      "precipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot\n",
      "across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the\n",
      "waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to\n",
      "pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I\n",
      "walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination\n",
      "conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not\n",
      "followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him\n",
      "to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered\n",
      "to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.\n",
      "And then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you on\n",
      "your wedding-night._” That, then, was the period fixed for the\n",
      "fulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and\n",
      "extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I\n",
      "thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she\n",
      "should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I\n",
      "had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall\n",
      "before my enemy without a bitter struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became\n",
      "calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into\n",
      "the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last\n",
      "night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I\n",
      "almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow\n",
      "creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I\n",
      "desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,\n",
      "but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to\n",
      "be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a\n",
      "dæmon whom I had myself created.\n",
      "\n",
      "I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it\n",
      "loved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the\n",
      "sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep\n",
      "sleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves\n",
      "were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep\n",
      "into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as\n",
      "if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to\n",
      "reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the\n",
      "words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared\n",
      "like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\n",
      "appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\n",
      "fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;\n",
      "it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to\n",
      "join him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where\n",
      "he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired\n",
      "his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his\n",
      "Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as\n",
      "his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now\n",
      "conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of\n",
      "my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to\n",
      "leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed\n",
      "southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and\n",
      "I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered\n",
      "to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I\n",
      "must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must\n",
      "handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next\n",
      "morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door\n",
      "of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had\n",
      "destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had\n",
      "mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and\n",
      "then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments\n",
      "out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my\n",
      "work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly\n",
      "put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them\n",
      "up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the\n",
      "meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my\n",
      "chemical apparatus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\n",
      "in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had\n",
      "before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with\n",
      "whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film\n",
      "had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw\n",
      "clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\n",
      "to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\n",
      "reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in\n",
      "my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made\n",
      "would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I\n",
      "banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\n",
      "conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\n",
      "basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.\n",
      "The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,\n",
      "but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a\n",
      "dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my\n",
      "fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was\n",
      "suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of\n",
      "darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound\n",
      "as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but\n",
      "the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then\n",
      "rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations\n",
      "that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a\n",
      "direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the\n",
      "moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its\n",
      "keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I\n",
      "slept soundly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I\n",
      "found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and\n",
      "the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found\n",
      "that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from\n",
      "which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\n",
      "that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with\n",
      "water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I\n",
      "confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me\n",
      "and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the\n",
      "world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the\n",
      "wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in\n",
      "the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already\n",
      "been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to\n",
      "my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\n",
      "that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the\n",
      "sea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your\n",
      "task is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and\n",
      "of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his\n",
      "sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so\n",
      "despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of\n",
      "closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\n",
      "horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became\n",
      "free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick\n",
      "and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high\n",
      "land towards the south.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured\n",
      "for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of\n",
      "warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have\n",
      "of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a\n",
      "part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a\n",
      "wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived\n",
      "the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself\n",
      "suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I\n",
      "carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at\n",
      "length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of\n",
      "extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place\n",
      "where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with\n",
      "me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good\n",
      "harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected\n",
      "escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\n",
      "people crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my\n",
      "appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\n",
      "together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\n",
      "a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they\n",
      "spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “My\n",
      "good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of\n",
      "this town and inform me where I am?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.\n",
      "“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,\n",
      "but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\n",
      "stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\n",
      "angry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so\n",
      "roughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to\n",
      "receive strangers so inhospitably.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the\n",
      "English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\n",
      "increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\n",
      "annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but\n",
      "no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the\n",
      "crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man\n",
      "approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must\n",
      "follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not\n",
      "this a free country?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,\n",
      "and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was\n",
      "found murdered here last night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;\n",
      "that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence\n",
      "and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from\n",
      "fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic\n",
      "to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into\n",
      "apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that\n",
      "was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair\n",
      "all fear of ignominy or death.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of\n",
      "the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my\n",
      "recollection.\n",

      "I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old\n",
      "benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,\n",
      "with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,\n",
      "he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\n",
      "magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with\n",
      "his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,\n",
      "they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in\n",
      "for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did\n",
      "not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about\n",
      "two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,\n",
      "and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding\n",
      "along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his\n",
      "length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the\n",
      "light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,\n",
      "who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the\n",
      "corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the\n",
      "waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even\n",
      "that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage\n",
      "of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it\n",
      "to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty\n",
      "years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of\n",
      "any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but\n",
      "when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of\n",
      "my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\n",
      "mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\n",
      "support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew\n",
      "an unfavourable augury from my manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was\n",
      "called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he\n",
      "saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;\n",
      "and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same\n",
      "boat in which I had just landed.\n",

      "A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door\n",
      "of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour\n",
      "before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with\n",
      "only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse\n",
      "was afterwards found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\n",
      "body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and\n",

      "Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed\n",
      "that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\n",
      "was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been\n",
      "obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.\n",
      "Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body\n",
      "from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know\n",
      "the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance\n",
      "of the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into\n",
      "the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what\n",
      "effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably\n",
      "suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the\n",
      "murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate\n",
      "and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the\n",
      "strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,\n",
      "knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had\n",
      "inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly\n",
      "tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How\n",
      "can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with\n",
      "horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and\n",
      "agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\n",
      "passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry\n",
      "Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on\n",
      "the body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you\n",
      "also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other\n",
      "victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my\n",
      "benefactor—”\n",
      "\n",
      "The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and\n",
      "I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my\n",
      "ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\n",
      "murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my\n",
      "attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\n",
      "tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\n",
      "my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke\n",
      "my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\n",
      "bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not\n",
      "sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming\n",
      "children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and\n",
      "youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the\n",
      "next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I\n",
      "made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of\n",
      "the wheel, continually renewed the torture?\n",
      "\n",
      "But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from\n",
      "a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\n",
      "gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\n",
      "It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had\n",
      "forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\n",
      "great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around\n",
      "and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I\n",
      "was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\n",
      "me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\n",
      "countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\n",
      "that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\n",
      "persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her\n",
      "tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,\n",
      "and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you better now, sir?” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;\n",
      "but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am\n",
      "still alive to feel this misery and horror.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the\n",
      "gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\n",
      "were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none\n",
      "of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty\n",
      "with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\n",
      "speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt\n",
      "languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series\n",
      "of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\n",
      "were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\n",
      "of reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\n",
      "feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\n",
      "me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The\n",
      "physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\n",
      "them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\n",
      "expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\n",
      "second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\n",
      "hangman who would gain his fee?\n",
      "\n",
      "These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had\n",
      "shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison\n",
      "to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\n",
      "had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to\n",
      "see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\n",
      "every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\n",
      "miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see\n",
      "that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\n",
      "intervals.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes\n",
      "half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom\n",
      "and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to\n",
      "remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I\n",
      "considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\n",
      "penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my\n",
      "thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.\n",
      "His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to\n",
      "mine and addressed me in French,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to\n",
      "make you more comfortable?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole\n",
      "earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\n",
      "one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I\n",
      "hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can\n",
      "easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become\n",
      "the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and\n",
      "have been, can death be any evil to me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\n",
      "strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some\n",
      "surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\n",
      "seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was\n",
      "presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so\n",
      "unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across\n",
      "your path.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on\n",
      "this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at\n",
      "the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some\n",
      "astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened\n",
      "to say,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on\n",
      "your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some\n",
      "trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune\n",
      "and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I\n",
      "discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote\n",
      "to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\n",
      "But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any\n",
      "kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;\n",
      "tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am\n",
      "now to lament?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with\n",
      "gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it\n",
      "instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\n",
      "misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for\n",
      "me to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,\n",
      "and cried out in agony,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not\n",
      "let him enter!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help\n",
      "regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in\n",
      "rather a severe tone,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\n",
      "would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\n",
      "from anguish to pleasure. “Is my father indeed come? How kind, how\n",
      "very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he\n",
      "thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,\n",
      "and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and\n",
      "quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the\n",
      "arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by\n",
      "dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\n",
      "desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of\n",
      "cheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”\n",
      "said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance\n",
      "of the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems\n",
      "to pursue you. And poor Clerval—”\n",
      "\n",
      "The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too\n",
      "great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the\n",
      "most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I\n",
      "should have died on the coffin of Henry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\n",
      "precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\n",
      "could ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my\n",
      "strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the\n",
      "appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\n",
      "gradually recovered my health.\n",
      "\n",
      "As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\n",
      "melancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was\n",
      "for ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation\n",
      "into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\n",
      "relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a\n",
      "life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now\n",
      "drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these\n",
      "throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears\n",
      "me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also\n",
      "sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the\n",
      "wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours\n",
      "motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that\n",
      "might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.\n",
      "\n",
      "The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months\n",
      "in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a\n",
      "relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country\n",
      "town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every\n",
      "care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared\n",
      "the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not\n",
      "brought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand\n",
      "jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney\n",
      "Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight\n",
      "after my removal I was liberated from prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\n",
      "criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\n",
      "atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not\n",
      "participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\n",
      "palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and\n",
      "although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I\n",
      "saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\n",
      "no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes\n",
      "they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark\n",
      "orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed\n",
      "them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I\n",
      "first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked\n",
      "of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but\n",
      "these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a\n",
      "wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved\n",
      "cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more\n",
      "the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\n",
      "childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a\n",
      "prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\n",
      "these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\n",
      "despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the\n",
      "existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\n",
      "to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally\n",
      "triumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should\n",
      "return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those\n",
      "I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any\n",
      "chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to\n",
      "blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to\n",
      "the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the\n",
      "mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to\n",
      "delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a\n",
      "journey, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My\n",
      "strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day\n",
      "preyed upon my wasted frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,\n",
      "my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel\n",
      "bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.\n",
      "It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to\n",
      "the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my\n",
      "sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should\n",
      "soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;\n",
      "yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested\n",
      "shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly\n",
      "that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\n",
      "companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I\n",
      "repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\n",
      "with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\n",
      "Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on\n",
      "to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in\n",
      "which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a\n",
      "thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking\n",
      "every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug\n",
      "only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of\n",
      "life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now\n",
      "swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did\n",
      "not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a\n",
      "thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind\n",
      "of nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free\n",
      "myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was\n",
      "watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves\n",
      "were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of\n",
      "security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour\n",
      "and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm\n",
      "forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly\n",

      "countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer\n",
      "eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,\n",
      "not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,\n",
      "that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate\n",
      "into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.\n",

      "into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the\n",
      "decorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part of\n",
      "the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian\n",
      "government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It\n",
      "was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa\n",
      "Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake\n",
      "near which it stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the\n",
      "fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger\n",
      "constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and\n",
      "by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the\n",
      "period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be\n",
      "regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for\n",
      "in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed\n",

      "calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my\n",
      "destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;\n",
      "and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had\n",
      "promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the\n",
      "meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in\n",

      "father’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our\n",

      "voyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable;\n",
      "all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the\n",
      "feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we\n",
      "were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the\n",
      "beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw\n",
      "Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,\n",
      "surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy\n",
      "mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the\n",
      "opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the\n",
      "ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost\n",
      "insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the hand of Elizabeth. “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If\n",

      "painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me\n",
      "not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I\n",
      "will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move\n",
      "along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise\n",
      "above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more\n",
      "interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in\n",

      "conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the\n",

      "motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood\n",

      "breath had ceased to issue from her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.\n",
      "The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of\n",
      "panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.\n",
      "The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be\n",
      "described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.\n",
      "A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his\n",
      "fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards\n",
      "the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,\n",
      "leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,\n",
      "plunged into the lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to\n",
      "the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with\n",
      "boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we\n",
      "returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a\n",
      "form conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to\n",
      "search the country, parties going in different directions among the\n",
      "woods and vines.\n",
      "\n",
      "I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the\n",
      "house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken\n",
      "man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my\n",
      "eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I\n",
      "was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had\n",
      "happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that\n",
      "I had lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room\n",
      "where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I\n",
      "hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no\n",
      "distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to\n",
      "various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their\n",
      "cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death\n",
      "of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly\n",
      "of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining\n",
      "friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now\n",
      "might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his\n",
      "feet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started\n",
      "up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\n",
      "wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was\n",
      "hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men\n",
      "to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from\n",
      "mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,\n",
      "and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any\n",
      "exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way\n",
      "to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were\n",
      "familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day\n",
      "before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.\n",
      "Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw\n",
      "the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had\n",
      "then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as\n",
      "a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,\n",
      "but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had\n",
      "snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been\n",
      "so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of\n",
      "man.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last\n",
      "overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their\n",
      "_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know\n",
      "that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My\n",
      "own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of\n",
      "my hideous narration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk\n",
      "under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old\n",
      "man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their\n",
      "delight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with\n",
      "all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having\n",
      "few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed\n",
      "be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste\n",
      "in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated\n",
      "around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to\n",
      "rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and\n",
      "darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,\n",
      "indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales\n",
      "with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a\n",
      "dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear\n",
      "conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my\n",
      "prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I\n",
      "understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I\n",
      "awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the\n",
      "memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their\n",
      "cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had\n",
      "sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a\n",
      "maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed\n",
      "that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal\n",
      "revenge on his cursed head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to\n",
      "reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about\n",
      "a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town\n",
      "and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the\n",
      "destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole\n",
      "authority for the apprehension of the murderer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be\n",
      "assured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall\n",
      "be spared to discover the villain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the\n",
      "deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I\n",
      "should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth\n",
      "which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to\n",
      "be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My\n",
      "manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my\n",
      "own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose\n",
      "quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related\n",
      "my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with\n",
      "accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued\n",
      "he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with\n",
      "horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted\n",
      "on his countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I\n",

      "whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that\n",
      "your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those\n",
      "functions on this occasion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own\n",
      "auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given\n",
      "to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon\n",
      "to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity\n",
      "returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you\n",
      "every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to\n",
      "have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an\n",
      "animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where\n",
      "no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since\n",
      "the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he\n",
      "has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if\n",
      "he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois\n",
      "and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not\n",
      "credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\n",
      "punishment which is his desert.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.\n",
      "“You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if\n",
      "it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer\n",
      "punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have\n",
      "yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove\n",
      "impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should\n",
      "make up your mind to disappointment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My\n",
      "revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\n",
      "confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage\n",
      "is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned\n",
      "loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have\n",
      "but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to\n",
      "his destruction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy\n",
      "in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness\n",
      "which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan\n",
      "magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of\n",
      "devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of\n",
      "madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and\n",

      "My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was\n",
      "swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone\n",
      "endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and\n",
      "allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise\n",
      "delirium or death would have been my portion.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I\n",
      "was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became\n",
      "hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels\n",
      "which had belonged to my mother, and departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have\n",
      "traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships\n",

      "\n",
      "When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I\n",
      "might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,\n",
      "and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain\n",
      "what path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the\n",
      "entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father\n",
      "reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their\n",
      "graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which\n",
      "were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the\n",
      "scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested\n",
      "observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to\n",
      "cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the\n",
      "mourner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to\n",
      "rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,\n",
      "and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass\n",
      "and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the\n",
      "sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the\n",
      "deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the\n",
      "spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,\n",
      "until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will\n",
      "preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun\n",
      "and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my\n",
      "eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering\n",
      "ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed\n",
      "and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now\n",
      "torments me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me\n",
      "that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but\n",
      "the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish\n",
      "laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed\n",
      "it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.\n",
      "Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have\n",
      "destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I\n",
      "was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known\n",
      "and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an\n",
      "audible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have\n",
      "determined to live, and I am satisfied.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil\n",

      "mortal speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a\n",
      "slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The\n",
      "blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend\n",
      "enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I\n",
      "took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I\n",
      "have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by\n",
      "this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,\n",
      "who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,\n",
      "left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw\n",
      "the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering\n",
      "on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand\n",
      "what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the\n",
      "least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil\n",
      "and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good\n",
      "followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly\n",
      "extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,\n",
      "when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast\n",
      "was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The\n",
      "fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but\n",
      "I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had\n",
      "invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and\n",
      "I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the\n",
      "few drops that revived me, and vanish.\n",
      "\n",
      "I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon\n",
      "generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the\n",
      "country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom\n",
      "seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my\n",
      "path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers\n",
      "by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,\n",
      "which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had\n",
      "provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.\n",
      "\n",
      "My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\n",
      "sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most\n",
      "miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The\n",
      "spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of\n",
      "happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of\n",
      "this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was\n",
      "sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my\n",
      "friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent\n",
      "countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s\n",
      "voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by\n",
      "a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should\n",
      "come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest\n",
      "friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to\n",
      "their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and\n",
      "persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that\n",
      "burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the\n",
      "destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the\n",
      "mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the\n",
      "ardent desire of my soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he\n",
      "left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided\n",
      "me and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet\n",
      "over”—these words were legible in one of these\n",
      "inscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I\n",
      "seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of\n",
      "cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if\n",
      "you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my\n",

      "hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,\n",
      "miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search\n",
      "until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my\n",

      "reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!\n",
      "\n",
      "As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the\n",

      "shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to\n",
      "seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to\n",
      "seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be\n",
      "procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One\n",
      "inscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toils\n",

      "upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting\n",
      "hatred.”\n",

      "My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\n",
      "resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support\n",
      "me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,\n",
      "until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary\n",
      "of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the\n",
      "south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by\n",
      "its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when\n",
      "they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with\n",
      "rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down\n",
      "and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in\n",

      "when I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and\n",
      "I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new\n",
      "courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched\n",
      "hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the\n",
      "fiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,\n",
      "had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,\n",
      "putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of\n",
      "his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter\n",
      "food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a\n",
      "numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same\n",
      "night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his\n",
      "journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they\n",
      "conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the\n",
      "ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.\n",
      "He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless\n",
      "journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few\n",
      "of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a\n",
      "genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea\n",
      "that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance\n",
      "returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.\n",
      "After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered\n",
      "round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of\n",
      "the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I\n",
      "departed from land.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured\n",
      "misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution\n",
      "burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and\n",
      "rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard\n",
      "the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But\n",
      "again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that\n",
      "I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction\n",
      "of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of\n",
      "despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured\n",
      "her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after\n",
      "the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the\n",
      "summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,\n",
      "died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye\n",
      "caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to\n",
      "discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I\n",
      "distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known\n",
      "form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!\n",
      "Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might\n",
      "not intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was\n",
      "dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that\n",
      "oppressed me, I wept aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their\n",

      "irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor\n",
      "did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short\n",
      "time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed\n",
      "perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I\n",
      "beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within\n",
      "me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were\n",
      "suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had\n",
      "ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as\n",
      "the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous\n",
      "and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;\n",
      "and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a\n",
      "tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few\n",
      "minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left\n",
      "drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and\n",
      "thus preparing for me a hideous death.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I\n",

      "I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded\n",
      "at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and\n",
      "by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in\n",
      "the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,\n",
      "still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my\n",
      "purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue\n",

      "\n",
      "Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the\n",

      "proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long\n",
      "locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and\n",
      "apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my\n",
      "approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung\n",
      "towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of\n",
      "such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and\n",
      "endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.\n",

      "\n",
      "He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the\n",
      "lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and\n",
      "every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some\n",
      "uncontrollable passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my\n",
      "crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its\n",
      "close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it\n",
      "avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee\n",

      "me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his\n",
      "enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I\n",
      "approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his\n",
      "face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I\n",
      "attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster\n",
      "continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I\n",
      "gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you\n",
      "had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse\n",

      "“he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the\n",
      "ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the\n",
      "lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me\n",
      "on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the\n",
      "groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be\n",
      "susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice\n",
      "and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without\n",
      "torture such as you cannot even imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken\n",
      "and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I\n",
      "abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of\n",
      "my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for\n",
      "happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me\n",
      "he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the\n",
      "indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter\n",
      "indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I\n",
      "recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I\n",
      "knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the\n",
      "slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not\n",
      "disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had\n",
      "cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my\n",
      "despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no\n",
      "choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly\n",
      "chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable\n",
      "passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called\n",
      "to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and\n",
      "persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my\n",
      "friend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.\n",
      "“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you\n",
      "have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are\n",
      "consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!\n",
      "If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would\n",
      "he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you\n",
      "feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn\n",
      "from your power.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.\n",
      "“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to\n",
      "be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.\n",
      "No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of\n",
      "virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being\n",
      "overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has\n",
      "become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into\n",
      "bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am\n",
      "content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am\n",
      "well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once\n",
      "my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once\n",
      "I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would\n",
      "love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was\n",
      "nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has\n",
      "degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no\n",
      "malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the\n",
      "frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same\n",
      "creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent\n",
      "visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the\n",
      "fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man\n",
      "had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my\n",
      "crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them\n",
      "he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured\n",
      "wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did\n",
      "not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still\n",
      "I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no\n",
      "injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all\n",
      "humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his\n",
      "friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic\n",
      "who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous\n",
      "and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an\n",
      "abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my\n",

      "\n",

      "devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and\n",
      "admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that\n",
      "irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but\n",
      "your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the\n",
      "hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the\n",

      "will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.\n",
      "\n",

      "consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,\n",
      "but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this\n",

      "responsible for this apparent disturbance of an old man's peace of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about\n",
      "five by six inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs,\n",
      "however, were far from modern in atmosphere and suggestion; for,\n",
      "although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and wild, they do\n",
      "not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric\n",
      "writing. And writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed\n",
      "certainly to be; though my memory, despite much familiarity with the\n",
      "papers and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify this\n",
      "particular species, or even hint at its remotest affiliations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial\n",
      "intent, though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear\n",
      "idea of its nature. It seemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol\n",
      "representing a monster, of a form which only a diseased fancy could\n",
      "conceive. If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded\n",
      "simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature,\n",
      "I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A pulpy,\n",
      "tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary\n",
      "wings; but it was the _general outline_ of the whole which made it most\n",
      "shockingly frightful. Behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a\n",
      "Cyclopean architectural background.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of\n",
      "press cuttings, in Professor Angell's most recent hand; and made no\n",

      "headed \"_CTHULHU CULT_\" in characters painstakingly printed to avoid\n",

      "Scott-Eliott's _Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria_), and the rest comments\n",

      "to passages in such mythological and anthropological source-books\n",
      "as Frazer's _Golden Bough_ and Miss Murray's _Witch-Cult in Western\n",

      "The first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar\n",
      "tale. It appears that on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of\n",
      "neurotic and excited aspect had called upon Professor Angell bearing\n",
      "the singular clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly damp and\n",
      "fresh. His card bore the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle\n",
      "had recognized him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly\n",
      "known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at the Rhode\n",
      "Island School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building\n",
      "near that institution. Wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius\n",
      "but great eccentricity, and had from childhood excited attention\n",
      "through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of\n",
      "relating. He called himself \"psychically hypersensitive\", but the staid\n",
      "folk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him as merely \"queer\".\n",
      "Never mingling much with his kind, he had dropped gradually from social\n",
      "visibility, and was now known only to a small group of esthetes from\n",
      "other towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its\n",
      "conservatism, had found him quite hopeless.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the occasion of the visit, ran the professor's manuscript, the\n",
      "sculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host's archeological\n",
      "knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics on the bas-relief. He\n",
      "spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated\n",
      "sympathy; and my uncle showed some sharpness in replying, for the\n",
      "conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but\n",
      "archeology. Young Wilcox's rejoinder, which impressed my uncle enough\n",
      "to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically\n",
      "poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which\n",
      "I have since found highly characteristic of him. He said, \"It is new,\n",
      "indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and\n",
      "dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or\n",
      "garden-girdled Babylon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon\n",
      "a sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had\n",
      "been a slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable\n",
      "felt in New England for some years; and Wilcox's imagination had been\n",
      "keenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of\n",
      "great Cyclopean cities of Titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all\n",
      "dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror. Hieroglyphics\n",
      "had covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point\n",
      "below had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which\n",
      "only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted to render\n",
      "by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters, \"_Cthulhu fhtagn_\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and\n",
      "disturbed Professor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific\n",
      "minuteness; and studied with almost frantic intensity the bas-relief\n",
      "on which the youth had found himself working, chilled and clad only\n",
      "in his nightclothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him.\n",
      "My uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterward said, for his slowness\n",
      "in recognizing both hieroglyphics and pictorial design. Many of his\n",
      "questions seemed highly out of place to his visitor, especially those\n",
      "which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies;\n",
      "and Wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence\n",
      "which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in\n",
      "some widespread mystical or paganly religious body. When Professor\n",
      "Angell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any\n",
      "cult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his visitor with demands\n",
      "for future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for after the\n",
      "first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man,\n",
      "during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose\n",
      "burden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping\n",
      "stone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously\n",
      "in enigmatical sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two\n",
      "sounds most frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters\n",
      "\"_Cthulhu_\" and \"_R'lyeh_\".\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 23rd, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and\n",
      "inquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an\n",
      "obscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in Waterman\n",
      "Street. He had cried out in the night, arousing several other artists\n",
      "in the building, and had manifested since then only alternations of\n",
      "unconsciousness and delirium. My uncle at once telephoned the family,\n",
      "and from that time forward kept close watch of the case; calling\n",
      "often at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to\n",
      "be in charge. The youth's febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on\n",
      "strange things; and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of\n",
      "them. They included not only a repetition of what he had formerly\n",
      "dreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic thing \"miles high\" which\n",
      "walked or lumbered about. He at no time fully described this object,\n",
      "but occasional frantic words, as repeated by Dr. Tobey, convinced the\n",
      "professor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity\n",
      "he had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this\n",
      "object, the doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man's\n",
      "subsidence into lethargy. His temperature, oddly enough, was not\n",
      "greatly above normal; but the whole condition was otherwise such as to\n",
      "suggest true fever rather than mental disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 2nd at about 3 p. m. every trace of Wilcox's malady suddenly\n",
      "ceased. He sat upright in bed, astonished to find himself at home and\n",
      "completely ignorant of what had happened in dream or reality since the\n",
      "night of March 22nd. Pronounced well by his physician, he returned\n",
      "to his quarters in three days; but to Professor Angell he was of no\n",
      "further assistance. All traces of strange dreaming had vanished with\n",
      "his recovery, and my uncle kept no record of his night-thoughts after a\n",
      "week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain\n",
      "of the scattered notes gave me much material for thought--so much, in\n",
      "fact, that only the ingrained skepticism then forming my philosophy\n",
      "can account for my continued distrust of the artist. The notes in\n",
      "question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons\n",
      "covering the same period as that in which young Wilcox had had his\n",
      "strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a\n",
      "prodigiously far-flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends\n",
      "whom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports\n",
      "of their dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time\n",
      "past. The reception of his request seems to have been varied; but\n",
      "he must, at the very least, have received more responses than any\n",
      "ordinary man could have handled without a secretary. This original\n",
      "correspondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a thorough and\n",
      "really significant digest. Average people in society and business--New\n",
      "England's traditional \"salt of the earth\"--gave an almost completely\n",
      "negative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless\n",
      "nocturnal impressions appear here and there, always between March\n",
      "23rd and April 2nd--the period of young Wilcox's delirium. Scientific\n",
      "men were little more affected, though four cases of vague description\n",
      "suggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case there\n",
      "is mentioned a dread of something abnormal.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came,\n",
      "and I know that panic would have broken loose had they been able to\n",
      "compare notes. As it was, lacking their original letters, I half\n",
      "suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having\n",
      "edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently\n",
      "resolved to see. That is why I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow\n",
      "cognizant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been\n",
      "imposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from esthetes told\n",
      "a disturbing tale. From February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion\n",
      "of them had dreamed very bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams\n",
      "being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor's\n",
      "delirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported\n",
      "scenes and half-sounds not unlike those which Wilcox had described;\n",
      "and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless\n",
      "thing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with\n",
      "emphasis, was very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with\n",
      "leanings toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on\n",
      "the date of young Wilcox's seizure, and expired several months later\n",
      "after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of\n",
      "hell. Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely\n",
      "by number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal\n",
      "investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a\n",
      "few. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have often\n",
      "wondered if all the objects of the professor's questioning felt as\n",
      "puzzled as did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever\n",

      "The press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic,\n",
      "mania, and eccentricity during the given period. Professor Angell\n",

      "tremendous, and the sources scattered throughout the globe. Here\n",
      "was a nocturnal suicide in London, where a lone sleeper had leaped\n",
      "from a window after a shocking cry. Here likewise a rambling letter\n",
      "to the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic deduces\n",
      "a dire future from visions he has seen. A dispatch from California\n",

      "The chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest\n",
      "for the entire meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man\n",
      "who had traveled all the way from New Orleans for certain special\n",
      "information unobtainable from any local source. His name was John\n",
      "Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an inspector of police. With\n",

      "It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the least interest\n",

      "or whatever it was, had been captured some months before in the\n",
      "wooded swamps south of New Orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo\n",
      "meeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with\n",
      "it, that the police could not but realize that they had stumbled on a\n",
      "dark cult totally unknown to them, and infinitely more diabolic than\n",
      "even the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of its origin, apart\n",
      "from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured\n",
      "members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety\n",

      "offering created. One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the\n",
      "assembled men of science into a state of tense excitement, and they\n",
      "lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive figure\n",
      "whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted\n",
      "so potently at unopened and archaic vistas. No recognized school of\n",
      "sculpture had animated this terrible object, yet centuries and even\n",
      "thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of\n",
      "unplaceable stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close\n",
      "and careful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of\n",
      "exquisitely artistic workmanship. It represented a monster of vaguely\n",
      "anthropoid outline, but with an octopuslike head whose face was a mass\n",
      "of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind\n",
      "and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind. This thing, which seemed\n",
      "instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat\n",
      "bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or\n",
      "pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of the wings\n",
      "touched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the center,\n",
      "whilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs\n",
      "gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward\n",
      "the bottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so\n",
      "that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge forepaws\n",
      "which clasped the croucher's elevated knees. The aspect of the whole\n",
      "was abnormally lifelike, and the more subtly fearful because its source\n",
      "was so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and incalculable age was\n",
      "unmistakable; yet not one link did it show with any known type of art\n",
      "belonging to civilization's youth--or indeed to any other time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Totally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the\n",
      "soapy, greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and\n",
      "striations resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy. The\n",
      "characters along the base were equally baffling; and no member present,\n",
      "despite a representation of half the world's expert learning in this\n",
      "field, could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic\n",
      "kinship. They, like the subject and material, belonged to something\n",
      "horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it; something\n",
      "frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which\n",
      "our world and our conceptions have no part.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed\n",

      "who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and\n",
      "writing, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle\n",
      "he knew. This person was the late William Channing Webb, professor of\n",
      "anthropology in Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note.\n",
      "\n",
      "Professor Webb had been engaged, forty-eight years before, in a tour\n",
      "of Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions which\n",
      "he failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast\n",
      "had encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate Eskimos whose\n",
      "religion, a curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its\n",
      "deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which\n",
      "other Eskimos knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders,\n",
      "saying that it had come down from horribly ancient eons before ever the\n",
      "world was made. Besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were\n",
      "certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or\n",
      "_tornasuk_; and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic\n",
      "copy from an aged _angekok_ or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in\n",
      "Roman letters as best he knew how. But just now of prime significance\n",
      "was the fetish which this cult had cherished, and around which they\n",
      "danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs. It was, the\n",
      "professor stated, a very crude bas-relief of stone, comprising a\n",
      "hideous picture and some cryptic writing. And as far as he could tell,\n",
      "it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing\n",
      "now lying before the meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "These data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled\n",
      "members, proved doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at\n",
      "once to ply his informant with questions. Having noted and copied an\n",
      "oral ritual among the swamp cult-worshipers his men had arrested, he\n",
      "besought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken\n",
      "down amongst the diabolist Eskimos. There then followed an exhaustive\n",
      "comparison of details, and a moment of really awed silence when both\n",
      "detective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the phrase\n",
      "common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart. What,\n",

      "by Black-winged Ones which had come to them from their immemorial\n",
      "meeting-place in the haunted wood. But of those mysterious allies no\n",
      "coherent account could ever be gained. What the police did extract\n",
      "came mainly from an immensely aged mestizo named Castro, who claimed\n",
      "to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the\n",
      "cult in the mountains of China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the\n",
      "speculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent\n",
      "and transient indeed. There had been eons when other Things ruled on\n",
      "the earth, and They had had great cities. Remains of Them, he said the\n",
      "deathless Chinamen had told him, were still to be found as Cyclopean\n",

      "before man came, but there were arts which could revive Them when the\n",
      "stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of\n",
      "eternity. They had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought\n",
      "Their images with Them.\n",
      "\n",
      "These Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether\n",
      "of flesh and blood. They had shape--for did not this star-fashioned\n",
      "image prove it?--but that shape was not made of matter. When the stars\n",
      "were right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky;\n",
      "but when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They\n",
      "no longer lived, They would never really die. They all lay in stone\n",
      "houses in Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty\n",
      "Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might\n",
      "once more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside\n",
      "must serve to liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved Them\n",
      "intact likewise prevented Them from making an initial move, and They\n",
      "could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions\n",
      "of years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the universe,\n",
      "for Their mode of speech was transmitted thought. Even now They talked\n",
      "in Their tombs. When, after infinities of chaos, the first men came,\n",
      "the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by molding their\n",
      "dreams; for only thus could Their language reach the fleshly minds of\n",
      "mammals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, whispered Castro, those first men formed the cult around small\n",
      "idols which the Great Ones showed them; idols brought in dim eras\n",
      "from dark stars. That cult would never die till the stars came right\n",
      "again, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb\n",
      "to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would\n",
      "be easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the Great Old\n",
      "Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals\n",
      "thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and reveling in joy. Then\n",
      "the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill\n",
      "and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a\n",
      "holocaust of ecstasy and freedom. Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate\n",
      "rites, must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow\n",
      "forth the prophecy of their return.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old Ones in\n",
      "dreams, but then something had happened. The great stone city R'lyeh,\n",
      "with its monoliths and sepulchers, had sunk beneath the waves; and the\n",
      "deep waters, full of the one primal mystery through which not even\n",
      "thought can pass, had cut off the spectral intercourse. But memory\n",
      "never died, and high priests said that the city would rise again when\n",
      "the stars were right. Then came out of the earth the black spirits of\n",
      "earth, moldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumors picked up in caverns\n",
      "beneath forgotten sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not speak\n",
      "much. He cut himself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or\n",
      "subtlety could elicit more in this direction. The _size_ of the Old\n",
      "Ones, too, he curiously declined to mention. Of the cult, he said that\n",
      "he thought the center lay amid the pathless deserts of Arabia, where\n",
      "Irem, the City of Pillars, dreams hidden and untouched. It was not\n",
      "allied to the European witch-cult, and was virtually unknown beyond its\n",
      "members. No book had ever really hinted of it, though the deathless\n",
      "Chinamen said that there were double meanings in the _Necronomicon_\n",

      "in vain concerning the historic affiliations of the cult. Castro,\n",
      "apparently, had told the truth when he said that it was wholly\n",
      "secret. The authorities at Tulane University could shed no light upon\n",

      "of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncle's expense.\n",

      "sheer impressiveness, it had found subconscious expression in dreams,\n",
      "in the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I now beheld; so that his\n",

      "jambs around it, though they could not decide whether it lay flat like\n",

      "President Winthrop's administration. The country was apparently tranquil.\n",
      "Everybody knows how the Tariff and Labour questions were settled. The war\n",
      "with Germany, incident on that country's seizure of the Samoan Islands,\n",
      "had left no visible scars upon the republic, and the temporary occupation\n",
      "of Norfolk by the invading army had been forgotten in the joy over\n",
      "repeated naval victories, and the subsequent ridiculous plight of General\n",
      "Von Gartenlaube's forces in the State of New Jersey. The Cuban and\n",
      "Hawaiian investments had paid one hundred per cent and the territory of\n",
      "Samoa was well worth its cost as a coaling station. The country was in a\n",
      "superb state of defence. Every coast city had been well supplied with land\n",
      "fortifications; the army under the parental eye of the General Staff,\n",
      "organized according to the Prussian system, had been increased to 300,000\n",
      "men, with a territorial reserve of a million; and six magnificent\n",
      "squadrons of cruisers and battle-ships patrolled the six stations of the\n",
      "navigable seas, leaving a steam reserve amply fitted to control home\n",
      "waters. The gentlemen from the West had at last been constrained to\n",
      "acknowledge that a college for the training of diplomats was as necessary\n",
      "as law schools are for the training of barristers; consequently we were no\n",
      "longer represented abroad by incompetent patriots. The nation was\n",
      "prosperous; Chicago, for a moment paralyzed after a second great fire, had\n",
      "risen from its ruins, white and imperial, and more beautiful than the white\n",
      "city which had been built for its plaything in 1893. Everywhere good\n",
      "architecture was replacing bad, and even in New York, a sudden craving for\n",
      "decency had swept away a great portion of the existing horrors. Streets\n",
      "had been widened, properly paved and lighted, trees had been planted,\n",
      "squares laid out, elevated structures demolished and underground roads\n",
      "built to replace them. The new government buildings and barracks were fine\n",
      "bits of architecture, and the long system of stone quays which completely\n",
      "surrounded the island had been turned into parks which proved a god-send\n",
      "to the population. The subsidizing of the state theatre and state opera\n",
      "brought its own reward. The United States National Academy of Design was\n",
      "much like European institutions of the same kind. Nobody envied the\n",
      "Secretary of Fine Arts, either his cabinet position or his portfolio. The\n",
      "Secretary of Forestry and Game Preservation had a much easier time, thanks\n",
      "to the new system of National Mounted Police. We had profited well by the\n",
      "latest treaties with France and England; the exclusion of foreign-born\n",
      "Jews as a measure of self-preservation, the settlement of the new\n",
      "independent negro state of Suanee, the checking of immigration, the new\n",
      "laws concerning naturalization, and the gradual centralization of power in\n",
      "the executive all contributed to national calm and prosperity. When the\n",
      "Government solved the Indian problem and squadrons of Indian cavalry\n",
      "scouts in native costume were substituted for the pitiable organizations\n",
      "tacked on to the tail of skeletonized regiments by a former Secretary of\n",
      "War, the nation drew a long sigh of relief. When, after the colossal\n",
      "Congress of Religions, bigotry and intolerance were laid in their graves\n",
      "and kindness and charity began to draw warring sects together, many\n",
      "thought the millennium had arrived, at least in the new world which after\n",
      "all is a world by itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But self-preservation is the first law, and the United States had to look\n",
      "on in helpless sorrow as Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium writhed in the\n",

      "the memories of New York people for many a cycle; the Dodge Statue was\n",
      "removed in that year. In the following winter began that agitation for\n",
      "the repeal of the laws prohibiting suicide which bore its final fruit in\n",
      "the month of April, 1920, when the first Government Lethal Chamber was\n",
      "opened on Washington Square.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had walked down that day from Dr. Archer's house on Madison Avenue,\n",
      "where I had been as a mere formality. Ever since that fall from my horse,\n",
      "four years before, I had been troubled at times with pains in the back of\n",
      "my head and neck, but now for months they had been absent, and the doctor\n",
      "sent me away that day saying there was nothing more to be cured in me. It\n",
      "was hardly worth his fee to be told that; I knew it myself. Still I did\n",
      "not grudge him the money. What I minded was the mistake which he made at\n",
      "first. When they picked me up from the pavement where I lay unconscious,\n",
      "and somebody had mercifully sent a bullet through my horse's head, I was\n",
      "carried to Dr. Archer, and he, pronouncing my brain affected, placed me\n",
      "in his private asylum where I was obliged to endure treatment for\n",
      "insanity. At last he decided that I was well, and I, knowing that my mind\n",
      "had always been as sound as his, if not sounder, \"paid my tuition\" as he\n",
      "jokingly called it, and left. I told him, smiling, that I would get even\n",
      "with him for his mistake, and he laughed heartily, and asked me to call\n",
      "once in a while. I did so, hoping for a chance to even up accounts, but\n",
      "he gave me none, and I told him I would wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fall from my horse had fortunately left no evil results; on the\n",
      "contrary it had changed my whole character for the better. From a lazy\n",
      "young man about town, I had become active, energetic, temperate, and\n",
      "above all--oh, above all else--ambitious. There was only one thing which\n",
      "troubled me, I laughed at my own uneasiness, and yet it troubled me.\n",
      "\n",
      "During my convalescence I had bought and read for the first time, _The\n",
      "King in Yellow_. I remember after finishing the first act that it\n",
      "occurred to me that I had better stop. I started up and flung the book\n",
      "into the fireplace; the volume struck the barred grate and fell open on\n",
      "the hearth in the firelight. If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening\n",
      "words in the second act I should never have finished it, but as I stooped\n",
      "to pick it up, my eyes became riveted to the open page, and with a cry of\n",
      "terror, or perhaps it was of joy so poignant that I suffered in every\n",
      "nerve, I snatched the thing out of the coals and crept shaking to my\n",
      "bedroom, where I read it and reread it, and wept and laughed and trembled\n",
      "with a horror which at times assails me yet. This is the thing that\n",
      "troubles me, for I cannot forget Carcosa where black stars hang in the\n",
      "heavens; where the shadows of men's thoughts lengthen in the afternoon,\n",
      "when the twin suns sink into the lake of Hali; and my mind will bear for\n",
      "ever the memory of the Pallid Mask. I pray God will curse the writer, as\n",
      "the writer has cursed the world with this beautiful, stupendous creation,\n",
      "terrible in its simplicity, irresistible in its truth--a world which now\n",
      "trembles before the King in Yellow. When the French Government seized the\n",
      "translated copies which had just arrived in Paris, London, of course,\n",
      "became eager to read it. It is well known how the book spread like an\n",
      "infectious disease, from city to city, from continent to continent,\n",
      "barred out here, confiscated there, denounced by Press and pulpit,\n",
      "censured even by the most advanced of literary anarchists. No definite\n",
      "principles had been violated in those wicked pages, no doctrine\n",
      "promulgated, no convictions outraged. It could not be judged by any known\n",
      "standard, yet, although it was acknowledged that the supreme note of art\n",
      "had been struck in _The King in Yellow_, all felt that human nature\n",
      "could not bear the strain, nor thrive on words in which the essence of\n",
      "purest poison lurked. The very banality and innocence of the first act\n",
      "only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, I remember, the 13th day of April, 1920, that the first\n",
      "Government Lethal Chamber was established on the south side of Washington\n",
      "Square, between Wooster Street and South Fifth Avenue. The block which\n",
      "had formerly consisted of a lot of shabby old buildings, used as cafés\n",
      "and restaurants for foreigners, had been acquired by the Government in\n",
      "the winter of 1898. The French and Italian cafés and restaurants were\n",
      "torn down; the whole block was enclosed by a gilded iron railing, and\n",
      "converted into a lovely garden with lawns, flowers and fountains. In the\n",
      "centre of the garden stood a small, white building, severely classical in\n",
      "architecture, and surrounded by thickets of flowers. Six Ionic columns\n",
      "supported the roof, and the single door was of bronze. A splendid marble\n",
      "group of the \"Fates\" stood before the door, the work of a young American\n",
      "sculptor, Boris Yvain, who had died in Paris when only twenty-three years\n",
      "old.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inauguration ceremonies were in progress as I crossed University\n",
      "Place and entered the square. I threaded my way through the silent throng\n",
      "of spectators, but was stopped at Fourth Street by a cordon of police. A\n",
      "regiment of United States lancers were drawn up in a hollow square round\n",
      "the Lethal Chamber. On a raised tribune facing Washington Park stood the\n",
      "Governor of New York, and behind him were grouped the Mayor of New\n",
      "York and Brooklyn, the Inspector-General of Police, the Commandant of\n",
      "the state troops, Colonel Livingston, military aid to the President of the\n",
      "United States, General Blount, commanding at Governor's Island,\n",
      "Major-General Hamilton, commanding the garrison of New York and Brooklyn,\n",
      "Admiral Buffby of the fleet in the North River, Surgeon-General\n",
      "Lanceford, the staff of the National Free Hospital, Senators Wyse and\n",
      "Franklin of New York, and the Commissioner of Public Works. The tribune\n",
      "was surrounded by a squadron of hussars of the National Guard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Governor was finishing his reply to the short speech of the\n",
      "Surgeon-General. I heard him say: \"The laws prohibiting suicide and\n",
      "providing punishment for any attempt at self-destruction have been\n",
      "repealed. The Government has seen fit to acknowledge the right of man to\n",
      "end an existence which may have become intolerable to him, through\n",
      "physical suffering or mental despair. It is believed that the community\n",
      "will be benefited by the removal of such people from their midst. Since\n",
      "the passage of this law, the number of suicides in the United States has\n",
      "not increased. Now the Government has determined to establish a Lethal\n",
      "Chamber in every city, town and village in the country, it remains to be\n",
      "seen whether or not that class of human creatures from whose desponding\n",
      "ranks new victims of self-destruction fall daily will accept the relief\n",
      "thus provided.\" He paused, and turned to the white Lethal Chamber. The\n",
      "silence in the street was absolute. \"There a painless death awaits him\n",
      "who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life. If death is welcome let\n",
      "him seek it there.\" Then quickly turning to the military aid of the\n",
      "President's household, he said, \"I declare the Lethal Chamber open,\" and\n",
      "again facing the vast crowd he cried in a clear voice: \"Citizens of New\n",
      "York and of the United States of America, through me the Government\n",
      "declares the Lethal Chamber to be open.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The solemn hush was broken by a sharp cry of command, the squadron of\n",
      "hussars filed after the Governor's carriage, the lancers wheeled and\n",
      "formed along Fifth Avenue to wait for the commandant of the garrison, and\n",
      "the mounted police followed them. I left the crowd to gape and stare at\n",
      "the white marble Death Chamber, and, crossing South Fifth Avenue, walked\n",
      "along the western side of that thoroughfare to Bleecker Street. Then I\n",
      "turned to the right and stopped before a dingy shop which bore the sign:\n",
      "\n",
      "HAWBERK, ARMOURER.\n",
      "\n",
      "I glanced in at the doorway and saw Hawberk busy in his little shop at\n",
      "the end of the hall. He looked up, and catching sight of me cried in his\n",
      "deep, hearty voice, \"Come in, Mr. Castaigne!\" Constance, his daughter,\n",
      "rose to meet me as I crossed the threshold, and held out her pretty\n",
      "hand, but I saw the blush of disappointment on her cheeks, and knew\n",
      "that it was another Castaigne she had expected, my cousin Louis. I\n",
      "smiled at her confusion and complimented her on the banner she was\n",
      "embroidering from a coloured plate. Old Hawberk sat riveting the worn\n",
      "greaves of some ancient suit of armour, and the ting! ting! ting! of his\n",
      "little hammer sounded pleasantly in the quaint shop. Presently he\n",
      "dropped his hammer, and fussed about for a moment with a tiny wrench.\n",
      "The soft clash of the mail sent a thrill of pleasure through me. I\n",
      "loved to hear the music of steel brushing against steel, the mellow\n",
      "shock of the mallet on thigh pieces, and the jingle of chain armour.\n",
      "That was the only reason I went to see Hawberk. He had never interested\n",
      "me personally, nor did Constance, except for the fact of her being in\n",
      "love with Louis. This did occupy my attention, and sometimes even kept\n",
      "me awake at night. But I knew in my heart that all would come right,\n",
      "and that I should arrange their future as I expected to arrange that of\n",
      "my kind doctor, John Archer. However, I should never have troubled\n",
      "myself about visiting them just then, had it not been, as I say, that\n",
      "the music of the tinkling hammer had for me this strong fascination. I\n",
      "would sit for hours, listening and listening, and when a stray sunbeam\n",
      "struck the inlaid steel, the sensation it gave me was almost too keen\n",
      "to endure. My eyes would become fixed, dilating with a pleasure that\n",
      "stretched every nerve almost to breaking, until some movement of the\n",
      "old armourer cut off the ray of sunlight, then, still thrilling\n",
      "secretly, I leaned back and listened again to the sound of the\n",
      "polishing rag, swish! swish! rubbing rust from the rivets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Constance worked with the embroidery over her knees, now and then pausing\n",
      "to examine more closely the pattern in the coloured plate from the\n",
      "Metropolitan Museum.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is this for?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hawberk explained, that in addition to the treasures of armour in the\n",
      "Metropolitan Museum of which he had been appointed armourer, he also\n",
      "had charge of several collections belonging to rich amateurs. This was the\n",
      "missing greave of a famous suit which a client of his had traced to a\n",
      "little shop in Paris on the Quai d'Orsay. He, Hawberk, had negotiated for\n",
      "and secured the greave, and now the suit was complete. He laid down his\n",
      "hammer and read me the history of the suit, traced since 1450 from owner\n",
      "to owner until it was acquired by Thomas Stainbridge. When his superb\n",
      "collection was sold, this client of Hawberk's bought the suit, and since\n",
      "then the search for the missing greave had been pushed until it was,\n",
      "almost by accident, located in Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you continue the search so persistently without any certainty of the\n",
      "greave being still in existence?\" I demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" he replied coolly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then for the first time I took a personal interest in Hawberk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was worth something to you,\" I ventured.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" he replied, laughing, \"my pleasure in finding it was my reward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you no ambition to be rich?\" I asked, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My one ambition is to be the best armourer in the world,\" he answered\n",
      "gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Constance asked me if I had seen the ceremonies at the Lethal Chamber.\n",
      "She herself had noticed cavalry passing up Broadway that morning, and had\n",
      "wished to see the inauguration, but her father wanted the banner\n",
      "finished, and she had stayed at his request.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you see your cousin, Mr. Castaigne, there?\" she asked, with the\n",
      "slightest tremor of her soft eyelashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" I replied carelessly. \"Louis' regiment is manoeuvring out in\n",
      "Westchester County.\" I rose and picked up my hat and cane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you going upstairs to see the lunatic again?\" laughed old Hawberk.\n",
      "If Hawberk knew how I loathe that word \"lunatic,\" he would never use it\n",
      "in my presence. It rouses certain feelings within me which I do not care\n",
      "to explain. However, I answered him quietly: \"I think I shall drop in and\n",
      "see Mr. Wilde for a moment or two.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor fellow,\" said Constance, with a shake of the head, \"it must be hard\n",
      "to live alone year after year poor, crippled and almost demented. It is\n",
      "very good of you, Mr. Castaigne, to visit him as often as you do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think he is vicious,\" observed Hawberk, beginning again with his\n",
      "hammer. I listened to the golden tinkle on the greave plates; when he had\n",
      "finished I replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, he is not vicious, nor is he in the least demented. His mind is a\n",
      "wonder chamber, from which he can extract treasures that you and I would\n",
      "give years of our life to acquire.\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "Hawberk laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I continued a little impatiently: \"He knows history as no one else could\n",
      "know it. Nothing, however trivial, escapes his search, and his memory is\n",
      "so absolute, so precise in details, that were it known in New York that\n",
      "such a man existed, the people could not honour him enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense,\" muttered Hawberk, searching on the floor for a fallen rivet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it nonsense,\" I asked, managing to suppress what I felt, \"is it\n",
      "nonsense when he says that the tassets and cuissards of the enamelled\n",
      "suit of armour commonly known as the 'Prince's Emblazoned' can be found\n",
      "among a mass of rusty theatrical properties, broken stoves and\n",
      "ragpicker's refuse in a garret in Pell Street?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hawberk's hammer fell to the ground, but he picked it up and asked, with\n",
      "a great deal of calm, how I knew that the tassets and left cuissard were\n",
      "missing from the \"Prince's Emblazoned.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not know until Mr. Wilde mentioned it to me the other day. He said\n",
      "they were in the garret of 998 Pell Street.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense,\" he cried, but I noticed his hand trembling under his leathern\n",
      "apron.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this nonsense too?\" I asked pleasantly, \"is it nonsense when Mr.\n",
      "Wilde continually speaks of you as the Marquis of Avonshire and of Miss\n",
      "Constance--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not finish, for Constance had started to her feet with terror\n",
      "written on every feature. Hawberk looked at me and slowly smoothed his\n",
      "leathern apron.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is impossible,\" he observed, \"Mr. Wilde may know a great many\n",
      "things--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About armour, for instance, and the 'Prince's Emblazoned,'\" I\n",
      "interposed, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he continued, slowly, \"about armour also--may be--but he is wrong\n",
      "in regard to the Marquis of Avonshire, who, as you know, killed his\n",
      "wife's traducer years ago, and went to Australia where he did not long\n",
      "survive his wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Wilde is wrong,\" murmured Constance. Her lips were blanched, but her\n",
      "voice was sweet and calm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us agree, if you please, that in this one circumstance Mr. Wilde is\n",
      "wrong,\" I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",
      "\n",
      "I climbed the three dilapidated flights of stairs, which I had so often\n",
      "climbed before, and knocked at a small door at the end of the corridor.\n",
      "Mr. Wilde opened the door and I walked in.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had double-locked the door and pushed a heavy chest against it,\n",
      "he came and sat down beside me, peering up into my face with his little\n",
      "light-coloured eyes. Half a dozen new scratches covered his nose and\n",
      "cheeks, and the silver wires which supported his artificial ears had\n",
      "become displaced. I thought I had never seen him so hideously\n",
      "fascinating. He had no ears. The artificial ones, which now stood out at\n",
      "an angle from the fine wire, were his one weakness. They were made of wax\n",
      "and painted a shell pink, but the rest of his face was yellow. He might\n",
      "better have revelled in the luxury of some artificial fingers for his\n",
      "left hand, which was absolutely fingerless, but it seemed to cause him no\n",
      "inconvenience, and he was satisfied with his wax ears. He was very small,\n",
      "scarcely higher than a child of ten, but his arms were magnificently\n",
      "developed, and his thighs as thick as any athlete's. Still, the most\n",
      "remarkable thing about Mr. Wilde was that a man of his marvellous\n",
      "intelligence and knowledge should have such a head. It was flat and\n",
      "pointed, like the heads of many of those unfortunates whom people\n",
      "imprison in asylums for the weak-minded. Many called him insane, but I\n",
      "knew him to be as sane as I was.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not deny that he was eccentric; the mania he had for keeping that\n",
      "cat and teasing her until she flew at his face like a demon, was\n",
      "certainly eccentric. I never could understand why he kept the creature,\n",
      "nor what pleasure he found in shutting himself up in his room with this\n",
      "surly, vicious beast. I remember once, glancing up from the manuscript I\n",
      "was studying by the light of some tallow dips, and seeing Mr. Wilde\n",
      "squatting motionless on his high chair, his eyes fairly blazing with\n",
      "excitement, while the cat, which had risen from her place before the\n",
      "stove, came creeping across the floor right at him. Before I could move\n",
      "she flattened her belly to the ground, crouched, trembled, and sprang\n",
      "into his face. Howling and foaming they rolled over and over on the\n",
      "floor, scratching and clawing, until the cat screamed and fled under the\n",
      "cabinet, and Mr. Wilde turned over on his back, his limbs contracting and\n",
      "curling up like the legs of a dying spider. He _was_ eccentric.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wilde had climbed into his high chair, and, after studying my face,\n",
      "picked up a dog's-eared ledger and opened it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Henry B. Matthews,\" he read, \"book-keeper with Whysot Whysot and\n",

      "me more than I would gain by it. To-day I have five hundred men in my\n",
      "employ, who are poorly paid, but who pursue the work with an enthusiasm\n",
      "which possibly may be born of fear. These men enter every shade and grade\n",
      "of society; some even are pillars of the most exclusive social temples;\n",
      "others are the prop and pride of the financial world; still others, hold\n",
      "undisputed sway among the 'Fancy and the Talent.' I choose them at my\n",
      "leisure from those who reply to my advertisements. It is easy enough,\n",
      "they are all cowards. I could treble the number in twenty days if I\n",
      "wished. So you see, those who have in their keeping the reputations of\n",
      "their fellow-citizens, I have in my pay.\"\n",

      "The cat, which had entered the room as he spoke, hesitated, looked up at\n",
      "him and snarled. He climbed down from the chair and squatting on the\n",
      "floor, took the creature into his arms and caressed her. The cat ceased\n",
      "snarling and presently began a loud purring which seemed to increase in\n",
      "timbre as he stroked her. \"Where are the notes?\" I asked. He pointed to\n",
      "the table, and for the hundredth time I picked up the bundle of\n",
      "manuscript entitled--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"THE IMPERIAL DYNASTY OF AMERICA.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One by one I studied the well-worn pages, worn only by my own handling,\n",

      "\"And Dr. Archer! But that's a matter you can settle any time you wish,\"\n",

      "the first twenty-eight hours, and in forty-eight hours the state will\n",
      "rise _en masse_. The country follows the state, and the portion that\n",

      "\"You are speaking of the King in Yellow,\" I groaned, with a shudder.\n",

      "\n",
      "I started to reply, but a sudden burst of military music from the street\n",
      "below drowned my voice. The twentieth dragoon regiment, formerly in\n",
      "garrison at Mount St. Vincent, was returning from the manoeuvres in\n",
      "Westchester County, to its new barracks on East Washington Square. It was\n",
      "my cousin's regiment. They were a fine lot of fellows, in their pale\n",
      "blue, tight-fitting jackets, jaunty busbys and white riding breeches with\n",
      "the double yellow stripe, into which their limbs seemed moulded. Every\n",
      "other squadron was armed with lances, from the metal points of which\n",
      "fluttered yellow and white pennons. The band passed, playing the\n",
      "regimental march, then came the colonel and staff, the horses crowding\n",
      "and trampling, while their heads bobbed in unison, and the pennons\n",
      "fluttered from their lance points. The troopers, who rode with the\n",
      "beautiful English seat, looked brown as berries from their bloodless\n",
      "campaign among the farms of Westchester, and the music of their sabres\n",
      "against the stirrups, and the jingle of spurs and carbines was delightful\n",
      "to me. I saw Louis riding with his squadron. He was as handsome an\n",
      "officer as I have ever seen. Mr. Wilde, who had mounted a chair by the\n",
      "window, saw him too, but said nothing. Louis turned and looked straight\n",
      "at Hawberk's shop as he passed, and I could see the flush on his brown\n",
      "cheeks. I think Constance must have been at the window. When the last\n",
      "troopers had clattered by, and the last pennons vanished into South Fifth\n",
      "Avenue, Mr. Wilde clambered out of his chair and dragged the chest away\n",
      "from the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he said, \"it is time that you saw your cousin Louis.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He unlocked the door and I picked up my hat and stick and stepped into\n",
      "the corridor. The stairs were dark. Groping about, I set my foot on\n",
      "something soft, which snarled and spit, and I aimed a murderous blow at\n",
      "the cat, but my cane shivered to splinters against the balustrade, and\n",
      "the beast scurried back into Mr. Wilde's room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passing Hawberk's door again I saw him still at work on the armour, but\n",
      "I did not stop, and stepping out into Bleecker Street, I followed it to\n",
      "Wooster, skirted the grounds of the Lethal Chamber, and crossing\n",
      "Washington Park went straight to my rooms in the Benedick. Here I lunched\n",
      "comfortably, read the _Herald_ and the _Meteor_, and finally went\n",
      "to the steel safe in my bedroom and set the time combination. The\n",
      "three and three-quarter minutes which it is necessary to wait, while the\n",
      "time lock is opening, are to me golden moments. From the instant I set\n",
      "the combination to the moment when I grasp the knobs and swing back\n",
      "the solid steel doors, I live in an ecstasy of expectation. Those moments\n",
      "must be like moments passed in Paradise. I know what I am to find at\n",
      "the end of the time limit. I know what the massive safe holds secure for\n",
      "me, for me alone, and the exquisite pleasure of waiting is hardly enhanced\n",
      "when the safe opens and I lift, from its velvet crown, a diadem of purest\n",
      "gold, blazing with diamonds. I do this every day, and yet the joy of\n",
      "waiting and at last touching again the diadem, only seems to increase as\n",
      "the days pass. It is a diadem fit for a King among kings, an Emperor\n",
      "among emperors. The King in Yellow might scorn it, but it shall be worn\n",
      "by his royal servant.\n",
      "\n",
      "I held it in my arms until the alarm in the safe rang harshly, and then\n",
      "tenderly, proudly, I replaced it and shut the steel doors. I walked\n",
      "slowly back into my study, which faces Washington Square, and leaned on\n",
      "the window sill. The afternoon sun poured into my windows, and a gentle\n",
      "breeze stirred the branches of the elms and maples in the park, now\n",
      "covered with buds and tender foliage. A flock of pigeons circled about\n",
      "the tower of the Memorial Church; sometimes alighting on the purple tiled\n",
      "roof, sometimes wheeling downward to the lotos fountain in front of the\n",

      "reckless disregard for the pasty-faced occupants, which could probably be\n",

      "I looked at the Lethal Chamber on the corner of the square opposite. A\n",
      "few curious people still lingered about the gilded iron railing, but\n",
      "inside the grounds the paths were deserted. I watched the fountains\n",
      "ripple and sparkle; the sparrows had already found this new bathing nook,\n",
      "and the basins were covered with the dusty-feathered little things. Two\n",
      "or three white peacocks picked their way across the lawns, and a drab\n",
      "coloured pigeon sat so motionless on the arm of one of the \"Fates,\" that\n",
      "it seemed to be a part of the sculptured stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was turning carelessly away, a slight commotion in the group of\n",
      "curious loiterers around the gates attracted my attention. A young man\n",
      "had entered, and was advancing with nervous strides along the gravel path\n",
      "which leads to the bronze doors of the Lethal Chamber. He paused a moment\n",
      "before the \"Fates,\" and as he raised his head to those three mysterious\n",
      "faces, the pigeon rose from its sculptured perch, circled about for a\n",
      "moment and wheeled to the east. The young man pressed his hand to his\n",
      "face, and then with an undefinable gesture sprang up the marble steps,\n",
      "the bronze doors closed behind him, and half an hour later the loiterers\n",
      "slouched away, and the frightened pigeon returned to its perch in the\n",
      "arms of Fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I put on my hat and went out into the park for a little walk before\n",
      "dinner. As I crossed the central driveway a group of officers passed, and\n",
      "one of them called out, \"Hello, Hildred,\" and came back to shake hands\n",
      "with me. It was my cousin Louis, who stood smiling and tapping his\n",
      "spurred heels with his riding-whip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just back from Westchester,\" he said; \"been doing the bucolic; milk and\n",
      "curds, you know, dairy-maids in sunbonnets, who say 'haeow' and 'I don't\n",
      "think' when you tell them they are pretty. I'm nearly dead for a square\n",
      "meal at Delmonico's. What's the news?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is none,\" I replied pleasantly. \"I saw your regiment coming in this\n",
      "morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you? I didn't see you. Where were you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In Mr. Wilde's window.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, hell!\" he began impatiently, \"that man is stark mad! I don't\n",
      "understand why you--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw how annoyed I felt by this outburst, and begged my pardon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really, old chap,\" he said, \"I don't mean to run down a man you like,\n",
      "but for the life of me I can't see what the deuce you find in common with\n",
      "Mr. Wilde. He's not well bred, to put it generously; he is hideously\n",
      "deformed; his head is the head of a criminally insane person. You know\n",
      "yourself he's been in an asylum--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So have I,\" I interrupted calmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Louis looked startled and confused for a moment, but recovered and\n",
      "slapped me heartily on the shoulder. \"You were completely cured,\" he\n",
      "began; but I stopped him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose you mean that I was simply acknowledged never to have been\n",
      "insane.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course that--that's what I meant,\" he laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I disliked his laugh because I knew it was forced, but I nodded gaily and\n",
      "asked him where he was going. Louis looked after his brother officers who\n",
      "had now almost reached Broadway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had intended to sample a Brunswick cocktail, but to tell you the\n",
      "truth I was anxious for an excuse to go and see Hawberk instead. Come\n",
      "along, I'll make you my excuse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We found old Hawberk, neatly attired in a fresh spring suit, standing at\n",
      "the door of his shop and sniffing the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had just decided to take Constance for a little stroll before dinner,\"\n",
      "he replied to the impetuous volley of questions from Louis. \"We thought\n",
      "of walking on the park terrace along the North River.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment Constance appeared and grew pale and rosy by turns as\n",
      "Louis bent over her small gloved fingers. I tried to excuse myself,\n",
      "alleging an engagement uptown, but Louis and Constance would not listen,\n",
      "and I saw I was expected to remain and engage old Hawberk's attention.\n",
      "After all it would be just as well if I kept my eye on Louis, I thought,\n",
      "and when they hailed a Spring Street horse-car, I got in after them and\n",
      "took my seat beside the armourer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beautiful line of parks and granite terraces overlooking the wharves\n",
      "along the North River, which were built in 1910 and finished in the\n",
      "autumn of 1917, had become one of the most popular promenades in the\n",
      "metropolis. They extended from the battery to 190th Street, overlooking\n",
      "the noble river and affording a fine view of the Jersey shore and the\n",
      "Highlands opposite. Cafés and restaurants were scattered here and there\n",
      "among the trees, and twice a week military bands from the garrison played\n",
      "in the kiosques on the parapets.\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat down in the sunshine on the bench at the foot of the equestrian\n",
      "statue of General Sheridan. Constance tipped her sunshade to shield her\n",
      "eyes, and she and Louis began a murmuring conversation which was\n",
      "impossible to catch. Old Hawberk, leaning on his ivory headed cane,\n",
      "lighted an excellent cigar, the mate to which I politely refused, and\n",
      "smiled at vacancy. The sun hung low above the Staten Island woods, and\n",
      "the bay was dyed with golden hues reflected from the sun-warmed sails of\n",
      "the shipping in the harbour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brigs, schooners, yachts, clumsy ferry-boats, their decks swarming with\n",
      "people, railroad transports carrying lines of brown, blue and white\n",
      "freight cars, stately sound steamers, déclassé tramp steamers, coasters,\n",
      "dredgers, scows, and everywhere pervading the entire bay impudent little\n",
      "tugs puffing and whistling officiously;--these were the craft which\n",
      "churned the sunlight waters as far as the eye could reach. In calm\n",
      "contrast to the hurry of sailing vessel and steamer a silent fleet of\n",
      "white warships lay motionless in midstream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Constance's merry laugh aroused me from my reverie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What _are_ you staring at?\" she inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing--the fleet,\" I smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Louis told us what the vessels were, pointing out each by its\n",
      "relative position to the old Red Fort on Governor's Island.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That little cigar shaped thing is a torpedo boat,\" he explained; \"there\n",
      "are four more lying close together. They are the _Tarpon_, the _Falcon_,\n",
      "the _Sea Fox_, and the _Octopus_. The gun-boats just above are the\n",
      "_Princeton_, the _Champlain_, the _Still Water_ and the _Erie_. Next to\n",
      "them lie the cruisers _Faragut_ and _Los Angeles_, and above them the\n",
      "battle ships _California_, and _Dakota_, and the _Washington_ which is\n",
      "the flag ship. Those two squatty looking chunks of metal which are\n",
      "anchored there off Castle William are the double turreted monitors\n",
      "_Terrible_ and _Magnificent_; behind them lies the ram, _Osceola_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Constance looked at him with deep approval in her beautiful eyes. \"What\n",
      "loads of things you know for a soldier,\" she said, and we all joined in\n",
      "the laugh which followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently Louis rose with a nod to us and offered his arm to Constance,\n",
      "and they strolled away along the river wall. Hawberk watched them for a\n",
      "moment and then turned to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Wilde was right,\" he said. \"I have found the missing tassets and\n",
      "left cuissard of the 'Prince's Emblazoned,' in a vile old junk garret in\n",
      "Pell Street.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"998?\" I inquired, with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Wilde is a very intelligent man,\" I observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to give him the credit of this most important discovery,\"\n",
      "continued Hawberk. \"And I intend it shall be known that he is entitled\n",
      "to the fame of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He won't thank you for that,\" I answered sharply; \"please say nothing\n",
      "about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know what it is worth?\" said Hawberk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, fifty dollars, perhaps.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is valued at five hundred, but the owner of the 'Prince's Emblazoned'\n",
      "will give two thousand dollars to the person who completes his suit; that\n",
      "reward also belongs to Mr. Wilde.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He doesn't want it! He refuses it!\" I answered angrily. \"What do you\n",
      "know about Mr. Wilde? He doesn't need the money. He is rich--or will\n",
      "be--richer than any living man except myself. What will we care for money\n",
      "then--what will we care, he and I, when--when--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When what?\" demanded Hawberk, astonished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will see,\" I replied, on my guard again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at me narrowly, much as Doctor Archer used to, and I knew he\n",
      "thought I was mentally unsound. Perhaps it was fortunate for him that he\n",
      "did not use the word lunatic just then.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" I replied to his unspoken thought, \"I am not mentally weak; my mind\n",
      "is as healthy as Mr. Wilde's. I do not care to explain just yet what I\n",
      "have on hand, but it is an investment which will pay more than mere gold,\n",
      "silver and precious stones. It will secure the happiness and prosperity\n",
      "of a continent--yes, a hemisphere!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said Hawberk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And eventually,\" I continued more quietly, \"it will secure the happiness\n",
      "of the whole world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And incidentally your own happiness and prosperity as well as Mr.\n",
      "Wilde's?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly,\" I smiled. But I could have throttled him for taking that tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at me in silence for a while and then said very gently, \"Why\n",
      "don't you give up your books and studies, Mr. Castaigne, and take a tramp\n",
      "among the mountains somewhere or other? You used to be fond of fishing.\n",
      "Take a cast or two at the trout in the Rangelys.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't care for fishing any more,\" I answered, without a shade of\n",
      "annoyance in my voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You used to be fond of everything,\" he continued; \"athletics, yachting,\n",
      "shooting, riding--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have never cared to ride since my fall,\" I said quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, yes, your fall,\" he repeated, looking away from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought this nonsense had gone far enough, so I brought the\n",
      "conversation back to Mr. Wilde; but he was scanning my face again in a\n",
      "manner highly offensive to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Wilde,\" he repeated, \"do you know what he did this afternoon? He\n",
      "came downstairs and nailed a sign over the hall door next to mine; it\n",
      "read:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"MR. WILDE,\n",
      "REPAIRER OF REPUTATIONS.\n",
      "Third Bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know what a Repairer of Reputations can be?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do,\" I replied, suppressing the rage within.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" he said again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Louis and Constance came strolling by and stopped to ask if we would join\n",
      "them. Hawberk looked at his watch. At the same moment a puff of smoke\n",
      "shot from the casemates of Castle William, and the boom of the sunset gun\n",
      "rolled across the water and was re-echoed from the Highlands opposite.\n",
      "The flag came running down from the flag-pole, the bugles sounded on the\n",
      "white decks of the warships, and the first electric light sparkled out\n",
      "from the Jersey shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I turned into the city with Hawberk I heard Constance murmur something\n",
      "to Louis which I did not understand; but Louis whispered \"My darling,\" in\n",
      "reply; and again, walking ahead with Hawberk through the square I heard a\n",
      "murmur of \"sweetheart,\" and \"my own Constance,\" and I knew the time had\n",
      "nearly arrived when I should speak of important matters with my cousin\n",
      "Louis.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "One morning early in May I stood before the steel safe in my bedroom,\n",
      "trying on the golden jewelled crown. The diamonds flashed fire as I\n",
      "turned to the mirror, and the heavy beaten gold burned like a halo about\n",
      "my head. I remembered Camilla's agonized scream and the awful words\n",
      "echoing through the dim streets of Carcosa. They were the last lines in\n",
      "the first act, and I dared not think of what followed--dared not, even\n",
      "in the spring sunshine, there in my own room, surrounded with familiar\n",
      "objects, reassured by the bustle from the street and the voices of the\n",
      "servants in the hallway outside. For those poisoned words had dropped\n",
      "slowly into my heart, as death-sweat drops upon a bed-sheet and is\n",
      "absorbed. Trembling, I put the diadem from my head and wiped my forehead,\n",
      "but I thought of Hastur and of my own rightful ambition, and I remembered\n",
      "Mr. Wilde as I had last left him, his face all torn and bloody from the\n",
      "claws of that devil's creature, and what he said--ah, what he said. The\n",
      "alarm bell in the safe began to whirr harshly, and I knew my time was up;\n",
      "but I would not heed it, and replacing the flashing circlet upon my head\n",
      "I turned defiantly to the mirror. I stood for a long time absorbed in the\n",
      "changing expression of my own eyes. The mirror reflected a face which was\n",
      "like my own, but whiter, and so thin that I hardly recognized it And all\n",
      "the time I kept repeating between my clenched teeth, \"The day has come!\n",
      "the day has come!\" while the alarm in the safe whirred and clamoured, and\n",
      "the diamonds sparkled and flamed above my brow. I heard a door open but\n",
      "did not heed it. It was only when I saw two faces in the mirror:--it was\n",
      "only when another face rose over my shoulder, and two other eyes met\n",
      "mine. I wheeled like a flash and seized a long knife from my\n",
      "dressing-table, and my cousin sprang back very pale, crying: \"Hildred!\n",
      "for God's sake!\" then as my hand fell, he said: \"It is I, Louis, don't\n",
      "you know me?\" I stood silent. I could not have spoken for my life. He\n",
      "walked up to me and took the knife from my hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is all this?\" he inquired, in a gentle voice. \"Are you ill?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" I replied. But I doubt if he heard me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, come, old fellow,\" he cried, \"take off that brass crown and toddle\n",
      "into the study. Are you going to a masquerade? What's all this theatrical\n",
      "tinsel anyway?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was glad he thought the crown was made of brass and paste, yet I didn't\n",
      "like him any the better for thinking so. I let him take it from my hand,\n",
      "knowing it was best to humour him. He tossed the splendid diadem in the\n",
      "air, and catching it, turned to me smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's dear at fifty cents,\" he said. \"What's it for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not answer, but took the circlet from his hands, and placing it in\n",
      "the safe shut the massive steel door. The alarm ceased its infernal din\n",
      "at once. He watched me curiously, but did not seem to notice the sudden\n",
      "ceasing of the alarm. He did, however, speak of the safe as a biscuit\n",
      "box. Fearing lest he might examine the combination I led the way into my\n",
      "study. Louis threw himself on the sofa and flicked at flies with his\n",
      "eternal riding-whip. He wore his fatigue uniform with the braided jacket\n",
      "and jaunty cap, and I noticed that his riding-boots were all splashed\n",
      "with red mud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where have you been?\" I inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jumping mud creeks in Jersey,\" he said. \"I haven't had time to change\n",
      "yet; I was rather in a hurry to see you. Haven't you got a glass of\n",
      "something? I'm dead tired; been in the saddle twenty-four hours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave him some brandy from my medicinal store, which he drank with a\n",
      "grimace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Damned bad stuff,\" he observed. \"I'll give you an address where they\n",
      "sell brandy that is brandy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's good enough for my needs,\" I said indifferently. \"I use it to rub\n",
      "my chest with.\" He stared and flicked at another fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See here, old fellow,\" he began, \"I've got something to suggest to you.\n",
      "It's four years now that you've shut yourself up here like an owl, never\n",
      "going anywhere, never taking any healthy exercise, never doing a damn\n",
      "thing but poring over those books up there on the mantelpiece.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He glanced along the row of shelves. \"Napoleon, Napoleon, Napoleon!\" he\n",
      "read. \"For heaven's sake, have you nothing but Napoleons there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish they were bound in gold,\" I said. \"But wait, yes, there is\n",
      "another book, _The King in Yellow_.\" I looked him steadily in the\n",
      "eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you never read it?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I? No, thank God! I don't want to be driven crazy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw he regretted his speech as soon as he had uttered it. There is only\n",
      "one word which I loathe more than I do lunatic and that word is crazy.\n",
      "But I controlled myself and asked him why he thought _The King in\n",
      "Yellow_ dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't know,\" he said, hastily. \"I only remember the excitement it\n",
      "created and the denunciations from pulpit and Press. I believe the author\n",
      "shot himself after bringing forth this monstrosity, didn't he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand he is still alive,\" I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's probably true,\" he muttered; \"bullets couldn't kill a fiend like\n",
      "that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a book of great truths,\" I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he replied, \"of 'truths' which send men frantic and blast their\n",
      "lives. I don't care if the thing is, as they say, the very supreme\n",
      "essence of art. It's a crime to have written it, and I for one shall\n",
      "never open its pages.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that what you have come to tell me?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" he said, \"I came to tell you that I am going to be married.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe for a moment my heart ceased to beat, but I kept my eyes on his\n",
      "face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he continued, smiling happily, \"married to the sweetest girl on\n",

      "\"Constance Hawberk,\" I said mechanically.\n",
      "\n",

      "dinner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When is it to be?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was to have been next September, but an hour ago a despatch came\n",
      "ordering our regiment to the Presidio, San Francisco. We leave at noon\n",
      "to-morrow. To-morrow,\" he repeated. \"Just think, Hildred, to-morrow I\n",
      "shall be the happiest fellow that ever drew breath in this jolly world,\n",
      "for Constance will go with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I offered him my hand in congratulation, and he seized and shook it like\n",
      "the good-natured fool he was--or pretended to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going to get my squadron as a wedding present,\" he rattled on.\n",
      "\"Captain and Mrs. Louis Castaigne, eh, Hildred?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he told me where it was to be and who were to be there, and made me\n",
      "promise to come and be best man. I set my teeth and listened to his\n",
      "boyish chatter without showing what I felt, but--\n",
      "\n",
      "I was getting to the limit of my endurance, and when he jumped up, and,\n",
      "switching his spurs till they jingled, said he must go, I did not detain\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's one thing I want to ask of you,\" I said quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Out with it, it's promised,\" he laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want you to meet me for a quarter of an hour's talk to-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, if you wish,\" he said, somewhat puzzled. \"Where?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anywhere, in the park there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What time, Hildred?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Midnight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What in the name of--\" he began, but checked himself and laughingly\n",
      "assented. I watched him go down the stairs and hurry away, his sabre\n",
      "banging at every stride. He turned into Bleecker Street, and I knew he\n",
      "was going to see Constance. I gave him ten minutes to disappear and then\n",
      "followed in his footsteps, taking with me the jewelled crown and the\n",
      "silken robe embroidered with the Yellow Sign. When I turned into Bleecker\n",
      "Street, and entered the doorway which bore the sign--\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. WILDE,\n",
      "REPAIRER OF REPUTATIONS.\n",
      "Third Bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw old Hawberk moving about in his shop, and imagined I heard\n",
      "Constance's voice in the parlour; but I avoided them both and hurried up\n",
      "the trembling stairways to Mr. Wilde's apartment. I knocked and entered\n",
      "without ceremony. Mr. Wilde lay groaning on the floor, his face covered\n",
      "with blood, his clothes torn to shreds. Drops of blood were scattered\n",
      "about over the carpet, which had also been ripped and frayed in the\n",
      "evidently recent struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's that cursed cat,\" he said, ceasing his groans, and turning his\n",
      "colourless eyes to me; \"she attacked me while I was asleep. I believe she\n",
      "will kill me yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was too much, so I went into the kitchen, and, seizing a hatchet\n",
      "from the pantry, started to find the infernal beast and settle her then\n",
      "and there. My search was fruitless, and after a while I gave it up and\n",
      "came back to find Mr. Wilde squatting on his high chair by the table. He\n",
      "had washed his face and changed his clothes. The great furrows which the\n",
      "cat's claws had ploughed up in his face he had filled with collodion, and\n",
      "a rag hid the wound in his throat. I told him I should kill the cat when\n",
      "I came across her, but he only shook his head and turned to the open\n",
      "ledger before him. He read name after name of the people who had come to\n",
      "him in regard to their reputation, and the sums he had amassed were\n",
      "startling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I put on the screws now and then,\" he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One day or other some of these people will assassinate you,\" I insisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think so?\" he said, rubbing his mutilated ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was useless to argue with him, so I took down the manuscript entitled\n",
      "Imperial Dynasty of America, for the last time I should ever take it down\n",
      "in Mr. Wilde's study. I read it through, thrilling and trembling with\n",
      "pleasure. When I had finished Mr. Wilde took the manuscript and, turning\n",
      "to the dark passage which leads from his study to his bed-chamber,\n",
      "called out in a loud voice, \"Vance.\" Then for the first time, I noticed a\n",
      "man crouching there in the shadow. How I had overlooked him during my\n",
      "search for the cat, I cannot imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Vance, come in,\" cried Mr. Wilde.\n",
      "\n",
      "The figure rose and crept towards us, and I shall never forget the face\n",
      "that he raised to mine, as the light from the window illuminated it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Vance, this is Mr. Castaigne,\" said Mr. Wilde. Before he had finished\n",
      "speaking, the man threw himself on the ground before the table, crying\n",
      "and grasping, \"Oh, God! Oh, my God! Help me! Forgive me! Oh, Mr.\n",
      "Castaigne, keep that man away. You cannot, you cannot mean it! You are\n",
      "different--save me! I am broken down--I was in a madhouse and now--when\n",
      "all was coming right--when I had forgotten the King--the King in Yellow\n",
      "and--but I shall go mad again--I shall go mad--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice died into a choking rattle, for Mr. Wilde had leapt on him and\n",
      "his right hand encircled the man's throat. When Vance fell in a heap on\n",
      "the floor, Mr. Wilde clambered nimbly into his chair again, and rubbing\n",
      "his mangled ears with the stump of his hand, turned to me and asked me\n",
      "for the ledger. I reached it down from the shelf and he opened it. After\n",
      "a moment's searching among the beautifully written pages, he coughed\n",
      "complacently, and pointed to the name Vance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Vance,\" he read aloud, \"Osgood Oswald Vance.\" At the sound of his name,\n",
      "the man on the floor raised his head and turned a convulsed face to Mr.\n",
      "Wilde. His eyes were injected with blood, his lips tumefied. \"Called\n",
      "April 28th,\" continued Mr. Wilde. \"Occupation, cashier in the Seaforth\n",
      "National Bank; has served a term of forgery at Sing Sing, from whence he\n",
      "was transferred to the Asylum for the Criminal Insane. Pardoned by the\n",
      "Governor of New York, and discharged from the Asylum, January 19, 1918.\n",
      "Reputation damaged at Sheepshead Bay. Rumours that he lives beyond his\n",
      "income. Reputation to be repaired at once. Retainer $1,500.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Note.--Has embezzled sums amounting to $30,000 since March 20, 1919,\n",
      "excellent family, and secured present position through uncle's influence.\n",
      "Father, President of Seaforth Bank.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked at the man on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get up, Vance,\" said Mr. Wilde in a gentle voice. Vance rose as if\n",
      "hypnotized. \"He will do as we suggest now,\" observed Mr. Wilde, and\n",
      "opening the manuscript, he read the entire history of the Imperial\n",
      "Dynasty of America. Then in a kind and soothing murmur he ran over the\n",
      "important points with Vance, who stood like one stunned. His eyes were so\n",
      "blank and vacant that I imagined he had become half-witted, and remarked\n",
      "it to Mr. Wilde who replied that it was of no consequence anyway. Very\n",
      "patiently we pointed out to Vance what his share in the affair would be,\n",
      "and he seemed to understand after a while. Mr. Wilde explained the\n",
      "manuscript, using several volumes on Heraldry, to substantiate the result\n",
      "of his researches. He mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in\n",
      "Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of\n",
      "the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy\n",
      "depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. \"The scolloped tatters of the King\n",
      "in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever,\" he muttered, but I do not believe\n",
      "Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of\n",
      "the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of\n",
      "Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he\n",
      "began the wonderful story of the Last King. Fascinated and thrilled I\n",
      "watched him. He threw up his head, his long arms were stretched out in a\n",
      "magnificent gesture of pride and power, and his eyes blazed deep in their\n",
      "sockets like two emeralds. Vance listened stupefied. As for me, when at\n",
      "last Mr. Wilde had finished, and pointing to me, cried, \"The cousin of\n",
      "the King!\" my head swam with excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlling myself with a superhuman effort, I explained to Vance why I\n",
      "alone was worthy of the crown and why my cousin must be exiled or die.\n",
      "I made him understand that my cousin must never marry, even after\n",
      "renouncing all his claims, and how that least of all he should marry the\n",
      "daughter of the Marquis of Avonshire and bring England into the question.\n",
      "I showed him a list of thousands of names which Mr. Wilde had drawn up;\n",
      "every man whose name was there had received the Yellow Sign which no\n",
      "living human being dared disregard. The city, the state, the whole land,\n",
      "were ready to rise and tremble before the Pallid Mask.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time had come, the people should know the son of Hastur, and the\n",
      "whole world bow to the black stars which hang in the sky over Carcosa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vance leaned on the table, his head buried in his hands. Mr. Wilde drew\n",
      "a rough sketch on the margin of yesterday's _Herald_ with a bit of\n",
      "lead pencil. It was a plan of Hawberk's rooms. Then he wrote out the\n",
      "order and affixed the seal, and shaking like a palsied man I signed my\n",
      "first writ of execution with my name Hildred-Rex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wilde clambered to the floor and unlocking the cabinet, took a long\n",
      "square box from the first shelf. This he brought to the table and opened.\n",
      "A new knife lay in the tissue paper inside and I picked it up and handed\n",
      "it to Vance, along with the order and the plan of Hawberk's apartment.\n",
      "Then Mr. Wilde told Vance he could go; and he went, shambling like an\n",
      "outcast of the slums.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat for a while watching the daylight fade behind the square tower of\n",
      "the Judson Memorial Church, and finally, gathering up the manuscript and\n",
      "notes, took my hat and started for the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wilde watched me in silence. When I had stepped into the hall I\n",
      "looked back. Mr. Wilde's small eyes were still fixed on me. Behind him,\n",
      "the shadows gathered in the fading light. Then I closed the door behind\n",
      "me and went out into the darkening streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had eaten nothing since breakfast, but I was not hungry. A wretched,\n",
      "half-starved creature, who stood looking across the street at the Lethal\n",
      "Chamber, noticed me and came up to tell me a tale of misery. I gave him\n",
      "money, I don't know why, and he went away without thanking me. An\n",
      "hour later another outcast approached and whined his story. I had a blank\n",
      "bit of paper in my pocket, on which was traced the Yellow Sign, and I\n",
      "handed it to him. He looked at it stupidly for a moment, and then with an\n",
      "uncertain glance at me, folded it with what seemed to me exaggerated care\n",
      "and placed it in his bosom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electric lights were sparkling among the trees, and the new moon\n",
      "shone in the sky above the Lethal Chamber. It was tiresome waiting in the\n",
      "square; I wandered from the Marble Arch to the artillery stables and back\n",
      "again to the lotos fountain. The flowers and grass exhaled a fragrance\n",
      "which troubled me. The jet of the fountain played in the moonlight, and\n",
      "the musical splash of falling drops reminded me of the tinkle of chained\n",
      "mail in Hawberk's shop. But it was not so fascinating, and the dull\n",
      "sparkle of the moonlight on the water brought no such sensations of\n",
      "exquisite pleasure, as when the sunshine played over the polished steel\n",
      "of a corselet on Hawberk's knee. I watched the bats darting and turning\n",
      "above the water plants in the fountain basin, but their rapid, jerky\n",
      "flight set my nerves on edge, and I went away again to walk aimlessly to\n",
      "and fro among the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The artillery stables were dark, but in the cavalry barracks the\n",
      "officers' windows were brilliantly lighted, and the sallyport was\n",
      "constantly filled with troopers in fatigue, carrying straw and harness\n",
      "and baskets filled with tin dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice the mounted sentry at the gates was changed while I wandered up and\n",
      "down the asphalt walk. I looked at my watch. It was nearly time. The\n",
      "lights in the barracks went out one by one, the barred gate was closed,\n",
      "and every minute or two an officer passed in through the side wicket,\n",
      "leaving a rattle of accoutrements and a jingle of spurs on the night air.\n",
      "The square had become very silent. The last homeless loiterer had been\n",
      "driven away by the grey-coated park policeman, the car tracks along\n",
      "Wooster Street were deserted, and the only sound which broke the\n",
      "stillness was the stamping of the sentry's horse and the ring of his\n",
      "sabre against the saddle pommel. In the barracks, the officers' quarters\n",
      "were still lighted, and military servants passed and repassed before the\n",
      "bay windows. Twelve o'clock sounded from the new spire of St. Francis\n",
      "Xavier, and at the last stroke of the sad-toned bell a figure passed\n",
      "through the wicket beside the portcullis, returned the salute of the\n",
      "sentry, and crossing the street entered the square and advanced toward\n",
      "the Benedick apartment house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Louis,\" I called.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man pivoted on his spurred heels and came straight toward me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that you, Hildred?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you are on time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I took his offered hand, and we strolled toward the Lethal Chamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rattled on about his wedding and the graces of Constance, and their\n",
      "future prospects, calling my attention to his captain's shoulder-straps,\n",
      "and the triple gold arabesque on his sleeve and fatigue cap. I believe I\n",
      "listened as much to the music of his spurs and sabre as I did to his\n",
      "boyish babble, and at last we stood under the elms on the Fourth Street\n",
      "corner of the square opposite the Lethal Chamber. Then he laughed and\n",
      "asked me what I wanted with him. I motioned him to a seat on a bench\n",
      "under the electric light, and sat down beside him. He looked at me\n",
      "curiously, with that same searching glance which I hate and fear so in\n",
      "doctors. I felt the insult of his look, but he did not know it, and I\n",
      "carefully concealed my feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, old chap,\" he inquired, \"what can I do for you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I drew from my pocket the manuscript and notes of the Imperial Dynasty\n",
      "of America, and looking him in the eye said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will tell you. On your word as a soldier, promise me to read this\n",
      "manuscript from beginning to end, without asking me a question. Promise\n",
      "me to read these notes in the same way, and promise me to listen to what\n",
      "I have to tell later.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I promise, if you wish it,\" he said pleasantly. \"Give me the paper,\n",
      "Hildred.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He began to read, raising his eyebrows with a puzzled, whimsical air,\n",
      "which made me tremble with suppressed anger. As he advanced his, eyebrows\n",
      "contracted, and his lips seemed to form the word \"rubbish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he looked slightly bored, but apparently for my sake read, with an\n",
      "attempt at interest, which presently ceased to be an effort He started\n",
      "when in the closely written pages he came to his own name, and when he\n",
      "came to mine he lowered the paper, and looked sharply at me for a moment\n",
      "But he kept his word, and resumed his reading, and I let the half-formed\n",
      "question die on his lips unanswered. When he came to the end and read the\n",
      "signature of Mr. Wilde, he folded the paper carefully and returned it to\n",
      "me. I handed him the notes, and he settled back, pushing his fatigue cap\n",
      "up to his forehead, with a boyish gesture, which I remembered so well in\n",
      "school. I watched his face as he read, and when he finished I took the\n",
      "notes with the manuscript, and placed them in my pocket. Then I unfolded\n",
      "a scroll marked with the Yellow Sign. He saw the sign, but he did not\n",
      "seem to recognize it, and I called his attention to it somewhat sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" he said, \"I see it. What is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is the Yellow Sign,\" I said angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that's it, is it?\" said Louis, in that flattering voice, which\n",
      "Doctor Archer used to employ with me, and would probably have employed\n",
      "again, had I not settled his affair for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I kept my rage down and answered as steadily as possible, \"Listen, you\n",
      "have engaged your word?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am listening, old chap,\" he replied soothingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I began to speak very calmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dr. Archer, having by some means become possessed of the secret of the\n",
      "Imperial Succession, attempted to deprive me of my right, alleging that\n",
      "because of a fall from my horse four years ago, I had become mentally\n",
      "deficient. He presumed to place me under restraint in his own house in\n",
      "hopes of either driving me insane or poisoning me. I have not forgotten\n",
      "it. I visited him last night and the interview was final.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Louis turned quite pale, but did not move. I resumed triumphantly, \"There\n",
      "are yet three people to be interviewed in the interests of Mr. Wilde and\n",
      "myself. They are my cousin Louis, Mr. Hawberk, and his daughter\n",
      "Constance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Louis sprang to his feet and I arose also, and flung the paper marked\n",
      "with the Yellow Sign to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't need that to tell you what I have to say,\" I cried, with a\n",
      "laugh of triumph. \"You must renounce the crown to me, do you hear, to\n",
      "_me_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Louis looked at me with a startled air, but recovering himself said\n",
      "kindly, \"Of course I renounce the--what is it I must renounce?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The crown,\" I said angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" he answered, \"I renounce it. Come, old chap, I'll walk back\n",
      "to your rooms with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't try any of your doctor's tricks on me,\" I cried, trembling with\n",
      "fury. \"Don't act as if you think I am insane.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What nonsense,\" he replied. \"Come, it's getting late, Hildred.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" I shouted, \"you must listen. You cannot marry, I forbid it. Do you\n",
      "hear? I forbid it. You shall renounce the crown, and in reward I grant\n",
      "you exile, but if you refuse you shall die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He tried to calm me, but I was roused at last, and drawing my long knife\n",
      "barred his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I told him how they would find Dr. Archer in the cellar with his\n",
      "throat open, and I laughed in his face when I thought of Vance and his\n",
      "knife, and the order signed by me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, you are the King,\" I cried, \"but I shall be King. Who are you to\n",
      "keep me from Empire over all the habitable earth! I was born the cousin\n",
      "of a king, but I shall be King!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Louis stood white and rigid before me. Suddenly a man came running up\n",
      "Fourth Street, entered the gate of the Lethal Temple, traversed the path\n",
      "to the bronze doors at full speed, and plunged into the death chamber\n",
      "with the cry of one demented, and I laughed until I wept tears, for I had\n",
      "recognized Vance, and knew that Hawberk and his daughter were no longer\n",
      "in my way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go,\" I cried to Louis, \"you have ceased to be a menace. You will never\n",
      "marry Constance now, and if you marry any one else in your exile, I will\n",
      "visit you as I did my doctor last night. Mr. Wilde takes charge of you\n",
      "to-morrow.\" Then I turned and darted into South Fifth Avenue, and with a\n",
      "cry of terror Louis dropped his belt and sabre and followed me like the\n",
      "wind. I heard him close behind me at the corner of Bleecker Street, and I\n",
      "dashed into the doorway under Hawberk's sign. He cried, \"Halt, or I\n",
      "fire!\" but when he saw that I flew up the stairs leaving Hawberk's shop\n",
      "below, he left me, and I heard him hammering and shouting at their door\n",
      "as though it were possible to arouse the dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wilde's door was open, and I entered crying, \"It is done, it is done!\n",
      "Let the nations rise and look upon their King!\" but I could not find Mr.\n",
      "Wilde, so I went to the cabinet and took the splendid diadem from its\n",

      "and crimson played over the surface, and then what seemed to be a ray of\n",

      "\n",
      "The \"Madonna,\" an exquisite marble for which Geneviève had sat, had been\n",

      "world would expect something better of him than that. Still, it was\n",
      "impossible now to think of finishing in time for the Salon that splendid\n",

      "strength of his having been born in America, although his father was\n",
      "French and his mother was a Russian. Every one in the Beaux Arts called\n",
      "him Boris. And yet there were only two of us whom he addressed in the\n",

      "The perfect cordiality of that interview did not deceive either of us, I\n",

      "knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Geneviève was lovely. The Madonna-like purity of her face might have been\n",
      "inspired by the Sanctus in Gounod's Mass. But I was always glad when she\n",
      "changed that mood for what we called her \"April Manoeuvres.\" She was\n",
      "often as variable as an April day. In the morning grave, dignified and\n",
      "sweet, at noon laughing, capricious, at evening whatever one least\n",
      "expected. I preferred her so rather than in that Madonna-like\n",
      "tranquillity which stirred the depths of my heart. I was dreaming of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"This new vicious discovery would corrupt the world of art. No, I shall\n",
      "never confide the secret to any one,\" he said slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be hard to find any one less informed about such phenomena than\n",
      "myself; but of course I had heard of mineral springs so saturated with\n",
      "silica that the leaves and twigs which fell into them were turned to\n",
      "stone after a time. I dimly comprehended the process, how the silica\n",
      "replaced the vegetable matter, atom by atom, and the result was a\n",
      "duplicate of the object in stone. This, I confess, had never interested\n",
      "me greatly, and as for the ancient fossils thus produced, they disgusted\n",
      "me. Boris, it appeared, feeling curiosity instead of repugnance, had\n",
      "investigated the subject, and had accidentally stumbled on a solution\n",
      "which, attacking the immersed object with a ferocity unheard of, in a\n",
      "second did the work of years. This was all I could make out of the\n",
      "strange story he had just been telling me. He spoke again after a long\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am almost frightened when I think what I have found. Scientists would\n",
      "go mad over the discovery. It was so simple too; it discovered itself.\n",

      "\"What new element?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I haven't thought of naming it, and I don't believe I ever shall.\n",
      "There are enough precious metals now in the world to cut throats over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I pricked up my ears. \"Have you struck gold, Boris?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, better;--but see here, Alec!\" he laughed, starting up. \"You and I\n",
      "have all we need in this world. Ah! how sinister and covetous you look\n",
      "already!\" I laughed too, and told him I was devoured by the desire for\n",
      "gold, and we had better talk of something else; so when Geneviève came in\n",
      "shortly after, we had turned our backs on alchemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Geneviève was dressed in silvery grey from head to foot. The light\n",
      "glinted along the soft curves of her fair hair as she turned her cheek to\n",
      "Boris; then she saw me and returned my greeting. She had never before\n",
      "failed to blow me a kiss from the tips of her white fingers, and I\n",
      "promptly complained of the omission. She smiled and held out her hand,\n",
      "which dropped almost before it had touched mine; then she said, looking\n",
      "at Boris--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must ask Alec to stay for luncheon.\" This also was something new.\n",
      "She had always asked me herself until to-day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did,\" said Boris shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you said yes, I hope?\" She turned to me with a charming conventional\n",
      "smile. I might have been an acquaintance of the day before yesterday. I\n",
      "made her a low bow. \"J'avais bien l'honneur, madame,\" but refusing to\n",
      "take up our usual bantering tone, she murmured a hospitable commonplace\n",
      "and disappeared. Boris and I looked at one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had better go home, don't you think?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hanged if I know,\" he replied frankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we were discussing the advisability of my departure Geneviève\n",
      "reappeared in the doorway without her bonnet. She was wonderfully\n",
      "beautiful, but her colour was too deep and her lovely eyes were too\n",
      "bright. She came straight up to me and took my arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Luncheon is ready. Was I cross, Alec? I thought I had a headache, but I\n",
      "haven't. Come here, Boris;\" and she slipped her other arm through his.\n",
      "\"Alec knows that after you there is no one in the world whom I like as\n",
      "well as I like him, so if he sometimes feels snubbed it won't hurt him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"À la bonheur!\" I cried, \"who says there are no thunderstorms in April?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you ready?\" chanted Boris. \"Aye ready;\" and arm-in-arm we raced into\n",
      "the dining-room, scandalizing the servants. After all we were not so much\n",
      "to blame; Geneviève was eighteen, Boris was twenty-three, and I not quite\n",
      "twenty-one.\n",

      "Some work that I was doing about this time on the decorations for\n",
      "Geneviève's boudoir kept me constantly at the quaint little hotel in the\n",
      "Rue Sainte-Cécile. Boris and I in those days laboured hard but as we\n",
      "pleased, which was fitfully, and we all three, with Jack Scott, idled a\n",
      "great deal together.\n",
      "\n",
      "One quiet afternoon I had been wandering alone over the house examining\n",
      "curios, prying into odd corners, bringing out sweetmeats and cigars from\n",
      "strange hiding-places, and at last I stopped in the bathing-room. Boris,\n",
      "all over clay, stood there washing his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was built of rose-coloured marble excepting the floor, which was\n",
      "tessellated in rose and grey. In the centre was a square pool sunken\n",
      "below the surface of the floor; steps led down into it, sculptured\n",
      "pillars supported a frescoed ceiling. A delicious marble Cupid appeared\n",
      "to have just alighted on his pedestal at the upper end of the room. The\n",
      "whole interior was Boris' work and mine. Boris, in his working-clothes of\n",
      "white canvas, scraped the traces of clay and red modelling wax from his\n",
      "handsome hands, and coquetted over his shoulder with the Cupid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see you,\" he insisted, \"don't try to look the other way and pretend\n",
      "not to see me. You know who made you, little humbug!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was always my rôle to interpret Cupid's sentiments in these\n",
      "conversations, and when my turn came I responded in such a manner, that\n",
      "Boris seized my arm and dragged me toward the pool, declaring he would\n",
      "duck me. Next instant he dropped my arm and turned pale. \"Good God!\" he\n",
      "said, \"I forgot the pool is full of the solution!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I shivered a little, and dryly advised him to remember better where he\n",
      "had stored the precious liquid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In Heaven's name, why do you keep a small lake of that gruesome stuff\n",
      "here of all places?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to experiment on something large,\" he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On me, for instance?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! that came too close for jesting; but I do want to watch the action\n",
      "of that solution on a more highly organized living body; there is that\n",
      "big white rabbit,\" he said, following me into the studio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jack Scott, wearing a paint-stained jacket, came wandering in,\n",
      "appropriated all the Oriental sweetmeats he could lay his hands on,\n",
      "looted the cigarette case, and finally he and Boris disappeared together\n",
      "to visit the Luxembourg Gallery, where a new silver bronze by Rodin and a\n",
      "landscape of Monet's were claiming the exclusive attention of artistic\n",
      "France. I went back to the studio, and resumed my work. It was a\n",
      "Renaissance screen, which Boris wanted me to paint for Geneviève's\n",
      "boudoir. But the small boy who was unwillingly dawdling through a series\n",
      "of poses for it, to-day refused all bribes to be good. He never rested an\n",
      "instant in the same position, and inside of five minutes I had as many\n",
      "different outlines of the little beggar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you posing, or are you executing a song and dance, my friend?\" I\n",
      "inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whichever monsieur pleases,\" he replied, with an angelic smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I dismissed him for the day, and of course I paid him for the\n",
      "full time, that being the way we spoil our models.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the young imp had gone, I made a few perfunctory daubs at my work,\n",
      "but was so thoroughly out of humour, that it took me the rest of the\n",
      "afternoon to undo the damage I had done, so at last I scraped my palette,\n",
      "stuck my brushes in a bowl of black soap, and strolled into the\n",
      "smoking-room. I really believe that, excepting Geneviève's apartments, no\n",
      "room in the house was so free from the perfume of tobacco as this one. It\n",
      "was a queer chaos of odds and ends, hung with threadbare tapestry. A\n",
      "sweet-toned old spinet in good repair stood by the window. There were\n",
      "stands of weapons, some old and dull, others bright and modern, festoons\n",
      "of Indian and Turkish armour over the mantel, two or three good pictures,\n",
      "and a pipe-rack. It was here that we used to come for new sensations in\n",
      "smoking. I doubt if any type of pipe ever existed which was not\n",
      "represented in that rack. When we had selected one, we immediately\n",
      "carried it somewhere else and smoked it; for the place was, on the whole,\n",
      "more gloomy and less inviting than any in the house. But this afternoon,\n",
      "the twilight was very soothing, the rugs and skins on the floor looked\n",
      "brown and soft and drowsy; the big couch was piled with cushions--I found\n",
      "my pipe and curled up there for an unaccustomed smoke in the\n",
      "smoking-room. I had chosen one with a long flexible stem, and lighting it\n",
      "fell to dreaming. After a while it went out, but I did not stir. I\n",
      "dreamed on and presently fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "I awoke to the saddest music I had ever heard. The room was quite dark, I\n",
      "had no idea what time it was. A ray of moonlight silvered one edge of the\n",
      "old spinet, and the polished wood seemed to exhale the sounds as perfume\n",
      "floats above a box of sandalwood. Some one rose in the darkness, and came\n",
      "away weeping quietly, and I was fool enough to cry out \"Geneviève!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She dropped at my voice, and, I had time to curse myself while I made a\n",
      "light and tried to raise her from the floor. She shrank away with a\n",
      "murmur of pain. She was very quiet, and asked for Boris. I carried her to\n",
      "the divan, and went to look for him, but he was not in the house, and the\n",
      "servants were gone to bed. Perplexed and anxious, I hurried back to\n",
      "Geneviève. She lay where I had left her, looking very white.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't find Boris nor any of the servants,\" I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know,\" she answered faintly, \"Boris has gone to Ept with Mr. Scott. I\n",
      "did not remember when I sent you for him just now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But he can't get back in that case before to-morrow afternoon, and--are\n",
      "you hurt? Did I frighten you into falling? What an awful fool I am, but I\n",
      "was only half awake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Boris thought you had gone home before dinner. Do please excuse us for\n",
      "letting you stay here all this time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have had a long nap,\" I laughed, \"so sound that I did not know whether\n",

      "\n",
      "I would tell a thousand more lies worse than that one to see the look of\n",
      "relief that came into her face. She smiled adorably, and said in her\n",
      "natural voice: \"Alec, I tripped on that wolf's head, and I think my ankle\n",

      "Boris leaned against the door of his studio, looking down, his hands in\n",
      "his pockets, his kind, keen eyes clouded, a new line of trouble drawn\n",
      "\"over the mouth's good mark, that made the smile.\" The maid had orders to\n",
      "summon him the instant Geneviève opened her eyes. We waited and waited,\n",
      "and Boris, growing restless, wandered about, fussing with modelling wax\n",
      "and red clay. Suddenly he started for the next room. \"Come and see my\n",
      "rose-coloured bath full of death!\" he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it death?\" I asked, to humour his mood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not prepared to call it life, I suppose,\" he answered. As he\n",
      "spoke he plucked a solitary goldfish squirming and twisting out of its\n",
      "globe. \"We'll send this one after the other--wherever that is,\" he said.\n",
      "There was feverish excitement in his voice. A dull weight of fever lay on\n",
      "my limbs and on my brain as I followed him to the fair crystal pool with\n",
      "its pink-tinted sides; and he dropped the creature in. Falling, its\n",
      "scales flashed with a hot orange gleam in its angry twistings and\n",
      "contortions; the moment it struck the liquid it became rigid and sank\n",
      "heavily to the bottom. Then came the milky foam, the splendid hues\n",
      "radiating on the surface and then the shaft of pure serene light broke\n",
      "through from seemingly infinite depths. Boris plunged in his hand and\n",
      "drew out an exquisite marble thing, blue-veined, rose-tinted, and\n",
      "glistening with opalescent drops.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Child's play,\" he muttered, and looked wearily, longingly at me,--as if\n",
      "I could answer such questions! But Jack Scott came in and entered into\n",
      "the \"game,\" as he called it, with ardour. Nothing would do but to try the\n",
      "experiment on the white rabbit then and there. I was willing that Boris\n",
      "should find distraction from his cares, but I hated to see the life go\n",
      "out of a warm, living creature and I declined to be present. Picking up a\n",
      "book at random, I sat down in the studio to read. Alas! I had found\n",
      "_The King in Yellow_. After a few moments, which seemed ages, I was\n",
      "putting it away with a nervous shudder, when Boris and Jack came in\n",
      "bringing their marble rabbit. At the same time the bell rang above, and a\n",
      "cry came from the sick-room. Boris was gone like a flash, and the next\n",
      "moment he called, \"Jack, run for the doctor; bring him back with you.\n",
      "Alec, come here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I went and stood at her door. A frightened maid came out in haste and ran\n",
      "away to fetch some remedy. Geneviève, sitting bolt upright, with crimson\n",
      "cheeks and glittering eyes, babbled incessantly and resisted Boris'\n",
      "gentle restraint. He called me to help. At my first touch she sighed and\n",
      "sank back, closing her eyes, and then--then--as we still bent above her,\n",
      "she opened them again, looked straight into Boris' face--poor\n",
      "fever-crazed girl!--and told her secret. At the same instant our three\n",
      "lives turned into new channels; the bond that held us so long together\n",
      "snapped for ever and a new bond was forged in its place, for she had\n",
      "spoken my name, and as the fever tortured her, her heart poured out its\n",
      "load of hidden sorrow. Amazed and dumb I bowed my head, while my face\n",
      "burned like a live coal, and the blood surged in my ears, stupefying me\n",
      "with its clamour. Incapable of movement, incapable of speech, I listened\n",
      "to her feverish words in an agony of shame and sorrow. I could not\n",
      "silence her, I could not look at Boris. Then I felt an arm upon my\n",
      "shoulder, and Boris turned a bloodless face to mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not your fault, Alec; don't grieve so if she loves you--\" but he\n",
      "could not finish; and as the doctor stepped swiftly into the room,\n",
      "saying--\"Ah, the fever!\" I seized Jack Scott and hurried him to the\n",
      "street, saying, \"Boris would rather be alone.\" We crossed the street to\n",
      "our own apartments, and that night, seeing I was going to be ill too, he\n",
      "went for the doctor again. The last thing I recollect with any\n",
      "distinctness was hearing Jack say, \"For Heaven's sake, doctor, what ails\n",
      "him, to wear a face like that?\" and I thought of _The King in\n",
      "Yellow_ and the Pallid Mask.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was very ill, for the strain of two years which I had endured since\n",
      "that fatal May morning when Geneviève murmured, \"I love you, but I think\n",
      "I love Boris best,\" told on me at last. I had never imagined that it\n",
      "could become more than I could endure. Outwardly tranquil, I had deceived\n",
      "myself. Although the inward battle raged night after night, and I, lying\n",
      "alone in my room, cursed myself for rebellious thoughts unloyal to Boris\n",
      "and unworthy of Geneviève, the morning always brought relief, and I\n",
      "returned to Geneviève and to my dear Boris with a heart washed clean by\n",
      "the tempests of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never in word or deed or thought while with them had I betrayed my sorrow\n",
      "even to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mask of self-deception was no longer a mask for me, it was a part of\n",
      "me. Night lifted it, laying bare the stifled truth below; but there was\n",
      "no one to see except myself, and when the day broke the mask fell back\n",
      "again of its own accord. These thoughts passed through my troubled mind\n",
      "as I lay sick, but they were hopelessly entangled with visions of white\n",
      "creatures, heavy as stone, crawling about in Boris' basin,--of the wolf's\n",
      "head on the rug, foaming and snapping at Geneviève, who lay smiling\n",
      "beside it. I thought, too, of the King in Yellow wrapped in the fantastic\n",
      "colours of his tattered mantle, and that bitter cry of Cassilda, \"Not\n",
      "upon us, oh King, not upon us!\" Feverishly I struggled to put it from me,\n",
      "but I saw the lake of Hali, thin and blank, without a ripple or wind to\n",
      "stir it, and I saw the towers of Carcosa behind the moon. Aldebaran, the\n",
      "Hyades, Alar, Hastur, glided through the cloud-rifts which fluttered and\n",
      "flapped as they passed like the scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow.\n",
      "Among all these, one sane thought persisted. It never wavered, no matter\n",
      "what else was going on in my disordered mind, that my chief reason for\n",
      "existing was to meet some requirement of Boris and Geneviève. What this\n",
      "obligation was, its nature, was never clear; sometimes it seemed to be\n",
      "protection, sometimes support, through a great crisis. Whatever it seemed\n",
      "to be for the time, its weight rested only on me, and I was never so ill\n",
      "or so weak that I did not respond with my whole soul. There were always\n",
      "crowds of faces about me, mostly strange, but a few I recognized, Boris\n",
      "among them. Afterward they told me that this could not have been, but I\n",
      "know that once at least he bent over me. It was only a touch, a faint\n",
      "echo of his voice, then the clouds settled back on my senses, and I lost\n",
      "him, but he _did_ stand there and bend over me _once_ at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, one morning I awoke to find the sunlight falling across my bed,\n",
      "and Jack Scott reading beside me. I had not strength enough to speak\n",
      "aloud, neither could I think, much less remember, but I could smile\n",
      "feebly, as Jack's eye met mine, and when he jumped up and asked eagerly\n",
      "if I wanted anything, I could whisper, \"Yes--Boris.\" Jack moved to the\n",
      "head of my bed, and leaned down to arrange my pillow: I did not see his\n",
      "face, but he answered heartily, \"You must wait, Alec; you are too weak to\n",
      "see even Boris.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I waited and I grew strong; in a few days I was able to see whom I would,\n",
      "but meanwhile I had thought and remembered. From the moment when all the\n",
      "past grew clear again in my mind, I never doubted what I should do when\n",
      "the time came, and I felt sure that Boris would have resolved upon the\n",
      "same course so far as he was concerned; as for what pertained to me\n",
      "alone, I knew he would see that also as I did. I no longer asked for any\n",
      "one. I never inquired why no message came from them; why during the week\n",
      "I lay there, waiting and growing stronger, I never heard their name\n",
      "spoken. Preoccupied with my own searchings for the right way, and with my\n",
      "feeble but determined fight against despair, I simply acquiesced in\n",
      "Jack's reticence, taking for granted that he was afraid to speak of them,\n",
      "lest I should turn unruly and insist on seeing them. Meanwhile I said\n",
      "over and over to myself, how would it be when life began again for us\n",
      "all? We would take up our relations exactly as they were before Geneviève\n",
      "fell ill. Boris and I would look into each other's eyes, and there would\n",
      "be neither rancour nor cowardice nor mistrust in that glance. I would be\n",
      "with them again for a little while in the dear intimacy of their home,\n",
      "and then, without pretext or explanation, I would disappear from their\n",
      "lives for ever. Boris would know; Geneviève--the only comfort was that\n",
      "she would never know. It seemed, as I thought it over, that I had found\n",
      "the meaning of that sense of obligation which had persisted all through\n",
      "my delirium, and the only possible answer to it. So, when I was quite\n",
      "ready, I beckoned Jack to me one day, and said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jack, I want Boris at once; and take my dearest greeting to\n",
      "Geneviève....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When at last he made me understand that they were both dead, I fell into\n",
      "a wild rage that tore all my little convalescent strength to atoms. I\n",
      "raved and cursed myself into a relapse, from which I crawled forth some\n",
      "weeks afterward a boy of twenty-one who believed that his youth was gone\n",
      "for ever. I seemed to be past the capability of further suffering, and\n",
      "one day when Jack handed me a letter and the keys to Boris' house, I took\n",
      "them without a tremor and asked him to tell me all. It was cruel of me to\n",
      "ask him, but there was no help for it, and he leaned wearily on his thin\n",
      "hands, to reopen the wound which could never entirely heal. He began very\n",
      "quietly--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alec, unless you have a clue that I know nothing about, you will not be\n",
      "able to explain any more than I what has happened. I suspect that you\n",
      "would rather not hear these details, but you must learn them, else I\n",
      "would spare you the relation. God knows I wish I could be spared the\n",
      "telling. I shall use few words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That day when I left you in the doctor's care and came back to Boris, I\n",
      "found him working on the 'Fates.' Geneviève, he said, was sleeping under\n",
      "the influence of drugs. She had been quite out of her mind, he said. He\n",
      "kept on working, not talking any more, and I watched him. Before long, I\n",
      "saw that the third figure of the group--the one looking straight ahead,\n",
      "out over the world--bore his face; not as you ever saw it, but as it\n",
      "looked then and to the end. This is one thing for which I should like to\n",
      "find an explanation, but I never shall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, he worked and I watched him in silence, and we went on that way\n",
      "until nearly midnight. Then we heard the door open and shut sharply, and\n",
      "a swift rush in the next room. Boris sprang through the doorway and I\n",
      "followed; but we were too late. She lay at the bottom of the pool, her\n",
      "hands across her breast. Then Boris shot himself through the heart.\" Jack\n",
      "stopped speaking, drops of sweat stood under his eyes, and his thin\n",
      "cheeks twitched. \"I carried Boris to his room. Then I went back and let\n",
      "that hellish fluid out of the pool, and turning on all the water, washed\n",
      "the marble clean of every drop. When at length I dared descend the steps,\n",
      "I found her lying there as white as snow. At last, when I had decided\n",
      "what was best to do, I went into the laboratory, and first emptied the\n",
      "solution in the basin into the waste-pipe; then I poured the contents of\n",
      "every jar and bottle after it. There was wood in the fire-place, so I\n",
      "built a fire, and breaking the locks of Boris' cabinet I burnt every\n",
      "paper, notebook and letter that I found there. With a mallet from the\n",
      "studio I smashed to pieces all the empty bottles, then loading them into\n",
      "a coal-scuttle, I carried them to the cellar and threw them over the\n",
      "red-hot bed of the furnace. Six times I made the journey, and at last,\n",
      "not a vestige remained of anything which might again aid in seeking for\n",
      "the formula which Boris had found. Then at last I dared call the doctor.\n",
      "He is a good man, and together we struggled to keep it from the public.\n",
      "Without him I never could have succeeded. At last we got the servants\n",
      "paid and sent away into the country, where old Rosier keeps them quiet\n",
      "with stones of Boris' and Geneviève's travels in distant lands, from\n",
      "whence they will not return for years. We buried Boris in the little\n",
      "cemetery of Sèvres. The doctor is a good creature, and knows when to pity\n",
      "a man who can bear no more. He gave his certificate of heart disease and\n",
      "asked no questions of me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, lifting his head from his hands, he said, \"Open the letter, Alec;\n",
      "it is for us both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I tore it open. It was Boris' will dated a year before. He left\n",
      "everything to Geneviève, and in case of her dying childless, I was to\n",
      "take control of the house in the Rue Sainte-Cécile, and Jack Scott the\n",
      "management at Ept. On our deaths the property reverted to his mother's\n",
      "family in Russia, with the exception of the sculptured marbles executed\n",
      "by himself. These he left to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The page blurred under our eyes, and Jack got up and walked to the\n",
      "window. Presently he returned and sat down again. I dreaded to hear what\n",
      "he was going to say, but he spoke with the same simplicity and\n",
      "gentleness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Geneviève lies before the Madonna in the marble room. The Madonna bends\n",
      "tenderly above her, and Geneviève smiles back into that calm face that\n",
      "never would have been except for her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice broke, but he grasped my hand, saying, \"Courage, Alec.\" Next\n",
      "morning he left for Ept to fulfil his trust.\n",

      "IV\n",
      "\n",
      "The same evening I took the keys and went into the house I had known so\n",
      "well. Everything was in order, but the silence was terrible. Though I\n",
      "went twice to the door of the marble room, I could not force myself to\n",
      "enter. It was beyond my strength. I went into the smoking-room and sat\n",
      "down before the spinet. A small lace handkerchief lay on the keys, and I\n",
      "turned away, choking. It was plain I could not stay, so I locked every\n",
      "door, every window, and the three front and back gates, and went away.\n",
      "Next morning Alcide packed my valise, and leaving him in charge of my\n",
      "apartments I took the Orient express for Constantinople. During the two\n",
      "years that I wandered through the East, at first, in our letters, we\n",
      "never mentioned Geneviève and Boris, but gradually their names crept in.\n",
      "I recollect particularly a passage in one of Jack's letters replying to\n",
      "one of mine--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What you tell me of seeing Boris bending over you while you lay ill, and\n",
      "feeling his touch on your face, and hearing his voice, of course troubles\n",
      "me. This that you describe must have happened a fortnight after he died.\n",
      "I say to myself that you were dreaming, that it was part of your\n",
      "delirium, but the explanation does not satisfy me, nor would it you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Toward the end of the second year a letter came from Jack to me in India\n",
      "so unlike anything that I had ever known of him that I decided to return\n",
      "at once to Paris. He wrote: \"I am well, and sell all my pictures as\n",
      "artists do who have no need of money. I have not a care of my own, but I\n",
      "am more restless than if I had. I am unable to shake off a strange\n",
      "anxiety about you. It is not apprehension, it is rather a breathless\n",
      "expectancy--of what, God knows! I can only say it is wearing me out.\n",
      "Nights I dream always of you and Boris. I can never recall anything\n",
      "afterward, but I wake in the morning with my heart beating, and all day\n",
      "the excitement increases until I fall asleep at night to recall the same\n",
      "experience. I am quite exhausted by it, and have determined to break up\n",
      "this morbid condition. I must see you. Shall I go to Bombay, or will you\n",
      "come to Paris?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I telegraphed him to expect me by the next steamer.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we met I thought he had changed very little; I, he insisted, looked\n",
      "in splendid health. It was good to hear his voice again, and as we sat\n",
      "and chatted about what life still held for us, we felt that it was\n",
      "pleasant to be alive in the bright spring weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed in Paris together a week, and then I went for a week to Ept\n",
      "with him, but first of all we went to the cemetery at Sèvres, where Boris\n",
      "lay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall we place the 'Fates' in the little grove above him?\" Jack asked,\n",
      "and I answered--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think only the 'Madonna' should watch over Boris' grave.\" But Jack was\n",
      "none the better for my home-coming. The dreams of which he could not\n",
      "retain even the least definite outline continued, and he said that at\n",
      "times the sense of breathless expectancy was suffocating.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see I do you harm and not good,\" I said. \"Try a change without me.\"\n",
      "So he started alone for a ramble among the Channel Islands, and I went\n",
      "back to Paris. I had not yet entered Boris' house, now mine, since my\n",
      "return, but I knew it must be done. It had been kept in order by Jack;\n",
      "there were servants there, so I gave up my own apartment and went there\n",
      "to live. Instead of the agitation I had feared, I found myself able to\n",
      "paint there tranquilly. I visited all the rooms--all but one. I could not\n",
      "bring myself to enter the marble room where Geneviève lay, and yet I felt\n",
      "the longing growing daily to look upon her face, to kneel beside her.\n",
      "\n",
      "One April afternoon, I lay dreaming in the smoking-room, just as I had\n",
      "lain two years before, and mechanically I looked among the tawny Eastern\n",
      "rugs for the wolf-skin. At last I distinguished the pointed ears and flat\n",
      "cruel head, and I thought of my dream where I saw Geneviève lying beside\n",
      "it. The helmets still hung against the threadbare tapestry, among them\n",
      "the old Spanish morion which I remembered Geneviève had once put on when\n",
      "we were amusing ourselves with the ancient bits of mail. I turned my eyes\n",
      "to the spinet; every yellow key seemed eloquent of her caressing hand,\n",
      "and I rose, drawn by the strength of my life's passion to the sealed door\n",
      "of the marble room. The heavy doors swung inward under my trembling\n",
      "hands. Sunlight poured through the window, tipping with gold the wings of\n",
      "Cupid, and lingered like a nimbus over the brows of the Madonna. Her\n",
      "tender face bent in compassion over a marble form so exquisitely pure\n",
      "that I knelt and signed myself. Geneviève lay in the shadow under the\n",
      "Madonna, and yet, through her white arms, I saw the pale azure vein, and\n",
      "beneath her softly clasped hands the folds of her dress were tinged with\n",
      "rose, as if from some faint warm light within her breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bending, with a breaking heart, I touched the marble drapery with my\n",
      "lips, then crept back into the silent house.\n",
      "\n",
      "A maid came and brought me a letter, and I sat down in the little\n",
      "conservatory to read it; but as I was about to break the seal, seeing the\n",
      "girl lingering, I asked her what she wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stammered something about a white rabbit that had been caught in the\n",
      "house, and asked what should be done with it I told her to let it loose\n",
      "in the walled garden behind the house, and opened my letter. It was from\n",
      "Jack, but so incoherent that I thought he must have lost his reason. It\n",
      "was nothing but a series of prayers to me not to leave the house until he\n",
      "could get back; he could not tell me why, there were the dreams, he\n",
      "said--he could explain nothing, but he was sure that I must not leave the\n",
      "house in the Rue Sainte-Cécile.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I finished reading I raised my eyes and saw the same maid-servant\n",
      "standing in the doorway holding a glass dish in which two gold-fish were\n",
      "swimming: \"Put them back into the tank and tell me what you mean by\n",
      "interrupting me,\" I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a half-suppressed whimper she emptied water and fish into an\n",
      "aquarium at the end of the conservatory, and turning to me asked my\n",
      "permission to leave my service. She said people were playing tricks on\n",
      "her, evidently with a design of getting her into trouble; the marble\n",
      "rabbit had been stolen and a live one had been brought into the house;\n",
      "the two beautiful marble fish were gone, and she had just found those\n",
      "common live things flopping on the dining-room floor. I reassured her and\n",
      "sent her away, saying I would look about myself. I went into the studio;\n",
      "there was nothing there but my canvases and some casts, except the marble\n",
      "of the Easter lily. I saw it on a table across the room. Then I strode\n",
      "angrily over to it. But the flower I lifted from the table was fresh and\n",

      "\n",
      "To-day, however, from the first chord I had felt a change for the worse,\n",
      "a sinister change. During vespers it had been chiefly the chancel organ\n",
      "which supported the beautiful choir, but now and again, quite wantonly as\n",
      "it seemed, from the west gallery where the great organ stands, a heavy\n",
      "hand had struck across the church at the serene peace of those clear\n",
      "voices. It was something more than harsh and dissonant, and it betrayed\n",
      "no lack of skill. As it recurred again and again, it set me thinking of\n",
      "what my architect's books say about the custom in early times to\n",
      "consecrate the choir as soon as it was built, and that the nave, being\n",
      "finished sometimes half a century later, often did not get any blessing\n",
      "at all: I wondered idly if that had been the case at St. Barnabé, and\n",
      "whether something not usually supposed to be at home in a Christian\n",
      "church might have entered undetected and taken possession of the west\n",
      "gallery. I had read of such things happening, too, but not in works on\n",

      "to find in music anything more than melody and harmony, but I felt that\n",
      "in the labyrinth of sounds now issuing from that instrument there was\n",
      "something being hunted. Up and down the pedals chased him, while the\n",

      "My nervous annoyance changed to anger. Who was doing this? How dare he\n",
      "play like that in the midst of divine service? I glanced at the people\n",
      "near me: not one appeared to be in the least disturbed. The placid brows\n",
      "of the kneeling nuns, still turned towards the altar, lost none of their\n",
      "devout abstraction under the pale shadow of their white head-dress. The\n",

      "\n",
      "I was worn out by three nights of physical suffering and mental trouble:\n",
      "the last had been the worst, and it was an exhausted body, and a mind\n",
      "benumbed and yet acutely sensitive, which I had brought to my favourite\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The sun ariseth; they gather themselves together and lay them down in\n",

      "toward the lower end of the church. The organist was coming from behind\n",
      "his pipes, and passing along the gallery on his way out, I saw him\n",
      "disappear by a small door that leads to some stairs which descend\n",
      "directly to the street. He was a slender man, and his face was as white\n",
      "as his coat was black. \"Good riddance!\" I thought, \"with your wicked\n",
      "music! I hope your assistant will play the closing voluntary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a feeling of relief--with a deep, calm feeling of relief, I turned\n",
      "back to the mild face in the pulpit and settled myself to listen. Here,\n",
      "at last, was the ease of mind I longed for.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My children,\" said the preacher, \"one truth the human soul finds hardest\n",

      "that nothing can really harm it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Curious doctrine!\" I thought, \"for a Catholic priest. Let us see how he\n",

      "out from behind the organ, and was passing along the gallery _the same\n",
      "way_. But there had not been time for him to return, and if he had\n",
      "returned, I must have seen him. I felt a faint chill, and my heart sank;\n",
      "and yet, his going and coming were no affair of mine. I looked at him: I\n",
      "could not look away from his black figure and his white face. When he was\n",
      "exactly opposite to me, he turned and sent across the church straight\n",
      "into my eyes, a look of hate, intense and deadly: I have never seen any\n",
      "other like it; would to God I might never see it again! Then he\n",
      "disappeared by the same door through which I had watched him depart less\n",
      "than sixty seconds before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat and tried to collect my thoughts. My first sensation was like that\n",
      "of a very young child badly hurt, when it catches its breath before\n",
      "crying out.\n",
      "\n",
      "To suddenly find myself the object of such hatred was exquisitely\n",
      "painful: and this man was an utter stranger. Why should he hate me\n",
      "so?--me, whom he had never seen before? For the moment all other\n",
      "sensation was merged in this one pang: even fear was subordinate to\n",
      "grief, and for that moment I never doubted; but in the next I began to\n",
      "reason, and a sense of the incongruous came to my aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I have said, St. Barnabé is a modern church. It is small and well\n",
      "lighted; one sees all over it almost at a glance. The organ gallery gets\n",
      "a strong white light from a row of long windows in the clerestory, which\n",
      "have not even coloured glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pulpit being in the middle of the church, it followed that, when I\n",
      "was turned toward it, whatever moved at the west end could not fail to\n",
      "attract my eye. When the organist passed it was no wonder that I saw him:\n",
      "I had simply miscalculated the interval between his first and his second\n",
      "passing. He had come in that last time by the other side-door. As for the\n",
      "look which had so upset me, there had been no such thing, and I was a\n",
      "nervous fool.\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked about. This was a likely place to harbour supernatural horrors!\n",
      "That clear-cut, reasonable face of Monseigneur C----, his collected\n",
      "manner and easy, graceful gestures, were they not just a little\n",
      "discouraging to the notion of a gruesome mystery? I glanced above his\n",
      "head, and almost laughed. That flyaway lady supporting one corner of the\n",
      "pulpit canopy, which looked like a fringed damask table-cloth in a high\n",
      "wind, at the first attempt of a basilisk to pose up there in the organ\n",
      "loft, she would point her gold trumpet at him, and puff him out of\n",
      "existence! I laughed to myself over this conceit, which, at the time, I\n",
      "thought very amusing, and sat and chaffed myself and everything else,\n",
      "from the old harpy outside the railing, who had made me pay ten centimes\n",
      "for my chair, before she would let me in (she was more like a basilisk, I\n",
      "told myself, than was my organist with the anaemic complexion): from that\n",
      "grim old dame, to, yes, alas! Monseigneur C---- himself. For all\n",
      "devoutness had fled. I had never yet done such a thing in my life, but\n",
      "now I felt a desire to mock.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the sermon, I could not hear a word of it for the jingle in my\n",
      "ears of\n",
      "\n",
      " \"The skirts of St. Paul has reached.\n",
      "  Having preached us those six Lent lectures,\n",

      "It was no use to sit there any longer: I must get out of doors and shake\n",
      "myself free from this hateful mood. I knew the rudeness I was committing,\n",
      "but still I rose and left the church.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spring sun was shining on the Rue St. Honoré, as I ran down the church\n",
      "steps. On one corner stood a barrow full of yellow jonquils, pale violets\n",
      "from the Riviera, dark Russian violets, and white Roman hyacinths in a\n",
      "golden cloud of mimosa. The street was full of Sunday pleasure-seekers. I\n",
      "swung my cane and laughed with the rest. Some one overtook and passed me.\n",
      "He never turned, but there was the same deadly malignity in his white\n",
      "profile that there had been in his eyes. I watched him as long as I could\n",
      "see him. His lithe back expressed the same menace; every step that\n",
      "carried him away from me seemed to bear him on some errand connected with\n",
      "my destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was creeping along, my feet almost refusing to move. There began to\n",
      "dawn in me a sense of responsibility for something long forgotten. It\n",
      "began to seem as if I deserved that which he threatened: it reached a\n",
      "long way back--a long, long way back. It had lain dormant all these\n",
      "years: it was there, though, and presently it would rise and confront me.\n",
      "But I would try to escape; and I stumbled as best I could into the Rue de\n",
      "Rivoli, across the Place de la Concorde and on to the Quai. I looked with\n",
      "sick eyes upon the sun, shining through the white foam of the fountain,\n",
      "pouring over the backs of the dusky bronze river-gods, on the far-away\n",
      "Arc, a structure of amethyst mist, on the countless vistas of grey stems\n",
      "and bare branches faintly green. Then I saw him again coming down one of\n",
      "the chestnut alleys of the Cours la Reine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I left the river-side, plunged blindly across to the Champs Elysées and\n",
      "turned toward the Arc. The setting sun was sending its rays along the\n",
      "green sward of the Rond-point: in the full glow he sat on a bench,\n",
      "children and young mothers all about him. He was nothing but a Sunday\n",
      "lounger, like the others, like myself. I said the words almost aloud, and\n",
      "all the while I gazed on the malignant hatred of his face. But he was not\n",
      "looking at me. I crept past and dragged my leaden feet up the Avenue. I\n",
      "knew that every time I met him brought him nearer to the accomplishment\n",
      "of his purpose and my fate. And still I tried to save myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last rays of sunset were pouring through the great Arc. I passed\n",
      "under it, and met him face to face. I had left him far down the Champs\n",
      "Elysées, and yet he came in with a stream of people who were returning\n",
      "from the Bois de Boulogne. He came so close that he brushed me. His\n",
      "slender frame felt like iron inside its loose black covering. He showed\n",
      "no signs of haste, nor of fatigue, nor of any human feeling. His whole\n",
      "being expressed one thing: the will, and the power to work me evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "In anguish I watched him where he went down the broad crowded Avenue,\n",
      "that was all flashing with wheels and the trappings of horses and the\n",
      "helmets of the Garde Republicaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was soon lost to sight; then I turned and fled. Into the Bois, and far\n",
      "out beyond it--I know not where I went, but after a long while as it\n",
      "seemed to me, night had fallen, and I found myself sitting at a table\n",
      "before a small café. I had wandered back into the Bois. It was hours now\n",
      "since I had seen him. Physical fatigue and mental suffering had left me\n",
      "no power to think or feel. I was tired, so tired! I longed to hide away\n",
      "in my own den. I resolved to go home. But that was a long way off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I live in the Court of the Dragon, a narrow passage that leads from the\n",
      "Rue de Rennes to the Rue du Dragon.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is an \"impasse\"; traversable only for foot passengers. Over the\n",
      "entrance on the Rue de Rennes is a balcony, supported by an iron dragon.\n",
      "Within the court tall old houses rise on either side, and close the ends\n",
      "that give on the two streets. Huge gates, swung back during the day into\n",
      "the walls of the deep archways, close this court, after midnight, and one\n",
      "must enter then by ringing at certain small doors on the side. The sunken\n",
      "pavement collects unsavoury pools. Steep stairways pitch down to doors\n",
      "that open on the court. The ground floors are occupied by shops of\n",
      "second-hand dealers, and by iron workers. All day long the place rings\n",
      "with the clink of hammers and the clang of metal bars.\n",
      "\n",

      "When I first came here to live I was young, and not alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had to walk a while before any conveyance appeared, but at last, when I\n",
      "had almost reached the Arc de Triomphe again, an empty cab came along and\n",
      "I took it.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the Arc to the Rue de Rennes is a drive of more than half an hour,\n",
      "especially when one is conveyed by a tired cab horse that has been at the\n",
      "mercy of Sunday fete-makers.\n",
      "\n",
      "There had been time before I passed under the Dragon's wings to meet my\n",
      "enemy over and over again, but I never saw him once, and now refuge was\n",
      "close at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the wide gateway a small mob of children were playing. Our\n",
      "concierge and his wife walked among them, with their black poodle,\n",
      "keeping order; some couples were waltzing on the side-walk. I returned\n",
      "their greetings and hurried in.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the inhabitants of the court had trooped out into the street. The\n",
      "place was quite deserted, lighted by a few lanterns hung high up, in\n",
      "which the gas burned dimly.\n",
      "\n",
      "My apartment was at the top of a house, halfway down the court, reached\n",
      "by a staircase that descended almost into the street, with only a bit of\n",
      "passage-way intervening, I set my foot on the threshold of the open door,\n",
      "the friendly old ruinous stairs rose before me, leading up to rest and\n",
      "shelter. Looking back over my right shoulder, I saw _him,_ ten paces\n",
      "off. He must have entered the court with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was coming straight on, neither slowly, nor swiftly, but straight on\n",
      "to me. And now he was looking at me. For the first time since our eyes\n",
      "encountered across the church they met now again, and I knew that the\n",
      "time had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retreating backward, down the court, I faced him. I meant to escape by\n",
      "the entrance on the Rue du Dragon. His eyes told me that I never should\n",
      "escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed ages while we were going, I retreating, he advancing, down the\n",
      "court in perfect silence; but at last I felt the shadow of the archway,\n",
      "and the next step brought me within it. I had meant to turn here and\n",
      "spring through into the street. But the shadow was not that of an\n",
      "archway; it was that of a vault. The great doors on the Rue du Dragon\n",
      "were closed. I felt this by the blackness which surrounded me, and at the\n",
      "same instant I read it in his face. How his face gleamed in the darkness,\n",
      "drawing swiftly nearer! The deep vaults, the huge closed doors, their\n",
      "cold iron clamps were all on his side. The thing which he had threatened\n",
      "had arrived: it gathered and bore down on me from the fathomless shadows;\n",
      "the point from which it would strike was his infernal eyes. Hopeless, I\n",
      "set my back against the barred doors and defied him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a scraping of chairs on the stone floor, and a rustling as the\n",
      "congregation rose. I could hear the Suisse's staff in the south aisle,\n",
      "preceding Monseigneur C---- to the sacristy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kneeling nuns, roused from their devout abstraction, made their\n",
      "reverence and went away. The fashionable lady, my neighbour, rose also,\n",
      "with graceful reserve. As she departed her glance just flitted over my\n",
      "face in disapproval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Half dead, or so it seemed to me, yet intensely alive to every trifle, I\n",
      "sat among the leisurely moving crowd, then rose too and went toward the\n",
      "door.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had slept through the sermon. Had I slept through the sermon? I looked\n",
      "up and saw him passing along the gallery to his place. Only his side I\n",
      "saw; the thin bent arm in its black covering looked like one of those\n",
      "devilish, nameless instruments which lie in the disused torture-chambers\n",
      "of mediaeval castles.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I had escaped him, though his eyes had said I should not. _Had_\n",
      "I escaped him? That which gave him the power over me came back out of\n",
      "oblivion, where I had hoped to keep it. For I knew him now. Death and the\n",
      "awful abode of lost souls, whither my weakness long ago had sent\n",
      "him--they had changed him for every other eye, but not for mine. I had\n",
      "recognized him almost from the first; I had never doubted what he was\n",
      "come to do; and now I knew while my body sat safe in the cheerful little\n",
      "church, he had been hunting my soul in the Court of the Dragon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I crept to the door: the organ broke out overhead with a blare. A\n",
      "dazzling light filled the church, blotting the altar from my eyes. The\n",
      "people faded away, the arches, the vaulted roof vanished. I raised my\n",
      "seared eyes to the fathomless glare, and I saw the black stars hanging in\n",
      "the heavens: and the wet winds from the lake of Hali chilled my face.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, far away, over leagues of tossing cloud-waves, I saw the moon\n",

      "also is a little ward of God!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first saw the watchman his back was toward me. I looked at him\n",
      "indifferently until he went into the church. I paid no more attention to\n",
      "him than I had to any other man who lounged through Washington Square\n",
      "that morning, and when I shut my window and turned back into my studio I\n",
      "had forgotten him. Late in the afternoon, the day being warm, I raised\n",
      "the window again and leaned out to get a sniff of air. A man was standing\n",
      "in the courtyard of the church, and I noticed him again with as little\n",
      "interest as I had that morning. I looked across the square to where the\n",
      "fountain was playing and then, with my mind filled with vague impressions\n",
      "of trees, asphalt drives, and the moving groups of nursemaids and\n",
      "holiday-makers, I started to walk back to my easel. As I turned, my\n",
      "listless glance included the man below in the churchyard. His face was\n",
      "toward me now, and with a perfectly involuntary movement I bent to see\n",
      "it. At the same moment he raised his head and looked at me. Instantly I\n",
      "thought of a coffin-worm. Whatever it was about the man that repelled me\n",
      "I did not know, but the impression of a plump white grave-worm was so\n",
      "intense and nauseating that I must have shown it in my expression, for he\n",
      "turned his puffy face away with a movement which made me think of a\n",
      "disturbed grub in a chestnut.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went back to my easel and motioned the model to resume her pose. After\n",
      "working a while I was satisfied that I was spoiling what I had done as\n",
      "rapidly as possible, and I took up a palette knife and scraped the colour\n",
      "out again. The flesh tones were sallow and unhealthy, and I did not\n",
      "understand how I could have painted such sickly colour into a study which\n",
      "before that had glowed with healthy tones.\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked at Tessie. She had not changed, and the clear flush of health\n",
      "dyed her neck and cheeks as I frowned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it something I've done?\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,--I've made a mess of this arm, and for the life of me I can't see\n",
      "how I came to paint such mud as that into the canvas,\" I replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't I pose well?\" she insisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, perfectly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it's not my fault?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. It's my own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very sorry,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told her she could rest while I applied rag and turpentine to the\n",
      "plague spot on my canvas, and she went off to smoke a cigarette and look\n",
      "over the illustrations in the _Courrier Français_.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not know whether it was something in the turpentine or a defect in\n",
      "the canvas, but the more I scrubbed the more that gangrene seemed to\n",
      "spread. I worked like a beaver to get it out, and yet the disease\n",
      "appeared to creep from limb to limb of the study before me. Alarmed, I\n",
      "strove to arrest it, but now the colour on the breast changed and the\n",
      "whole figure seemed to absorb the infection as a sponge soaks up water.\n",
      "Vigorously I plied palette-knife, turpentine, and scraper, thinking all\n",
      "the time what a _séance_ I should hold with Duval who had sold me\n",
      "the canvas; but soon I noticed that it was not the canvas which was\n",
      "defective nor yet the colours of Edward. \"It must be the turpentine,\" I\n",
      "thought angrily, \"or else my eyes have become so blurred and confused by\n",
      "the afternoon light that I can't see straight.\" I called Tessie, the\n",
      "model. She came and leaned over my chair blowing rings of smoke into the\n",
      "air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What _have_ you been doing to it?\" she exclaimed\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" I growled, \"it must be this turpentine!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a horrible colour it is now,\" she continued. \"Do you think my flesh\n",
      "resembles green cheese?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't,\" I said angrily; \"did you ever know me to paint like that\n",
      "before?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It must be the turpentine, or something,\" she admitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "She slipped on a Japanese robe and walked to the window. I scraped and\n",
      "rubbed until I was tired, and finally picked up my brushes and hurled\n",
      "them through the canvas with a forcible expression, the tone alone of\n",
      "which reached Tessie's ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless she promptly began: \"That's it! Swear and act silly and ruin\n",
      "your brushes! You have been three weeks on that study, and now look!\n",
      "What's the good of ripping the canvas? What creatures artists are!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt about as much ashamed as I usually did after such an outbreak, and\n",
      "I turned the ruined canvas to the wall. Tessie helped me clean my\n",
      "brushes, and then danced away to dress. From the screen she regaled me\n",
      "with bits of advice concerning whole or partial loss of temper, until,\n",
      "thinking, perhaps, I had been tormented sufficiently, she came out to\n",
      "implore me to button her waist where she could not reach it on the\n",
      "shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everything went wrong from the time you came back from the window and\n",
      "talked about that horrid-looking man you saw in the churchyard,\" she\n",
      "announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he probably bewitched the picture,\" I said, yawning. I looked at my\n",
      "watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's after six, I know,\" said Tessie, adjusting her hat before the\n",
      "mirror.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" I replied, \"I didn't mean to keep you so long.\" I leaned out of\n",
      "the window but recoiled with disgust, for the young man with the pasty\n",
      "face stood below in the churchyard. Tessie saw my gesture of disapproval\n",
      "and leaned from the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that the man you don't like?\" she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "I nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't see his face, but he does look fat and soft. Someway or other,\"\n",
      "she continued, turning to look at me, \"he reminds me of a dream,--an\n",
      "awful dream I once had. Or,\" she mused, looking down at her shapely\n",
      "shoes, \"was it a dream after all?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Tessie leaned back on the open window-sill and began very seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One night last winter I was lying in bed thinking about nothing at all\n",
      "in particular. I had been posing for you and I was tired out, yet it\n",
      "seemed impossible for me to sleep. I heard the bells in the city ring\n",
      "ten, eleven, and midnight. I must have fallen asleep about midnight\n",
      "because I don't remember hearing the bells after that. It seemed to me\n",
      "that I had scarcely closed my eyes when I dreamed that something impelled\n",
      "me to go to the window. I rose, and raising the sash leaned out.\n",
      "Twenty-fifth Street was deserted as far as I could see. I began to be\n",
      "afraid; everything outside seemed so--so black and uncomfortable. Then\n",
      "the sound of wheels in the distance came to my ears, and it seemed to me\n",
      "as though that was what I must wait for. Very slowly the wheels\n",
      "approached, and, finally, I could make out a vehicle moving along the\n",
      "street. It came nearer and nearer, and when it passed beneath my window I\n",
      "saw it was a hearse. Then, as I trembled with fear, the driver turned and\n",
      "looked straight at me. When I awoke I was standing by the open window\n",
      "shivering with cold, but the black-plumed hearse and the driver were\n",
      "gone. I dreamed this dream again in March last, and again awoke beside\n",
      "the open window. Last night the dream came again. You remember how it was\n",
      "raining; when I awoke, standing at the open window, my night-dress was\n",
      "soaked.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But where did I come into the dream?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You--you were in the coffin; but you were not dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the coffin?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you know? Could you see me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; I only knew you were there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Had you been eating Welsh rarebits, or lobster salad?\" I began,\n",
      "laughing, but the girl interrupted me with a frightened cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello! What's up?\" I said, as she shrank into the embrasure by the\n",
      "window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The--the man below in the churchyard;--he drove the hearse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense,\" I said, but Tessie's eyes were wide with terror. I went to\n",
      "the window and looked out. The man was gone. \"Come, Tessie,\" I urged,\n",
      "\"don't be foolish. You have posed too long; you are nervous.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think I could forget that face?\" she murmured. \"Three times I saw\n",
      "the hearse pass below my window, and every time the driver turned and\n",
      "looked up at me. Oh, his face was so white and--and soft? It looked\n",
      "dead--it looked as if it had been dead a long time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I induced the girl to sit down and swallow a glass of Marsala. Then I sat\n",
      "down beside her, and tried to give her some advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look here, Tessie,\" I said, \"you go to the country for a week or two,\n",
      "and you'll have no more dreams about hearses. You pose all day, and when\n",
      "night comes your nerves are upset. You can't keep this up. Then again,\n",
      "instead of going to bed when your day's work is done, you run off to\n",
      "picnics at Sulzer's Park, or go to the Eldorado or Coney Island, and when\n",
      "you come down here next morning you are fagged out. There was no real\n",
      "hearse. There was a soft-shell crab dream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She smiled faintly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What about the man in the churchyard?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, he's only an ordinary unhealthy, everyday creature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As true as my name is Tessie Reardon, I swear to you, Mr. Scott, that\n",
      "the face of the man below in the churchyard is the face of the man who\n",
      "drove the hearse!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What of it?\" I said. \"It's an honest trade.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you think I _did_ see the hearse?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" I said diplomatically, \"if you really did, it might not be unlikely\n",
      "that the man below drove it. There is nothing in that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tessie rose, unrolled her scented handkerchief, and taking a bit of gum\n",
      "from a knot in the hem, placed it in her mouth. Then drawing on her\n",
      "gloves she offered me her hand, with a frank, \"Good-night, Mr. Scott,\"\n",

      "The next morning, Thomas, the bell-boy, brought me the _Herald_ and\n",
      "a bit of news. The church next door had been sold. I thanked Heaven for\n",
      "it, not that being a Catholic I had any repugnance for the congregation\n",
      "next door, but because my nerves were shattered by a blatant exhorter,\n",
      "whose every word echoed through the aisle of the church as if it had been\n",
      "my own rooms, and who insisted on his r's with a nasal persistence which\n",
      "revolted my every instinct. Then, too, there was a fiend in human shape,\n",
      "an organist, who reeled off some of the grand old hymns with an\n",
      "interpretation of his own, and I longed for the blood of a creature who\n",
      "could play the doxology with an amendment of minor chords which one hears\n",
      "only in a quartet of very young undergraduates. I believe the minister\n",
      "was a good man, but when he bellowed: \"And the Lorrrrd said unto Moses,\n",

      "drank our claret from the same bottle and lighted our cigarettes from the\n",
      "same match. I was very much attached to Tessie. I had watched her shoot\n",
      "up into a slender but exquisitely formed woman from a frail, awkward\n",
      "child. She had posed for me during the last three years, and among all my\n",
      "models she was my favourite. It would have troubled me very much indeed\n",
      "had she become \"tough\" or \"fly,\" as the phrase goes, but I never noticed\n",
      "any deterioration of her manner, and felt at heart that she was all\n",
      "right. She and I never discussed morals at all, and I had no intention of\n",
      "doing so, partly because I had none myself, and partly because I knew she\n",
      "would do what she liked in spite of me. Still I did hope she would steer\n",
      "clear of complications, because I wished her well, and then also I had a\n",
      "selfish desire to retain the best model I had. I knew that mashing, as\n",
      "she termed it, had no significance with girls like Tessie, and that such\n",
      "things in America did not resemble in the least the same things in Paris.\n",
      "Yet, having lived with my eyes open, I also knew that somebody would take\n",
      "Tessie away some day, in one manner or another, and though I professed to\n",
      "myself that marriage was nonsense, I sincerely hoped that, in this case,\n",
      "there would be a priest at the end of the vista. I am a Catholic. When I\n",
      "listen to high mass, when I sign myself, I feel that everything,\n",
      "including myself, is more cheerful, and when I confess, it does me good.\n",
      "A man who lives as much alone as I do, must confess to somebody. Then,\n",
      "again, Sylvia was Catholic, and it was reason enough for me. But I was\n",
      "speaking of Tessie, which is very different. Tessie also was Catholic and\n",
      "much more devout than I, so, taking it all in all, I had little fear for\n",
      "my pretty model until she should fall in love. But _then_ I knew\n",
      "that fate alone would decide her future for her, and I prayed inwardly\n",
      "that fate would keep her away from men like me and throw into her path\n",
      "nothing but Ed Burkes and Jimmy McCormicks, bless her sweet face!\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\"Exactly. A dream similar to yours, only much worse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was foolish and thoughtless of me to say this, but you know how little\n",
      "tact the average painter has. \"I must have fallen asleep about ten\n",
      "o'clock,\" I continued, \"and after a while I dreamt that I awoke. So\n",
      "plainly did I hear the midnight bells, the wind in the tree-branches, and\n",
      "the whistle of steamers from the bay, that even now I can scarcely\n",
      "believe I was not awake. I seemed to be lying in a box which had a glass\n",
      "cover. Dimly I saw the street lamps as I passed, for I must tell you,\n",
      "Tessie, the box in which I reclined appeared to lie in a cushioned wagon\n",
      "which jolted me over a stony pavement. After a while I became impatient\n",
      "and tried to move, but the box was too narrow. My hands were crossed on\n",
      "my breast, so I could not raise them to help myself. I listened and then\n",
      "tried to call. My voice was gone. I could hear the trample of the horses\n",
      "attached to the wagon, and even the breathing of the driver. Then another\n",
      "sound broke upon my ears like the raising of a window sash. I managed to\n",
      "turn my head a little, and found I could look, not only through the glass\n",
      "cover of my box, but also through the glass panes in the side of the\n",
      "covered vehicle. I saw houses, empty and silent, with neither light nor\n",
      "life about any of them excepting one. In that house a window was open on\n",
      "the first floor, and a figure all in white stood looking down into the\n",
      "street. It was you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tessie had turned her face away from me and leaned on the table with her\n",
      "elbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could see your face,\" I resumed, \"and it seemed to me to be very\n",
      "sorrowful. Then we passed on and turned into a narrow black lane.\n",
      "Presently the horses stopped. I waited and waited, closing my eyes with\n",
      "ear and impatience, but all was silent as the grave. After what seemed to\n",
      "me hours, I began to feel uncomfortable. A sense that somebody was close\n",
      "to me made me unclose my eyes. Then I saw the white face of the\n",
      "hearse-driver looking at me through the coffin-lid----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A sob from Tessie interrupted me. She was trembling like a leaf. I saw I\n",
      "had made an ass of myself and attempted to repair the damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Tess,\" I said, \"I only told you this to show you what influence\n",
      "your story might have on another person's dreams. You don't suppose I\n",
      "really lay in a coffin, do you? What are you trembling for? Don't you see\n",
      "that your dream and my unreasonable dislike for that inoffensive watchman\n",
      "of the church simply set my brain working as soon as I fell asleep?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She laid her head between her arms, and sobbed as if her heart would\n",
      "break. What a precious triple donkey I had made of myself! But I was\n",
      "about to break my record. I went over and put my arm about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tessie dear, forgive me,\" I said; \"I had no business to frighten you\n",

      "believe in dreams.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her hand tightened on mine and her head fell back upon my shoulder, but\n",
      "she still trembled and I petted her and comforted her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, Tess, open your eyes and smile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her eyes opened with a slow languid movement and met mine, but their\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's all humbug, Tessie; you surely are not afraid that any harm will\n",
      "come to you because of that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" she said, but her scarlet lips quivered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then, what's the matter? Are you afraid?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. Not for myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For me, then?\" I demanded gaily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For you,\" she murmured in a voice almost inaudible. \"I--I care for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At first I started to laugh, but when I understood her, a shock passed\n",
      "through me, and I sat like one turned to stone. This was the crowning bit\n",
      "of idiocy I had committed. During the moment which elapsed between her\n",
      "reply and my answer I thought of a thousand responses to that innocent\n",
      "confession. I could pass it by with a laugh, I could misunderstand her\n",
      "and assure her as to my health, I could simply point out that it was\n",
      "impossible she could love me. But my reply was quicker than my thoughts,\n",
      "and I might think and think now when it was too late, for I had kissed\n",
      "her on the mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening I took my usual walk in Washington Park, pondering over the\n",
      "occurrences of the day. I was thoroughly committed. There was no back out\n",
      "now, and I stared the future straight in the face. I was not good, not\n",
      "even scrupulous, but I had no idea of deceiving either myself or Tessie.\n",
      "The one passion of my life lay buried in the sunlit forests of Brittany.\n",
      "Was it buried for ever? Hope cried \"No!\" For three years I had been\n",
      "listening to the voice of Hope, and for three years I had waited for a\n",
      "footstep on my threshold. Had Sylvia forgotten? \"No!\" cried Hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said that I was no good. That is true, but still I was not exactly a\n",
      "comic opera villain. I had led an easy-going reckless life, taking what\n",
      "invited me of pleasure, deploring and sometimes bitterly regretting\n",
      "consequences. In one thing alone, except my painting, was I serious, and\n",
      "that was something which lay hidden if not lost in the Breton forests.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was too late for me to regret what had occurred during the day.\n",
      "Whatever it had been, pity, a sudden tenderness for sorrow, or the more\n",
      "brutal instinct of gratified vanity, it was all the same now, and unless\n",
      "I wished to bruise an innocent heart, my path lay marked before me. The\n",
      "fire and strength, the depth of passion of a love which I had never even\n",
      "suspected, with all my imagined experience in the world, left me no\n",
      "alternative but to respond or send her away. Whether because I am so\n",
      "cowardly about giving pain to others, or whether it was that I have\n",
      "little of the gloomy Puritan in me, I do not know, but I shrank from\n",
      "disclaiming responsibility for that thoughtless kiss, and in fact had no\n",
      "time to do so before the gates of her heart opened and the flood poured\n",
      "forth. Others who habitually do their duty and find a sullen satisfaction\n",
      "in making themselves and everybody else unhappy, might have withstood it.\n",
      "I did not. I dared not. After the storm had abated I did tell her that\n",
      "she might better have loved Ed Burke and worn a plain gold ring, but she\n",
      "would not hear of it, and I thought perhaps as long as she had decided to\n",
      "love somebody she could not marry, it had better be me. I, at least,\n",
      "could treat her with an intelligent affection, and whenever she became\n",
      "tired of her infatuation she could go none the worse for it. For I was\n",
      "decided on that point although I knew how hard it would be. I remembered\n",
      "the usual termination of Platonic liaisons, and thought how disgusted I\n",
      "had been whenever I heard of one. I knew I was undertaking a great deal\n",
      "for so unscrupulous a man as I was, and I dreamed the future, but never\n",
      "for one moment did I doubt that she was safe with me. Had it been anybody\n",
      "but Tessie I should not have bothered my head about scruples. For it did\n",
      "not occur to me to sacrifice Tessie as I would have sacrificed a woman of\n",
      "the world. I looked the future squarely in the face and saw the several\n",
      "probable endings to the affair. She would either tire of the whole thing,\n",
      "or become so unhappy that I should have either to marry her or go away.\n",
      "If I married her we would be unhappy. I with a wife unsuited to me, and\n",
      "she with a husband unsuitable for any woman. For my past life could\n",
      "scarcely entitle me to marry. If I went away she might either fall ill,\n",
      "recover, and marry some Eddie Burke, or she might recklessly or\n",
      "deliberately go and do something foolish. On the other hand, if she tired\n",
      "of me, then her whole life would be before her with beautiful vistas of\n",
      "Eddie Burkes and marriage rings and twins and Harlem flats and Heaven\n",
      "knows what. As I strolled along through the trees by the Washington Arch,\n",
      "I decided that she should find a substantial friend in me, anyway, and\n",
      "the future could take care of itself. Then I went into the house and put\n",
      "on my evening dress, for the little faintly-perfumed note on my dresser\n",
      "said, \"Have a cab at the stage door at eleven,\" and the note was signed\n",
      "\"Edith Carmichel, Metropolitan Theatre.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I took supper that night, or rather we took supper, Miss Carmichel and I,\n",
      "at Solari's, and the dawn was just beginning to gild the cross on the\n",
      "Memorial Church as I entered Washington Square after leaving Edith at the\n",
      "Brunswick. There was not a soul in the park as I passed along the trees\n",
      "and took the walk which leads from the Garibaldi statue to the Hamilton\n",
      "Apartment House, but as I passed the churchyard I saw a figure sitting on\n",
      "the stone steps. In spite of myself a chill crept over me at the sight of\n",
      "the white puffy face, and I hastened to pass. Then he said something\n",
      "which might have been addressed to me or might merely have been a mutter\n",
      "to himself, but a sudden furious anger flamed up within me that such a\n",
      "creature should address me. For an instant I felt like wheeling about and\n",
      "smashing my stick over his head, but I walked on, and entering the\n",
      "Hamilton went to my apartment. For some time I tossed about the bed\n",
      "trying to get the sound of his voice out of my ears, but could not. It\n",
      "filled my head, that muttering sound, like thick oily smoke from a\n",
      "fat-rendering vat or an odour of noisome decay. And as I lay and tossed\n",
      "about, the voice in my ears seemed more distinct, and I began to\n",
      "understand the words he had muttered. They came to me slowly as if I had\n",
      "forgotten them, and at last I could make some sense out of the sounds. It\n",
      "was this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you found the Yellow Sign?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you found the Yellow Sign?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you found the Yellow Sign?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was furious. What did he mean by that? Then with a curse upon him and\n",
      "his I rolled over and went to sleep, but when I awoke later I looked pale\n",
      "and haggard, for I had dreamed the dream of the night before, and it\n",
      "troubled me more than I cared to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dressed and went down into my studio. Tessie sat by the window, but as\n",
      "I came in she rose and put both arms around my neck for an innocent kiss.\n",
      "She looked so sweet and dainty that I kissed her again and then sat down\n",
      "before the easel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello! Where's the study I began yesterday?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tessie looked conscious, but did not answer. I began to hunt among the\n",
      "piles of canvases, saying, \"Hurry up, Tess, and get ready; we must take\n",
      "advantage of the morning light.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When at last I gave up the search among the other canvases and turned to\n",
      "look around the room for the missing study I noticed Tessie standing by\n",
      "the screen with her clothes still on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the matter,\" I asked, \"don't you feel well?\"\n",

      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then hurry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you want me to pose as--as I have always posed?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I understood. Here was a new complication. I had lost, of course,\n",
      "the best nude model I had ever seen. I looked at Tessie. Her face was\n",
      "scarlet. Alas! Alas! We had eaten of the tree of knowledge, and Eden and\n",
      "native innocence were dreams of the past--I mean for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose she noticed the disappointment on my face, for she said: \"I\n",
      "will pose if you wish. The study is behind the screen here where I put\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" I said, \"we will begin something new;\" and I went into my wardrobe\n",
      "and picked out a Moorish costume which fairly blazed with tinsel. It was\n",
      "a genuine costume, and Tessie retired to the screen with it enchanted.\n",
      "When she came forth again I was astonished. Her long black hair was bound\n",
      "above her forehead with a circlet of turquoises, and the ends, curled\n",
      "about her glittering girdle. Her feet were encased in the embroidered\n",
      "pointed slippers and the skirt of her costume, curiously wrought with\n",
      "arabesques in silver, fell to her ankles. The deep metallic blue vest\n",
      "embroidered with silver and the short Mauresque jacket spangled and sewn\n",
      "with turquoises became her wonderfully. She came up to me and held up her\n",
      "face smiling. I slipped my hand into my pocket, and drawing out a gold\n",
      "chain with a cross attached, dropped it over her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's yours, Tessie.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mine?\" she faltered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yours. Now go and pose,\" Then with a radiant smile she ran behind the\n",
      "screen and presently reappeared with a little box on which was written my\n",
      "name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had intended to give it to you when I went home to-night,\" she said,\n",
      "\"but I can't wait now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I opened the box. On the pink cotton inside lay a clasp of black onyx, on\n",
      "which was inlaid a curious symbol or letter in gold. It was neither\n",
      "Arabic nor Chinese, nor, as I found afterwards, did it belong to any\n",
      "human script.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all I had to give you for a keepsake,\" she said timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was annoyed, but I told her how much I should prize it, and promised to\n",
      "wear it always. She fastened it on my coat beneath the lapel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How foolish, Tess, to go and buy me such a beautiful thing as this,\" I\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not buy it,\" she laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where did you get it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she told me how she had found it one day while coming from the\n",
      "Aquarium in the Battery, how she had advertised it and watched the\n",
      "papers, but at last gave up all hopes of finding the owner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was last winter,\" she said, \"the very day I had the first horrid\n",
      "dream about the hearse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I remembered my dream of the previous night but said nothing, and\n",
      "presently my charcoal was flying over a new canvas, and Tessie stood\n",
      "motionless on the model-stand.\n",

      "The day following was a disastrous one for me. While moving a framed\n",
      "canvas from one easel to another my foot slipped on the polished floor,\n",
      "and I fell heavily on both wrists. They were so badly sprained that it\n",
      "was useless to attempt to hold a brush, and I was obliged to wander about\n",
      "the studio, glaring at unfinished drawings and sketches, until despair\n",
      "seized me and I sat down to smoke and twiddle my thumbs with rage. The\n",
      "rain blew against the windows and rattled on the roof of the church,\n",
      "driving me into a nervous fit with its interminable patter. Tessie sat\n",
      "sewing by the window, and every now and then raised her head and looked\n",
      "at me with such innocent compassion that I began to feel ashamed of my\n",
      "irritation and looked about for something to occupy me. I had read all\n",
      "the papers and all the books in the library, but for the sake of\n",
      "something to do I went to the bookcases and shoved them open with my\n",
      "elbow. I knew every volume by its colour and examined them all, passing\n",
      "slowly around the library and whistling to keep up my spirits. I was\n",
      "turning to go into the dining-room when my eye fell upon a book bound in\n",
      "serpent skin, standing in a corner of the top shelf of the last bookcase.\n",
      "I did not remember it, and from the floor could not decipher the pale\n",
      "lettering on the back, so I went to the smoking-room and called Tessie.\n",
      "She came in from the studio and climbed up to reach the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_The King in Yellow._\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was dumfounded. Who had placed it there? How came it in my rooms? I had\n",
      "long ago decided that I should never open that book, and nothing on earth\n",
      "could have persuaded me to buy it. Fearful lest curiosity might tempt me\n",
      "to open it, I had never even looked at it in book-stores. If I ever had\n",
      "had any curiosity to read it, the awful tragedy of young Castaigne, whom\n",
      "I knew, prevented me from exploring its wicked pages. I had always\n",
      "refused to listen to any description of it, and indeed, nobody ever\n",
      "ventured to discuss the second part aloud, so I had absolutely no\n",
      "knowledge of what those leaves might reveal. I stared at the poisonous\n",
      "mottled binding as I would at a snake.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't touch it, Tessie,\" I said; \"come down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course my admonition was enough to arouse her curiosity, and before I\n",
      "could prevent it she took the book and, laughing, danced off into the\n",
      "studio with it. I called to her, but she slipped away with a tormenting\n",
      "smile at my helpless hands, and I followed her with some impatience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tessie!\" I cried, entering the library, \"listen, I am serious. Put that\n",
      "book away. I do not wish you to open it!\" The library was empty. I went\n",
      "into both drawing-rooms, then into the bedrooms, laundry, kitchen, and\n",
      "finally returned to the library and began a systematic search. She had\n",
      "hidden herself so well that it was half-an-hour later when I discovered\n",
      "her crouching white and silent by the latticed window in the store-room\n",
      "above. At the first glance I saw she had been punished for her\n",
      "foolishness. _The King in Yellow_ lay at her feet, but the book was\n",
      "open at the second part. I looked at Tessie and saw it was too late. She\n",
      "had opened _The King in Yellow_. Then I took her by the hand and led\n",
      "her into the studio. She seemed dazed, and when I told her to lie down on\n",
      "the sofa she obeyed me without a word. After a while she closed her eyes\n",
      "and her breathing became regular and deep, but I could not determine\n",
      "whether or not she slept. For a long while I sat silently beside her, but\n",
      "she neither stirred nor spoke, and at last I rose, and, entering the\n",
      "unused store-room, took the book in my least injured hand. It seemed\n",
      "heavy as lead, but I carried it into the studio again, and sitting down\n",
      "on the rug beside the sofa, opened it and read it through from beginning\n",
      "to end.\n",
      "\n",
      "When, faint with excess of my emotions, I dropped the volume and leaned\n",
      "wearily back against the sofa, Tessie opened her eyes and looked at\n",
      "me....\n",
      "\n",
      "We had been speaking for some time in a dull monotonous strain before I\n",
      "realized that we were discussing _The King in Yellow_. Oh the sin of\n",
      "writing such words,--words which are clear as crystal, limpid and musical\n",
      "as bubbling springs, words which sparkle and glow like the poisoned\n",
      "diamonds of the Medicis! Oh the wickedness, the hopeless damnation of a\n",
      "soul who could fascinate and paralyze human creatures with such\n",
      "words,--words understood by the ignorant and wise alike, words which are\n",
      "more precious than jewels, more soothing than music, more awful than\n",
      "death!\n",
      "\n",
      "We talked on, unmindful of the gathering shadows, and she was begging me\n",
      "to throw away the clasp of black onyx quaintly inlaid with what we now\n",
      "knew to be the Yellow Sign. I never shall know why I refused, though even\n",
      "at this hour, here in my bedroom as I write this confession, I should be\n",
      "glad to know _what_ it was that prevented me from tearing the Yellow\n",
      "Sign from my breast and casting it into the fire. I am sure I wished to\n",
      "do so, and yet Tessie pleaded with me in vain. Night fell and the hours\n",
      "dragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the\n",

      "billowed along my path. From tufts of heath rabbits scurried away through\n",

      "planted firmly on its limp flank. But what astonished me, was not the\n",
      "mere sight of a falcon sitting upon its prey. I had seen that more than\n",

      "sounded among the heather, and a girl sprang into the covert in front.\n",
      "Without a glance at me she walked up to the falcon, and passing her\n",
      "gloved hand under its breast, raised it from the quarry. Then she deftly\n",
      "slipped a small hood over the bird's head, and holding it out on her\n",
      "gauntlet, stooped and picked up the hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "She passed a cord about the animal's legs and fastened the end of the\n",

      "to me that here was my salvation. But as she moved away I recollected\n",
      "that unless I wanted to sleep on a windy moor that night I had better\n",
      "recover my speech without delay. At my first word she hesitated, and as I\n",
      "stepped before her I thought a look of fear came into her beautiful eyes.\n",
      "But as I humbly explained my unpleasant plight, her face flushed and she\n",
      "looked at me in wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely you did not come from Kerselec!\" she repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sweet voice had no trace of the Breton accent nor of any accent which\n",

      "its glossy back and glanced at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look around,\" she said gently. \"Can you see the end of these moors?\n",
      "Look, north, south, east, west. Can you see anything but moorland and\n",

      "may take centuries.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I stared at her in amazement but decided that I had misunderstood her.\n",
      "Then before I had time to speak she drew a whistle from her belt and\n",
      "sounded it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down and rest,\" she said to me; \"you have come a long distance and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"They will be here directly,\" she said, and taking a seat at one end of\n",
      "the rock invited me to sit down on the other edge. The after-glow was\n",
      "beginning to fade in the sky and a single star twinkled faintly through\n",
      "the rosy haze. A long wavering triangle of water-fowl drifted southward\n",
      "over our heads, and from the swamps around plover were calling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are very beautiful--these moors,\" she said quietly.\n",

      "\"Beautiful, but cruel to strangers,\" I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beautiful and cruel,\" she repeated dreamily, \"beautiful and cruel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Like a woman,\" I said stupidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" she cried with a little catch in her breath, and looked at me. Her\n",
      "dark eyes met mine, and I thought she seemed angry or frightened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Like a woman,\" she repeated under her breath, \"How cruel to say so!\"\n",
      "Then after a pause, as though speaking aloud to herself, \"How cruel for\n",
      "him to say that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what sort of an apology I offered for my inane, though\n",
      "harmless speech, but I know that she seemed so troubled about it that I\n",
      "began to think I had said something very dreadful without knowing it, and\n",
      "remembered with horror the pitfalls and snares which the French language\n",
      "sets for foreigners. While I was trying to imagine what I might have\n",
      "said, a sound of voices came across the moor, and the girl rose to her\n",
      "feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" she said, with a trace of a smile on her pale face, \"I will not\n",

      "stepped up to the falconer, and with a quick turn of her wrist\n",
      "transferred her falcon to the hoop, where it quickly sidled off and\n",
      "nestled among its mates, who shook their hooded heads and ruffled their\n",
      "feathers till the belled jesses tinkled again. The other man stepped\n",
      "forward and bowing respectfully took up the hare and dropped it into the\n",
      "game-sack.\n",

      "she seemed pleased to listen, as we walked over the dewy heather.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I had clean forgotten my fatigue in her presence, and I told her so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you think your gallantry is a little old-fashioned?\" she said; and\n",
      "when I looked confused and humbled, she added quietly, \"Oh, I like it, I\n",

      "pretty things.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "mist. The plovers had ceased their calling; the crickets and all the\n",
      "little creatures of the fields were silent as we passed, yet it seemed to\n",
      "me as if I could hear them beginning again far behind us. Well in\n",
      "advance, the two tall falconers strode across the heather, and the faint\n",
      "jingling of the hawks' bells came to our ears in distant murmuring\n",
      "chimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly a splendid hound dashed out of the mist in front, followed by\n",
      "another and another until half-a-dozen or more were bounding and leaping\n",
      "around the girl beside me. She caressed and quieted them with her gloved\n",
      "hand, speaking to them in quaint terms which I remembered to have seen in\n",
      "old French manuscripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the falcons on the circlet borne by the falconer ahead began to beat\n",
      "their wings and scream, and from somewhere out of sight the notes of a\n",
      "hunting-horn floated across the moor. The hounds sprang away before us\n",
      "and vanished in the twilight, the falcons flapped and squealed upon their\n",
      "perch, and the girl, taking up the song of the horn, began to hum. Clear\n",
      "and mellow her voice sounded in the night air.\n",

      "tumult of the hounds and falcons. A torch glimmered at a gate, a light\n",
      "streamed through an opening door, and we stepped upon a wooden bridge\n",
      "which trembled under our feet and rose creaking and straining behind us\n",
      "as we passed over the moat and into a small stone court, walled on every\n",
      "side. From an open doorway a man came and, bending in salutation,\n",
      "presented a cup to the girl beside me. She took the cup and touched it\n",
      "with her lips, then lowering it turned to me and said in a low voice, \"I\n",

      "\n",
      "At that moment one of the falconers came with another cup, but before\n",
      "handing it to me, presented it to the girl, who tasted it. The falconer\n",
      "made a gesture to receive it, but she hesitated a moment, and then,\n",
      "stepping forward, offered me the cup with her own hands. I felt this to\n",
      "be an act of extraordinary graciousness, but hardly knew what was\n",
      "expected of me, and did not raise it to my lips at once. The girl flushed\n",
      "crimson. I saw that I must act quickly.\n",

      "bore one of her petted hawks. With perfect simplicity she took my hand\n",
      "and led me into the garden in the court, and seating herself before a\n",
      "table invited me very sweetly to sit beside her. Then she asked me in her\n",
      "soft quaint accent how I had passed the night, and whether I was very\n",
      "much inconvenienced by wearing the clothes which old Pelagie had put\n",
      "there for me while I slept. I looked at my own clothes and shoes, drying\n",
      "in the sun by the garden-wall, and hated them. What horrors they were\n",

      "honey-comb, and a flagon of deep red wine. \"You see I have not yet broken\n",

      "those rosy palms--I understood now that from the moment when I looked\n",
      "into her dark eyes there on the moor last night I had loved her. My great\n",
      "and sudden passion held me speechless.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you ill at ease?\" she asked again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, like a man who pronounces his own doom, I answered in a low voice:\n",
      "\"Yes, I am ill at ease for love of you.\" And as she did not stir nor\n",
      "answer, the same power moved my lips in spite of me and I said, \"I, who\n",

      "spoken human speech; but I knew that her soul had answered mine, and I\n",
      "drew myself up feeling youth and joyous love coursing through every vein.\n",
      "She, with a bright colour in her lovely face, seemed as one awakened from\n",
      "a dream, and her eyes sought mine with a questioning glance which made me\n",
      "tremble with delight. We broke our fast, speaking of ourselves. I told\n",
      "her my name and she told me hers, the Demoiselle Jeanne d'Ys.\n",
      "\n",
      "She spoke of her father and mother's death, and how the nineteen of her\n",
      "years had been passed in the little fortified farm alone with her nurse\n",
      "Pelagie, Glemarec René the piqueur, and the four falconers, Raoul,\n",
      "Gaston, Hastur, and the Sieur Piriou Louis, who had served her father.\n",
      "She had never been outside the moorland--never even had seen a human soul\n",
      "before, except the falconers and Pelagie. She did not know how she had\n",
      "heard of Kerselec; perhaps the falconers had spoken of it. She knew the\n",
      "legends of Loup Garou and Jeanne la Flamme from her nurse Pelagie. She\n",
      "embroidered and spun flax. Her hawks and hounds were her only\n",
      "distraction. When she had met me there on the moor she had been so\n",
      "frightened that she almost dropped at the sound of my voice. She had, it\n",
      "was true, seen ships at sea from the cliffs, but as far as the eye could\n",
      "reach the moors over which she galloped were destitute of any sign of\n",
      "human life. There was a legend which old Pelagie told, how anybody once\n",
      "lost in the unexplored moorland might never return, because the moors\n",
      "were enchanted. She did not know whether it was true, she never had\n",
      "thought about it until she met me. She did not know whether the falconers\n",
      "had even been outside, or whether they could go if they would. The books\n",
      "in the house which Pelagie, the nurse, had taught her to read were\n",
      "hundreds of years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this she told me with a sweet seriousness seldom seen in any one but\n",
      "children. My own name she found easy to pronounce, and insisted, because\n",
      "my first name was Philip, I must have French blood in me. She did not\n",
      "seem curious to learn anything about the outside world, and I thought\n",
      "perhaps she considered it had forfeited her interest and respect from the\n",
      "stories of her nurse.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were still sitting at the table, and she was throwing grapes to the\n",
      "small field birds which came fearlessly to our very feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I began to speak in a vague way of going, but she would not hear of it,\n",
      "and before I knew it I had promised to stay a week and hunt with hawk and\n",
      "hound in their company. I also obtained permission to come again from\n",
      "Kerselec and visit her after my return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why,\" she said innocently, \"I do not know what I should do if you never\n",
      "came back;\" and I, knowing that I had no right to awaken her with the\n",
      "sudden shock which the avowal of my own love would bring to her, sat\n",
      "silent, hardly daring to breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will come very often?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very often,\" I said.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Every day.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "She rose and took my hand again with a childlike innocence of possession,\n",
      "and we walked through the garden and fruit trees to a grassy lawn which\n",
      "was bordered by a brook. Over the lawn were scattered fifteen or twenty\n",
      "stumps of trees--partially imbedded in the grass--and upon all of these\n",
      "except two sat falcons. They were attached to the stumps by thongs which\n",
      "were in turn fastened with steel rivets to their legs just above the\n",
      "talons. A little stream of pure spring water flowed in a winding course\n",
      "within easy distance of each perch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The birds set up a clamour when the girl appeared, but she went from one\n",
      "to another, caressing some, taking others for an instant upon her wrist,\n",
      "or stooping to adjust their jesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are they not pretty?\" she said. \"See, here is a falcon-gentil. We call\n",
      "it 'ignoble,' because it takes the quarry in direct chase. This is a blue\n",
      "falcon. In falconry we call it 'noble' because it rises over the quarry,\n",
      "and wheeling, drops upon it from above. This white bird is a gerfalcon\n",
      "from the north. It is also 'noble!' Here is a merlin, and this tiercelet\n",
      "is a falcon-heroner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked her how she had learned the old language of falconry. She did not\n",
      "remember, but thought her father must have taught it to her when she was\n",
      "very young.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she led me away and showed me the young falcons still in the nest.\n",
      "\"They are termed _niais_ in falconry,\" she explained. \"A\n",
      "_branchier_ is the young bird which is just able to leave the nest\n",
      "and hop from branch to branch. A young bird which has not yet moulted is\n",
      "called a _sors_, and a _mué_ is a hawk which has moulted in\n",
      "captivity. When we catch a wild falcon which has changed its plumage we\n",
      "term it a _hagard_. Raoul first taught me to dress a falcon. Shall I\n",
      "teach you how it is done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She seated herself on the bank of the stream among the falcons and I\n",
      "threw myself at her feet to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Demoiselle d'Ys held up one rosy-tipped finger and began very\n",
      "gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"First one must catch the falcon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am caught,\" I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed very prettily and told me my _dressage_ would perhaps be\n",
      "difficult, as I was noble.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am already tamed,\" I replied; \"jessed and belled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed, delighted. \"Oh, my brave falcon; then you will return at my\n",
      "call?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am yours,\" I answered gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat silent for a moment. Then the colour heightened in her cheeks and\n",
      "she held up her finger again, saying, \"Listen; I wish to speak of\n",
      "falconry--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I listen, Countess Jeanne d'Ys.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But again she fell into the reverie, and her eyes seemed fixed on\n",
      "something beyond the summer clouds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Philip,\" she said at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jeanne,\" I whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is all,--that is what I wished,\" she sighed,--\"Philip and Jeanne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She held her hand toward me and I touched it with my lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Win me,\" she said, but this time it was the body and soul which spoke in\n",
      "unison.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while she began again: \"Let us speak of falconry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Begin,\" I replied; \"we have caught the falcon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Jeanne d'Ys took my hand in both of hers and told me how with\n",
      "infinite patience the young falcon was taught to perch upon the wrist,\n",
      "how little by little it became used to the belled jesses and the\n",
      "_chaperon à cornette_.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They must first have a good appetite,\" she said; \"then little by little\n",
      "I reduce their nourishment; which in falconry we call _pât_. When,\n",
      "after many nights passed _au bloc_ as these birds are now, I prevail\n",
      "upon the _hagard_ to stay quietly on the wrist, then the bird is\n",
      "ready to be taught to come for its food. I fix the _pât_ to the end\n",
      "of a thong, or _leurre_, and teach the bird to come to me as soon as\n",
      "I begin to whirl the cord in circles about my head. At first I drop the\n",
      "_pât_ when the falcon comes, and he eats the food on the ground.\n",
      "After a little he will learn to seize the _leurre_ in motion as I\n",
      "whirl it around my head or drag it over the ground. After this it is easy\n",
      "to teach the falcon to strike at game, always remembering to _'faire\n",
      "courtoisie á l'oiseau'_, that is, to allow the bird to taste the\n",
      "quarry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A squeal from one of the falcons interrupted her, and she arose to adjust\n",
      "the _longe_ which had become whipped about the _bloc_, but the\n",
      "bird still flapped its wings and screamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What _is_ the matter?\" she said. \"Philip, can you see?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked around and at first saw nothing to cause the commotion, which\n",
      "was now heightened by the screams and flapping of all the birds. Then my\n",
      "eye fell upon the flat rock beside the stream from which the girl had\n",
      "risen. A grey serpent was moving slowly across the surface of the\n",
      "boulder, and the eyes in its flat triangular head sparkled like jet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A couleuvre,\" she said quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is harmless, is it not?\" I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "She pointed to the black V-shaped figure on the neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is certain death,\" she said; \"it is a viper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We watched the reptile moving slowly over the smooth rock to where the\n",
      "sunlight fell in a broad warm patch.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started forward to examine it, but she clung to my arm crying, \"Don't,\n",
      "Philip, I am afraid.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For you, Philip,--I love you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I took her in my arms and kissed her on the lips, but all I could\n",
      "say was: \"Jeanne, Jeanne, Jeanne.\" And as she lay trembling on my breast,\n",
      "something struck my foot in the grass below, but I did not heed it. Then\n",
      "again something struck my ankle, and a sharp pain shot through me. I\n",
      "looked into the sweet face of Jeanne d'Ys and kissed her, and with all my\n",
      "strength lifted her in my arms and flung her from me. Then bending, I\n",
      "tore the viper from my ankle and set my heel upon its head. I remember\n",
      "feeling weak and numb,--I remember falling to the ground. Through my\n",
      "slowly glazing eyes I saw Jeanne's white face bending close to mine, and\n",
      "when the light in my eyes went out I still felt her arms about my neck,\n",
      "and her soft cheek against my drawn lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When I opened my eyes, I looked around in terror. Jeanne was gone. I saw\n",
      "the stream and the flat rock; I saw the crushed viper in the grass beside\n",
      "me, but the hawks and _blocs_ had disappeared. I sprang to my feet.\n",
      "The garden, the fruit trees, the drawbridge and the walled court were\n",
      "gone. I stared stupidly at a heap of crumbling ruins, ivy-covered and\n",
      "grey, through which great trees had pushed their way. I crept forward,\n",
      "dragging my numbed foot, and as I moved, a falcon sailed from the\n",
      "tree-tops among the ruins, and soaring, mounting in narrowing circles,\n",
      "faded and vanished in the clouds above.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jeanne, Jeanne,\" I cried, but my voice died on my lips, and I fell on my\n",

      "\"Excuse me,\" he continued in lazy soothing tones, harmonizing with her\n",
      "purring, \"if I seem indelicate, but I cannot help musing on this\n",
      "rose-coloured garter, flowered so quaintly and fastened with a silver\n",
      "clasp. For the clasp is silver; I can see the mint mark on the edge, as is\n",
      "prescribed by the law of the French Republic. Now, why is this garter\n",
      "woven of rose silk and delicately embroidered,--why is this silken garter\n",
      "with its silver clasp about your famished throat? Am I indiscreet when I\n",
      "inquire if its owner is your owner? Is she some aged dame living in memory\n",
      "of youthful vanities, fond, doting on you, decorating you with her\n",
      "intimate personal attire? The circumference of the garter would suggest\n",
      "this, for your neck is thin, and the garter fits you. But then again I\n",
      "notice--I notice most things--that the garter is capable of being much\n",
      "enlarged. These small silver-rimmed eyelets, of which I count five, are\n",
      "proof of that. And now I observe that the fifth eyelet is worn out, as\n",

      "come to slip this bit of silk and silver about your neck? Was it the\n",
      "caprice of a moment,--when you, before you had lost your pristine\n",
      "plumpness, marched singing into her bedroom to bid her good-morning? Of\n",
      "course, and she sat up among the pillows, her coiled hair tumbling to her\n",
      "shoulders, as you sprang upon the bed purring: 'Good-day, my lady.' Oh, it\n",
      "is very easy to understand,\" he yawned, resting his head on the back of\n",

      "over his knee.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall I tell you all about her, cat? She is very beautiful--your\n",

      "tones and hues and dyes more splendid than the iris of a splendid rainbow.\n",
      "I could only paint her with closed eyes, for in dreams alone can such\n",
      "colours as I need be found. For her eyes, I must have azure from skies\n",
      "untroubled by a cloud--the skies of dreamland. For her lips, roses from\n",
      "the palaces of slumberland, and for her brow, snow-drifts from mountains\n",
      "which tower in fantastic pinnacles to the moons;--oh, much higher than our\n",

      "doubtful, and her ears flattened in nervous expectation. Presently she\n",
      "rose with a jerk of her tail and started on a noiseless tour of the\n",
      "studio. She sneezed at a pot of turpentine, hastily retreating to the\n",
      "table, which she presently mounted, and having satisfied her curiosity\n",
      "concerning a roll of red modelling wax, returned to the door and sat down\n",
      "with her eyes on the crack over the threshold Then she lifted her voice in\n",

      "When Severn returned he looked grave, but the cat, joyous and\n",

      "her voice mounted to a squeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "He placed a bit of meat, wrapped in brown paper, upon the table, and with\n",

      "served for medicine, and poured it into the saucer on the hearth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cat crouched before it, purring and lapping at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "He cooked his egg and ate it with a slice of bread, watching her busy with\n",
      "the shredded meat, and when he had finished, and had filled and emptied a\n",
      "cup of water from the bucket in the sink, he sat down, taking her into his\n",
      "lap, where she at once curled up and began her toilet. He began to speak\n",
      "again, touching her caressingly at times by way of emphasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cat, I have found out where your mistress lives. It is not very far\n",
      "away;--it is here, under this same leaky roof, but in the north wing which\n",
      "I had supposed was uninhabited. My janitor tells me this. By chance, he is\n",
      "almost sober this evening. The butcher on the rue de Seine, where I bought\n",
      "your meat, knows you, and old Cabane the baker identified you with\n",
      "needless sarcasm. They tell me hard tales of your mistress which I shall\n",
      "not believe. They say she is idle and vain and pleasure-loving; they say\n",
      "she is hare-brained and reckless. The little sculptor on the ground floor,\n",
      "who was buying rolls from old Cabane, spoke to me to-night for the first\n",
      "time, although we have always bowed to each other. He said she was very\n",
      "good and very beautiful. He has only seen her once, and does not know her\n",
      "name. I thanked him;--I don't know why I thanked him so warmly. Cabane\n",
      "said, 'Into this cursed Street of the Four Winds, the four winds blow all\n",
      "things evil.' The sculptor looked confused, but when he went out with his\n",
      "rolls, he said to me, 'I am sure, Monsieur, that she is as good as she is\n",
      "beautiful.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The cat had finished her toilet, and now, springing softly to the floor,\n",
      "went to the door and sniffed. He knelt beside her, and unclasping the\n",
      "garter held it for a moment in his hands. After a while he said: \"There is\n",
      "a name engraved upon the silver clasp beneath the buckle. It is a pretty\n",
      "name, Sylvia Elven. Sylvia is a woman's name, Elven is the name of a town.\n",
      "In Paris, in this quarter, above all, in this Street of the Four Winds,\n",
      "names are worn and put away as the fashions change with the seasons. I\n",
      "know the little town of Elven, for there I met Fate face to face and Fate\n",
      "was unkind. But do you know that in Elven Fate had another name, and that\n",
      "name was Sylvia?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He replaced the garter and stood up looking down at the cat crouched\n",
      "before the closed door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The name of Elven has a charm for me. It tells me of meadows and clear\n",
      "rivers. The name of Sylvia troubles me like perfume from dead flowers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The cat mewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" he said soothingly, \"I will take you back. Your Sylvia is not\n",
      "my Sylvia; the world is wide and Elven is not unknown. Yet in the darkness\n",
      "and filth of poorer Paris, in the sad shadows of this ancient house, these\n",
      "names are very pleasant to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He lifted her in his arms and strode through the silent corridors to the\n",
      "stairs. Down five flights and into the moonlit court, past the little\n",
      "sculptor's den, and then again in at the gate of the north wing and up the\n",
      "worm-eaten stairs he passed, until he came to a closed door. When he had\n",
      "stood knocking for a long time, something moved behind the door; it opened\n",
      "and he went in. The room was dark. As he crossed the threshold, the cat\n",
      "sprang from his arms into the shadows. He listened but heard nothing. The\n",
      "silence was oppressive and he struck a match. At his elbow stood a table\n",
      "and on the table a candle in a gilded candlestick. This he lighted, then\n",
      "looked around. The chamber was vast, the hangings heavy with embroidery.\n",
      "Over the fireplace towered a carved mantel, grey with the ashes of dead\n",
      "fires. In a recess by the deep-set windows stood a bed, from which the\n",
      "bedclothes, soft and fine as lace, trailed to the polished floor. He\n",
      "lifted the candle above his head. A handkerchief lay at his feet. It was\n",
      "faintly perfumed. He turned toward the windows. In front of them was a\n",
      "_canapé_ and over it were flung, pell-mell, a gown of silk, a heap of\n",
      "lace-like garments, white and delicate as spiders' meshes, long, crumpled\n",
      "gloves, and, on the floor beneath, the stockings, the little pointed\n",
      "shoes, and one garter of rosy silk, quaintly flowered and fitted with a\n",
      "silver clasp. Wondering, he stepped forward and drew the heavy curtains\n",

      "\n",
      "The street was almost deserted. A few women muffled in tattered military\n",
      "capes crept along the frozen pavement, and a wretchedly clad gamin hovered\n",
      "over the sewer-hole on the corner of the Boulevard. A rope around his\n",
      "waist held his rags together. From the rope hung a rat, still warm and\n",
      "bleeding.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Two francs for a quarter of a fat one; that's what they give at the St.\n",
      "Germain Market.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A violent fit of coughing interrupted him, but he wiped his face with the\n",
      "palm of his hand and looked cunningly at Trent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Last week you could buy a rat for six francs, but,\" and here he swore\n",
      "vilely, \"the rats have quit the rue de Seine and they kill them now over\n",
      "by the new hospital. I'll let you have this for seven francs; I can sell\n",
      "it for ten in the Isle St. Louis.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You lie,\" said Trent, \"and let me tell you that if you try to swindle\n",
      "anybody in this quarter the people will make short work of you and your\n",
      "rats.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood a moment eyeing the gamin, who pretended to snivel. Then he\n",
      "tossed him a franc, laughing. The child caught it, and thrusting it into\n",
      "his mouth wheeled about to the sewer-hole. For a second he crouched,\n",
      "motionless, alert, his eyes on the bars of the drain, then leaping forward\n",
      "he hurled a stone into the gutter, and Trent left him to finish a fierce\n",
      "grey rat that writhed squealing at the mouth of the sewer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suppose Braith should come to that,\" he thought; \"poor little chap;\" and\n",

      "third house to the left.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Monsieur is at home,\" quavered the old concierge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Home? A garret absolutely bare, save for the iron bedstead in the corner\n",
      "and the iron basin and pitcher on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "West appeared at the door, winking with much mystery, and motioned Trent\n",
      "to enter. Braith, who was painting in bed to keep warm, looked up,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Any news?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Where on earth did you get that?\" he demanded, pointing to a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You see, before the siege, I had a letter of introduction to a '_type_'\n",
      "here, a fat banker, German-American variety. You know the species, I see.\n",
      "Well, of course I forgot to present the letter, but this morning, judging\n",

      "standing in the hallway, which I did not like, so I entered the first room\n",
      "I saw and nearly fainted at the sight of a banquet on a table by the fire.\n",
      "Down comes Buttons, very insolent. No, oh, no, his master, 'is not at\n",

      "\n",

      "eat my part because I'm not hungry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Neither am I,\" began Braith, but Trent, with a smile at the pinched faces\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That chicken will delight her, but I really believe she's in love with\n",

      "\n",

      "to me? I take it d----d ill, Braith! How many times must I go over the same\n",
      "thing and explain to you that because I have money it is my duty to share\n",
      "it, and your duty and the duty of every American to share it with me? You\n",
      "can't get a cent, the city's blockaded, and the American Minister has his\n",

      "you act sensibly?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I--I will, Trent, but it's an obligation that perhaps I can never even in\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "forcing him against the dead wall shook him wickedly.\n",
      "\n",

      "appeared at the corner, glanced curiously at West, who merely nodded\n",
      "toward his door saying, \"Come in; Fallowby's upstairs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you doing with that knife?\" demanded Fallowby, as he and Trent\n",
      "entered the studio.\n",
      "\n",
      "West looked at his wounded hand, which still clutched the knife, but\n",
      "saying, \"Cut myself by accident,\" tossed it into a corner and washed the\n",
      "blood from his fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fallowby, fat and lazy, watched him without comment, but Trent, half\n",
      "divining how things had turned, walked over to Fallowby smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've a bone to pick with you!\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is it? I'm hungry,\" replied Fallowby with affected eagerness, but\n",
      "Trent, frowning, told him to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much did I advance you a week ago?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three hundred and eighty francs,\" replied the other, with a squirm of\n",
      "contrition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fallowby began a series of intricate explanations, which were soon cut\n",
      "short by Trent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know; you blew it in;--you always blow it in. I don't care a rap what\n",
      "you did before the siege: I know you are rich and have a right to dispose\n",
      "of your money as you wish to, and I also know that, generally speaking, it\n",
      "is none of my business. But _now_ it is my business, as I have to supply\n",
      "the funds until you get some more, which you won't until the siege is\n",
      "ended one way or another. I wish to share what I have, but I won't see it\n",
      "thrown out of the window. Oh, yes, of course I know you will reimburse me,\n",
      "but that isn't the question; and, anyway, it's the opinion of your\n",
      "friends, old man, that you will not be worse off for a little abstinence\n",
      "from fleshly pleasures. You are positively a freak in this famine-cursed\n",
      "city of skeletons!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I _am_ rather stout,\" he admitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it true you are out of money?\" demanded Trent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I am,\" sighed the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That roast sucking pig on the rue St. Honoré,--is it there yet?\"\n",
      "continued Trent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wh--at?\" stammered the feeble one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah--I thought so! I caught you in ecstasy before that sucking pig at\n",
      "least a dozen times!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then laughing, he presented Fallowby with a roll of twenty franc pieces\n",
      "saying: \"If these go for luxuries you must live on your own flesh,\" and\n",
      "went over to aid West, who sat beside the wash-basin binding up his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "West suffered him to tie the knot, and then said: \"You remember,\n",
      "yesterday, when I left you and Braith to take the chicken to Colette.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chicken! Good heavens!\" moaned Fallowby.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chicken,\" repeated West, enjoying Fallowby's grief;--\"I--that is, I must\n",
      "explain that things are changed. Colette and I--are to be married--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What--what about the chicken?\" groaned Fallowby.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shut up!\" laughed Trent, and slipping his arm through West's, walked to\n",
      "the stairway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The poor little thing,\" said West, \"just think, not a splinter of\n",
      "firewood for a week and wouldn't tell me because she thought I needed\n",
      "it for my clay figure. Whew! When I heard it I smashed that smirking\n",
      "clay nymph to pieces, and the rest can freeze and be hanged!\" After a\n",
      "moment he added timidly: \"Won't you call on your way down and say _bon\n",
      "soir_? It's No. 17.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Trent, and he went out softly closing the door behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped on the third landing, lighted a match, scanned the numbers over\n",
      "the row of dingy doors, and knocked at No. 17.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"C'est toi Georges?\" The door opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, pardon, Monsieur Jack, I thought it was Monsieur West,\" then blushing\n",
      "furiously, \"Oh, I see you have heard! Oh, thank you so much for your\n",
      "wishes, and I'm sure we love each other very much,--and I'm dying to see\n",
      "Sylvia and tell her and--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what?\" laughed Trent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very happy,\" she sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's pure gold,\" returned Trent, and then gaily: \"I want you and George\n",
      "to come and dine with us to-night. It's a little treat,--you see to-morrow\n",
      "is Sylvia's _fête_. She will be nineteen. I have written to Thorne, and\n",
      "the Guernalecs will come with their cousin Odile. Fallowby has engaged not\n",
      "to bring anybody but himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl accepted shyly, charging him with loads of loving messages to\n",
      "Sylvia, and he said good-night.\n",
      "\n",
      "He started up the street, walking swiftly, for it was bitter cold, and\n",
      "cutting across the rue de la Lune he entered the rue de Seine. The early\n",
      "winter night had fallen, almost without warning, but the sky was clear and\n",
      "myriads of stars glittered in the heavens. The bombardment had become\n",
      "furious--a steady rolling thunder from the Prussian cannon punctuated by\n",
      "the heavy shocks from Mont Valérien.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shells streamed across the sky leaving trails like shooting stars, and\n",
      "now, as he turned to look back, rockets blue and red flared above the\n",
      "horizon from the Fort of Issy, and the Fortress of the North flamed like a\n",
      "bonfire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good news!\" a man shouted over by the Boulevard St. Germain. As if by\n",
      "magic the streets were filled with people,--shivering, chattering people\n",
      "with shrunken eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jacques!\" cried one. \"The Army of the Loire!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eh! _mon vieux_, it has come then at last! I told thee! I told thee!\n",
      "To-morrow--to-night--who knows?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it true? Is it a sortie?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Some one said: \"Oh, God--a sortie--and my son?\" Another cried: \"To the\n",
      "Seine? They say one can see the signals of the Army of the Loire from the\n",
      "Pont Neuf.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a child standing near Trent who kept repeating: \"Mamma, Mamma,\n",
      "then to-morrow we may eat white bread?\" and beside him, an old man\n",
      "swaying, stumbling, his shrivelled hands crushed to his breast, muttering\n",
      "as if insane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could it be true? Who has heard the news? The shoemaker on the rue de\n",
      "Buci had it from a Mobile who had heard a Franctireur repeat it to a\n",
      "captain of the National Guard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Trent followed the throng surging through the rue de Seine to the river.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rocket after rocket clove the sky, and now, from Montmartre, the cannon\n",
      "clanged, and the batteries on Montparnasse joined in with a crash. The\n",
      "bridge was packed with people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trent asked: \"Who has seen the signals of the Army of the Loire?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are waiting for them,\" was the reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked toward the north. Suddenly the huge silhouette of the Arc de\n",
      "Triomphe sprang into black relief against the flash of a cannon. The boom\n",
      "of the gun rolled along the quay and the old bridge vibrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again over by the Point du Jour a flash and heavy explosion shook the\n",
      "bridge, and then the whole eastern bastion of the fortifications blazed\n",
      "and crackled, sending a red flame into the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has any one seen the signals yet?\" he asked again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are waiting,\" was the reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, waiting,\" murmured a man behind him, \"waiting, sick, starved,\n",
      "freezing, but waiting. Is it a sortie? They go gladly. Is it to starve?\n",
      "They starve. They have no time to think of surrender. Are they\n",
      "heroes,--these Parisians? Answer me, Trent!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The American Ambulance surgeon turned about and scanned the parapets of\n",
      "the bridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any news, Doctor,\" asked Trent mechanically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"News?\" said the doctor; \"I don't know any;--I haven't time to know any.\n",
      "What are these people after?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They say that the Army of the Loire has signalled Mont Valérien.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor devils.\" The doctor glanced about him for an instant, and then: \"I'm\n",
      "so harried and worried that I don't know what to do. After the last sortie\n",
      "we had the work of fifty ambulances on our poor little corps. To-morrow\n",
      "there's another sortie, and I wish you fellows could come over to\n",
      "headquarters. We may need volunteers. How is madame?\" he added abruptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" replied Trent, \"but she seems to grow more nervous every day. I\n",
      "ought to be with her now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take care of her,\" said the doctor, then with a sharp look at the people:\n",
      "\"I can't stop now--goodnight!\" and he hurried away muttering, \"Poor\n",
      "devils!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Trent leaned over the parapet and blinked at the black river surging\n",
      "through the arches. Dark objects, carried swiftly on the breast of the\n",
      "current, struck with a grinding tearing noise against the stone piers,\n",
      "spun around for an instant, and hurried away into the darkness. The ice\n",
      "from the Marne.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he stood staring into the water, a hand was laid on his shoulder.\n",
      "\"Hello, Southwark!\" he cried, turning around; \"this is a queer place for\n",
      "you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trent, I have something to tell you. Don't stay here,--don't believe in\n",
      "the Army of the Loire:\" and the _attaché_ of the American Legation slipped\n",
      "his arm through Trent's and drew him toward the Louvre.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it's another lie!\" said Trent bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Worse--we know at the Legation--I can't speak of it. But that's not what\n",
      "I have to say. Something happened this afternoon. The Alsatian Brasserie\n",
      "was visited and an American named Hartman has been arrested. Do you know\n",
      "him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know a German who calls himself an American;--his name is Hartman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, he was arrested about two hours ago. They mean to shoot him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course we at the Legation can't allow them to shoot him off-hand, but\n",
      "the evidence seems conclusive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is he a spy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, the papers seized in his rooms are pretty damning proofs, and\n",
      "besides he was caught, they say, swindling the Public Food Committee. He\n",
      "drew rations for fifty, how, I don't know. He claims to be an American\n",
      "artist here, and we have been obliged to take notice of it at the\n",
      "Legation. It's a nasty affair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To cheat the people at such a time is worse than robbing the poor-box,\"\n",
      "cried Trent angrily. \"Let them shoot him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's an American citizen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, oh yes,\" said the other with bitterness. \"American citizenship is a\n",
      "precious privilege when every goggle-eyed German--\" His anger choked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Southwark shook hands with him warmly. \"It can't be helped, we must own\n",
      "the carrion. I am afraid you may be called upon to identify him as an\n",
      "American artist,\" he said with a ghost of a smile on his deep-lined face;\n",
      "and walked away through the Cours la Reine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trent swore silently for a moment and then drew out his watch. Seven\n",
      "o'clock. \"Sylvia will be anxious,\" he thought, and hurried back to the\n",
      "river. The crowd still huddled shivering on the bridge, a sombre pitiful\n",
      "congregation, peering out into the night for the signals of the Army of\n",
      "the Loire: and their hearts beat time to the pounding of the guns, their\n",
      "eyes lighted with each flash from the bastions, and hope rose with the\n",
      "drifting rockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "A black cloud hung over the fortifications. From horizon to horizon the\n",
      "cannon smoke stretched in wavering bands, now capping the spires and domes\n",
      "with cloud, now blowing in streamers and shreds along the streets, now\n",
      "descending from the housetops, enveloping quays, bridges, and river, in a\n",
      "sulphurous mist. And through the smoke pall the lightning of the cannon\n",
      "played, while from time to time a rift above showed a fathomless black\n",
      "vault set with stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned again into the rue de Seine, that sad abandoned street, with its\n",
      "rows of closed shutters and desolate ranks of unlighted lamps. He was a\n",
      "little nervous and wished once or twice for a revolver, but the slinking\n",
      "forms which passed him in the darkness were too weak with hunger to be\n",
      "dangerous, he thought, and he passed on unmolested to his doorway. But\n",
      "there somebody sprang at his throat. Over and over the icy pavement he\n",
      "rolled with his assailant, tearing at the noose about his neck, and then\n",
      "with a wrench sprang to his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get up,\" he cried to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly and with great deliberation, a small gamin picked himself out of\n",
      "the gutter and surveyed Trent with disgust.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a nice clean trick,\" said Trent; \"a whelp of your age! You'll\n",
      "finish against a dead wall! Give me that cord!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The urchin handed him the noose without a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trent struck a match and looked at his assailant. It was the rat-killer of\n",
      "the day before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"H'm! I thought so,\" he muttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tiens, c'est toi?\" said the gamin tranquilly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impudence, the overpowering audacity of the ragamuffin took Trent's\n",
      "breath away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know, you young strangler,\" he gasped, \"that they shoot thieves of\n",
      "your age?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The child turned a passionless face to Trent. \"Shoot, then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That was too much, and he turned on his heel and entered his hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Groping up the unlighted stairway, he at last reached his own landing and\n",
      "felt about in the darkness for the door. From his studio came the sound of\n",
      "voices, West's hearty laugh and Fallowby's chuckle, and at last he found\n",
      "the knob and, pushing back the door, stood a moment confused by the light.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, Jack!\" cried West, \"you're a pleasant creature, inviting people to\n",
      "dine and letting them wait. Here's Fallowby weeping with hunger--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shut up,\" observed the latter, \"perhaps he's been out to buy a turkey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's been out garroting, look at his noose!\" laughed Guernalec.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So now we know where you get your cash!\" added West; \"vive le coup du\n",
      "Père François!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I didn't mean to be late; I stopped on the bridge a moment to watch the\n",
      "bombardment. Were you anxious, Sylvia?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She smiled and murmured, \"Oh, no!\" but her hand dropped into his and\n",
      "tightened convulsively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To the table!\" shouted Fallowby, and uttered a joyous whoop.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take it easy,\" observed Thorne, with a remnant of manners; \"you are not\n",
      "the host, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marie Guernalec, who had been chattering with Colette, jumped up and took\n",
      "Thorne's arm and Monsieur Guernalec drew Odile's arm through his.\n",

      "\n",
      "with all their might, while Fallowby with very bad grace, hammered on the\n",
      "table, consoling himself a little with the hope that the exercise would\n",
      "increase his appetite. Hercules, the black and tan, fled under the bed,\n",
      "from which retreat he yapped and whined until dragged out by Guernalec and\n",
      "placed in Odile's lap.\n",

      "\n",
      "The beef was eaten in comparative calm, but when it was finished and a\n",
      "portion of it set aside for the old people below, Trent cried: \"Drink to\n",
      "Paris! May she rise from her ruins and crush the invader!\" and the cheers\n",
      "rang out, drowning for a moment the monotonous thunder of the Prussian\n",
      "guns.\n",

      "Pipes and cigarettes were lighted, and Trent listened an instant to the\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\" repeated Trent savagely; \"I'll tell you what it is. I have\n",

      "movement, \"I am crazy!\" he muttered, and lighting a candle, went into the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Are you better, dear Sylvia?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "At last she spoke in a voice, changed and strained,--a voice which he had\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Jack, it has come at last. I have feared it and trembled,--ah! how often\n",

      "die before you should ever know of it! For I love you, Jack, and if you go\n",
      "away I cannot live. I have deceived you;--it happened before I knew you,\n",
      "but since that first day when you found me weeping in the Luxembourg and\n",
      "spoke to me, Jack, I have been faithful to you in every thought and deed.\n",
      "I loved you from the first, and did not dare to tell you this--fearing\n",
      "that you would go away; and since then my love has grown--grown--and oh! I\n",
      "suffered!--but I dared not tell you. And now you know, but you do not know\n",

      "\"Must I go on? Must I tell you--can you not imagine, oh! Jack--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not stir; his eyes seemed dead.\n",

      "Trent rose and struck the candle with his clenched fist, and the room was\n",
      "dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bells of St. Sulpice tolled the hour, and she started up, speaking\n",
      "with feverish haste,--\"I must finish! When you told me you loved\n",
      "me--you--you asked me nothing; but then, even then, it was too late, and\n",
      "_that other life_ which binds me to him, must stand for ever between you\n",
      "and me! For there _is another_ whom he has claimed, and is good to. He\n",
      "must not die,--they cannot shoot him, for that _other's_ sake!\"\n",

      "with him the dreary desolation of the siege without complaint,--this\n",
      "slender blue-eyed girl whom he was so quietly fond of, whom he teased or\n",
      "caressed as the whim suited, who sometimes made him the least bit\n",
      "impatient with her passionate devotion to him,--could this be the same\n",
      "Sylvia who lay weeping there in the darkness?\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he clinched his teeth. \"Let him die! Let him die!\"--but then,--for\n",
      "Sylvia's sake, and,--for that _other's_ sake,--Yes, he would go,--he\n",
      "_must_ go,--his duty was plain before him. But Sylvia,--he could not be\n",
      "what he had been to her, and yet a vague terror seized him, now all was\n",
      "said. Trembling, he struck a light.\n",
      "\n",
      "She lay there, her curly hair tumbled about her face, her small white\n",
      "hands pressed to her breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not leave her, and he could not stay. He never knew before that\n",
      "he loved her. She had been a mere comrade, this girl wife of his. Ah! he\n",
      "loved her now with all his heart and soul, and he knew it, only when it\n",
      "was too late. Too late? Why? Then he thought of that _other_ one, binding\n",
      "her, linking her forever to the creature, who stood in danger of his life.\n",
      "With an oath he sprang to the door, but the door would not open,--or was\n",
      "it that he pressed it back,--locked it,--and flung himself on his knees\n",
      "beside the bed, knowing that he dared not for his life's sake leave what\n",

      "\n",
      "It was four in the morning when he came out of the Prison of the Condemned\n",
      "with the Secretary of the American Legation. A knot of people had gathered\n",
      "around the American Minister's carriage, which stood in front of the\n",
      "prison, the horses stamping and pawing in the icy street, the coachman\n",
      "huddled on the box, wrapped in furs. Southwark helped the Secretary into\n",
      "the carriage, and shook hands with Trent, thanking him for coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How the scoundrel did stare,\" he said; \"your evidence was worse than a\n",
      "kick, but it saved his skin for the moment at least,--and prevented\n",
      "complications.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Secretary sighed. \"We have done our part. Now let them prove him a spy\n",
      "and we wash our hands of him. Jump in, Captain! Come along, Trent!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have a word to say to Captain Southwark, I won't detain him,\" said\n",
      "Trent hastily, and dropping his voice, \"Southwark, help _me_ now. You know\n",
      "the story from the blackguard. You know the--the child is at his rooms.\n",
      "Get it, and take it to my own apartment, and if he is shot, I will provide\n",
      "a home for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand,\" said the Captain gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you do this at once?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At once,\" he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their hands met in a warm clasp, and then Captain Southwark climbed into\n",
      "the carriage, motioning Trent to follow; but he shook his head saying,\n",
      "\"Good-bye!\" and the carriage rolled away.\n",
      "\n",
      "He watched the carriage to the end of the street, then started toward his\n",
      "own quarter, but after a step or two hesitated, stopped, and finally\n",
      "turned away in the opposite direction. Something--perhaps it was the sight\n",
      "of the prisoner he had so recently confronted nauseated him. He felt the\n",
      "need of solitude and quiet to collect his thoughts. The events of the\n",
      "evening had shaken him terribly, but he would walk it off, forget, bury\n",
      "everything, and then go back to Sylvia. He started on swiftly, and for a\n",
      "time the bitter thoughts seemed to fade, but when he paused at last,\n",
      "breathless, under the Arc de Triomphe, the bitterness and the wretchedness\n",
      "of the whole thing--yes, of his whole misspent life came back with a pang.\n",
      "Then the face of the prisoner, stamped with the horrible grimace of fear,\n",
      "grew in the shadows before his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sick at heart he wandered up and down under the great Arc, striving to\n",
      "occupy his mind, peering up at the sculptured cornices to read the names\n",
      "of the heroes and battles which he knew were engraved there, but always\n",
      "the ashen face of Hartman followed him, grinning with terror!--or was it\n",
      "terror?--was it not triumph?--At the thought he leaped like a man who\n",
      "feels a knife at his throat, but after a savage tramp around the square,\n",
      "came back again and sat down to battle with his misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air was cold, but his cheeks were burning with angry shame. Shame?\n",
      "Why? Was it because he had married a girl whom chance had made a mother?\n",
      "_Did_ he love her? Was this miserable bohemian existence, then, his end\n",
      "and aim in life? He turned his eyes upon the secrets of his heart, and\n",
      "read an evil story,--the story of the past, and he covered his face for\n",
      "shame, while, keeping time to the dull pain throbbing in his head, his\n",
      "heart beat out the story for the future. Shame and disgrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roused at last from a lethargy which had begun to numb the bitterness of\n",
      "his thoughts, he raised his head and looked about. A sudden fog had\n",
      "settled in the streets; the arches of the Arc were choked with it. He\n",
      "would go home. A great horror of being alone seized him. _But he was not\n",
      "alone._ The fog was peopled with phantoms. All around him in the mist they\n",
      "moved, drifting through the arches in lengthening lines, and vanished,\n",
      "while from the fog others rose up, swept past and were engulfed. He was\n",
      "not alone, for even at his side they crowded, touched him, swarmed before\n",
      "him, beside him, behind him, pressed him back, seized, and bore him with\n",
      "them through the mist. Down a dim avenue, through lanes and alleys white\n",
      "with fog, they moved, and if they spoke their voices were dull as the\n",
      "vapour which shrouded them. At last in front, a bank of masonry and earth\n",
      "cut by a massive iron barred gate towered up in the fog. Slowly and more\n",
      "slowly they glided, shoulder to shoulder and thigh to thigh. Then all\n",
      "movement ceased. A sudden breeze stirred the fog. It wavered and eddied.\n",
      "Objects became more distinct. A pallor crept above the horizon, touching\n",
      "the edges of the watery clouds, and drew dull sparks from a thousand\n",
      "bayonets. Bayonets--they were everywhere, cleaving the fog or flowing\n",
      "beneath it in rivers of steel. High on the wall of masonry and earth a\n",
      "great gun loomed, and around it figures moved in silhouettes. Below, a\n",
      "broad torrent of bayonets swept through the iron barred gateway, out into\n",
      "the shadowy plain. It became lighter. Faces grew more distinct among the\n",
      "marching masses and he recognized one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You, Philippe!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The figure turned its head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trent cried, \"Is there room for me?\" but the other only waved his arm in a\n",
      "vague adieu and was gone with the rest. Presently the cavalry began to\n",
      "pass, squadron on squadron, crowding out into the darkness; then many\n",
      "cannon, then an ambulance, then again the endless lines of bayonets.\n",
      "Beside him a cuirassier sat on his steaming horse, and in front, among a\n",
      "group of mounted officers he saw a general, with the astrakan collar of\n",
      "his dolman turned up about his bloodless face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some women were weeping near him and one was struggling to force a loaf of\n",
      "black bread into a soldier's haversack. The soldier tried to aid her, but\n",
      "the sack was fastened, and his rifle bothered him, so Trent held it, while\n",
      "the woman unbuttoned the sack and forced in the bread, now all wet with\n",
      "her tears. The rifle was not heavy. Trent found it wonderfully manageable.\n",
      "Was the bayonet sharp? He tried it. Then a sudden longing, a fierce,\n",
      "imperative desire took possession of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Chouette!_\" cried a gamin, clinging to the barred gate, \"_encore toi mon\n",
      "vieux_?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Trent looked up, and the rat-killer laughed in his face. But when the\n",
      "soldier had taken the rifle again, and thanking him, ran hard to catch his\n",
      "battalion, he plunged into the throng about the gateway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you going?\" he cried to a marine who sat in the gutter bandaging his\n",
      "foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a girl--a mere child--caught him by the hand and led him into the\n",
      "café which faced the gate. The room was crowded with soldiers, some, white\n",
      "and silent, sitting on the floor, others groaning on the leather-covered\n",
      "settees. The air was sour and suffocating.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Choose!\" said the girl with a little gesture of pity; \"they can't go!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a heap of clothing on the floor he found a capote and képi.\n",
      "\n",
      "She helped him buckle his knapsack, cartridge-box, and belt, and showed\n",
      "him how to load the chasse-pot rifle, holding it on her knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he thanked her she started to her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are a foreigner!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"American,\" he said, moving toward the door, but the child barred his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am a Bretonne. My father is up there with the cannon of the marine. He\n",
      "will shoot you if you are a spy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They faced each other for a moment. Then sighing, he bent over and kissed\n",
      "the child. \"Pray for France, little one,\" he murmured, and she repeated\n",
      "with a pale smile: \"For France and you, beau Monsieur.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He ran across the street and through the gateway. Once outside, he edged\n",
      "into line and shouldered his way along the road. A corporal passed, looked\n",
      "at him, repassed, and finally called an officer. \"You belong to the 60th,\"\n",
      "growled the corporal looking at the number on his képi.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have no use for Franc-tireurs,\" added the officer, catching sight of\n",
      "his black trousers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish to volunteer in place of a comrade,\" said Trent, and the officer\n",
      "shrugged his shoulders and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody paid much attention to him, one or two merely glancing at his\n",
      "trousers. The road was deep with slush and mud-ploughed and torn by wheels\n",
      "and hoofs. A soldier in front of him wrenched his foot in an icy rut and\n",
      "dragged himself to the edge of the embankment groaning. The plain on\n",
      "either side of them was grey with melting snow. Here and there behind\n",
      "dismantled hedge-rows stood wagons, bearing white flags with red crosses.\n",
      "Sometimes the driver was a priest in rusty hat and gown, sometimes a\n",
      "crippled Mobile. Once they passed a wagon driven by a Sister of Charity.\n",
      "Silent empty houses with great rents in their walls, and every window\n",
      "blank, huddled along the road. Further on, within the zone of danger,\n",
      "nothing of human habitation remained except here and there a pile of\n",
      "frozen bricks or a blackened cellar choked with snow.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some time Trent had been annoyed by the man behind him, who kept\n",
      "treading on his heels. Convinced at last that it was intentional, he\n",
      "turned to remonstrate and found himself face to face with a fellow-student\n",
      "from the Beaux Arts. Trent stared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you were in the hospital!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The other shook his head, pointing to his bandaged jaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see, you can't speak. Can I do anything?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The wounded man rummaged in his haversack and produced a crust of black\n",
      "bread.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He can't eat it, his jaw is smashed, and he wants you to chew it for\n",
      "him,\" said the soldier next to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trent took the crust, and grinding it in his teeth morsel by morsel,\n",
      "passed it back to the starving man.\n",
      "\n",
      "From time to time mounted orderlies sped to the front, covering them with\n",
      "slush. It was a chilly, silent march through sodden meadows wreathed in\n",
      "fog. Along the railroad embankment across the ditch, another column moved\n",
      "parallel to their own. Trent watched it, a sombre mass, now distinct, now\n",
      "vague, now blotted out in a puff of fog. Once for half-an-hour he lost it,\n",
      "but when again it came into view, he noticed a thin line detach itself\n",
      "from the flank, and, bellying in the middle, swing rapidly to the west. At\n",
      "the same moment a prolonged crackling broke out in the fog in front. Other\n",
      "lines began to slough off from the column, swinging east and west, and the\n",
      "crackling became continuous. A battery passed at full gallop, and he drew\n",
      "back with his comrades to give it way. It went into action a little to the\n",
      "right of his battalion, and as the shot from the first rifled piece boomed\n",
      "through the mist, the cannon from the fortifications opened with a mighty\n",
      "roar. An officer galloped by shouting something which Trent did not catch,\n",
      "but he saw the ranks in front suddenly part company with his own, and\n",
      "disappear in the twilight. More officers rode up and stood beside him\n",
      "peering into the fog. Away in front the crackling had become one prolonged\n",
      "crash. It was dreary waiting. Trent chewed some bread for the man behind,\n",
      "who tried to swallow it, and after a while shook his head, motioning Trent\n",
      "to eat the rest himself. A corporal offered him a little brandy and he\n",
      "drank it, but when he turned around to return the flask, the corporal was\n",
      "lying on the ground. Alarmed, he looked at the soldier next to him, who\n",
      "shrugged his shoulders and opened his mouth to speak, but something struck\n",
      "him and he rolled over and over into the ditch below. At that moment the\n",
      "horse of one of the officers gave a bound and backed into the battalion,\n",
      "lashing out with his heels. One man was ridden down; another was kicked in\n",
      "the chest and hurled through the ranks. The officer sank his spurs into\n",
      "the horse and forced him to the front again, where he stood trembling. The\n",
      "cannonade seemed to draw nearer. A staff-officer, riding slowly up and\n",
      "down the battalion suddenly collapsed in his saddle and clung to his\n",
      "horse's mane. One of his boots dangled, crimsoned and dripping, from the\n",
      "stirrup. Then out of the mist in front men came running. The roads, the\n",
      "fields, the ditches were full of them, and many of them fell. For an\n",
      "instant he imagined he saw horsemen riding about like ghosts in the\n",
      "vapours beyond, and a man behind him cursed horribly, declaring he too had\n",
      "seen them, and that they were Uhlans; but the battalion stood inactive,\n",
      "and the mist fell again over the meadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The colonel sat heavily upon his horse, his bullet-shaped head buried in\n",
      "the astrakan collar of his dolman, his fat legs sticking straight out in\n",
      "the stirrups.\n",
      "\n",
      "The buglers clustered about him with bugles poised, and behind him a\n",
      "staff-officer in a pale blue jacket smoked a cigarette and chatted with a\n",
      "captain of hussars. From the road in front came the sound of furious\n",
      "galloping and an orderly reined up beside the colonel, who motioned him to\n",
      "the rear without turning his head. Then on the left a confused murmur\n",
      "arose which ended in a shout. A hussar passed like the wind, followed by\n",
      "another and another, and then squadron after squadron whirled by them into\n",
      "the sheeted mists. At that instant the colonel reared in his saddle, the\n",
      "bugles clanged, and the whole battalion scrambled down the embankment,\n",
      "over the ditch and started across the soggy meadow. Almost at once Trent\n",
      "lost his cap. Something snatched it from his head, he thought it was a\n",
      "tree branch. A good many of his comrades rolled over in the slush and ice,\n",
      "and he imagined that they had slipped. One pitched right across his path\n",
      "and he stopped to help him up, but the man screamed when he touched him\n",
      "and an officer shouted, \"Forward! Forward!\" so he ran on again. It was a\n",
      "long jog through the mist, and he was often obliged to shift his rifle.\n",
      "When at last they lay panting behind the railroad embankment, he looked\n",
      "about him. He had felt the need of action, of a desperate physical\n",
      "struggle, of killing and crushing. He had been seized with a desire to\n",
      "fling himself among masses and tear right and left. He longed to fire, to\n",
      "use the thin sharp bayonet on his chassepot. He had not expected this. He\n",
      "wished to become exhausted, to struggle and cut until incapable of lifting\n",
      "his arm. Then he had intended to go home. He heard a man say that half the\n",
      "battalion had gone down in the charge, and he saw another examining a\n",
      "corpse under the embankment. The body, still warm, was clothed in a\n",
      "strange uniform, but even when he noticed the spiked helmet lying a few\n",
      "inches further away, he did not realize what had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The colonel sat on his horse a few feet to the left, his eyes sparkling\n",
      "under the crimson képi. Trent heard him reply to an officer: \"I can hold\n",
      "it, but another charge, and I won't have enough men left to sound a\n",
      "bugle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Were the Prussians here?\" Trent asked of a soldier who sat wiping the\n",
      "blood trickling from his hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. The hussars cleaned them out. We caught their cross fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are supporting a battery on the embankment,\" said another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the battalion crawled over the embankment and moved along the lines\n",
      "of twisted rails. Trent rolled up his trousers and tucked them into his\n",
      "woollen socks: but they halted again, and some of the men sat down on the\n",
      "dismantled railroad track. Trent looked for his wounded comrade from the\n",
      "Beaux Arts. He was standing in his place, very pale. The cannonade had\n",
      "become terrific. For a moment the mist lifted. He caught a glimpse of the\n",
      "first battalion motionless on the railroad track in front, of regiments on\n",
      "either flank, and then, as the fog settled again, the drums beat and the\n",
      "music of the bugles began away on the extreme left. A restless movement\n",
      "passed among the troops, the colonel threw up his arm, the drums rolled,\n",
      "and the battalion moved off through the fog. They were near the front now\n",
      "for the battalion was firing as it advanced. Ambulances galloped along the\n",
      "base of the embankment to the rear, and the hussars passed and repassed\n",
      "like phantoms. They were in the front at last, for all about them was\n",
      "movement and turmoil, while from the fog, close at hand, came cries and\n",
      "groans and crashing volleys. Shells fell everywhere, bursting along the\n",
      "embankment, splashing them with frozen slush. Trent was frightened. He\n",
      "began to dread the unknown, which lay there crackling and flaming in\n",
      "obscurity. The shock of the cannon sickened him. He could even see the fog\n",
      "light up with a dull orange as the thunder shook the earth. It was near,\n",
      "he felt certain, for the colonel shouted \"Forward!\" and the first\n",
      "battalion was hastening into it. He felt its breath, he trembled, but\n",
      "hurried on. A fearful discharge in front terrified him. Somewhere in the\n",
      "fog men were cheering, and the colonel's horse, streaming with blood\n",
      "plunged about in the smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another blast and shock, right in his face, almost stunned him, and he\n",
      "faltered. All the men to the right were down. His head swam; the fog and\n",
      "smoke stupefied him. He put out his hand for a support and caught\n",
      "something. It was the wheel of a gun-carriage, and a man sprang from\n",
      "behind it, aiming a blow at his head with a rammer, but stumbled back\n",
      "shrieking with a bayonet through his neck, and Trent knew that he had\n",
      "killed. Mechanically he stooped to pick up his rifle, but the bayonet was\n",
      "still in the man, who lay, beating with red hands against the sod. It\n",
      "sickened him and he leaned on the cannon. Men were fighting all around him\n",
      "now, and the air was foul with smoke and sweat. Somebody seized him from\n",
      "behind and another in front, but others in turn seized them or struck them\n",
      "solid blows. The click! click! click! of bayonets infuriated him, and he\n",
      "grasped the rammer and struck out blindly until it was shivered to pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man threw his arm around his neck and bore him to the ground, but he\n",
      "throttled him and raised himself on his knees. He saw a comrade seize the\n",
      "cannon, and fall across it with his skull crushed in; he saw the colonel\n",
      "tumble clean out of his saddle into the mud; then consciousness fled.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came to himself, he was lying on the embankment among the twisted\n",
      "rails. On every side huddled men who cried out and cursed and fled away\n",
      "into the fog, and he staggered to his feet and followed them. Once he\n",
      "stopped to help a comrade with a bandaged jaw, who could not speak but\n",
      "clung to his arm for a time and then fell dead in the freezing mire; and\n",
      "again he aided another, who groaned: \"Trent, c'est moi--Philippe,\" until a\n",
      "sudden volley in the midst relieved him of his charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "An icy wind swept down from the heights, cutting the fog into shreds. For\n",
      "an instant, with an evil leer the sun peered through the naked woods of\n",
      "Vincennes, sank like a blood-clot in the battery smoke, lower, lower, into\n",
      "the blood-soaked plain.\n",

      "When midnight sounded from the belfry of St. Sulpice the gates of Paris\n",
      "were still choked with fragments of what had once been an army.\n",
      "\n",
      "They entered with the night, a sullen horde, spattered with slime, faint\n",
      "with hunger and exhaustion. There was little disorder at first, and the\n",
      "throng at the gates parted silently as the troops tramped along the\n",
      "freezing streets. Confusion came as the hours passed. Swiftly and more\n",
      "swiftly, crowding squadron after squadron and battery on battery, horses\n",
      "plunging and caissons jolting, the remnants from the front surged through\n",
      "the gates, a chaos of cavalry and artillery struggling for the right of\n",
      "way. Close upon them stumbled the infantry; here a skeleton of a regiment\n",
      "marching with a desperate attempt at order, there a riotous mob of Mobiles\n",
      "crushing their way to the streets, then a turmoil of horsemen, cannon,\n",
      "troops without, officers, officers without men, then again a line of\n",
      "ambulances, the wheels groaning under their heavy loads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dumb with misery the crowd looked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "All through the day the ambulances had been arriving, and all day long the\n",
      "ragged throng whimpered and shivered by the barriers. At noon the crowd\n",
      "was increased ten-fold, filling the squares about the gates, and swarming\n",
      "over the inner fortifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "At four o'clock in the afternoon the German batteries suddenly wreathed\n",
      "themselves in smoke, and the shells fell fast on Montparnasse. At twenty\n",
      "minutes after four two projectiles struck a house in the rue de Bac, and a\n",
      "moment later the first shell fell in the Latin Quarter.\n",

      "pay us a visit to-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Braith jumped out of bed and bundled himself into a garment which had once\n",
      "been an overcoat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anybody hurt?\" he inquired, struggling with a sleeve full of dilapidated\n",
      "lining.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. Colette is barricaded in the cellar, and the concierge ran away to\n",
      "the fortifications. There will be a rough gang there if the bombardment\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" said Braith; but it was not until they had reached the rue\n",
      "Serpente and had turned in the passage which led to West's cellar, that\n",
      "the latter cried: \"Have you seen Jack Trent, to-day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Braith, looking troubled, \"he was not at Ambulance\n",
      "Headquarters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He stayed to take care of Sylvia, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A bomb came crashing through the roof of a house at the end of the alley\n",
      "and burst in the basement, showering the street with slate and plaster. A\n",
      "second struck a chimney and plunged into the garden, followed by an\n",
      "avalanche of bricks, and another exploded with a deafening report in the\n",
      "next street.\n",
      "\n",
      "They hurried along the passage to the steps which led to the cellar. Here\n",
      "again Braith stopped.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No. Go in and find Colette, and I'll go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, let me go, there's no danger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know it,\" replied West calmly; and, dragging Braith into the alley,\n",
      "pointed to the cellar steps. The iron door was barred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Colette! Colette!\" he called. The door swung inward, and the girl sprang\n",
      "up the stairs to meet them. At that instant, Braith, glancing behind him,\n",
      "gave a startled cry, and pushing the two before him into the cellar,\n",
      "jumped down after them and slammed the iron door. A few seconds later a\n",
      "heavy jar from the outside shook the hinges.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are here,\" muttered West, very pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That door,\" observed Colette calmly, \"will hold for ever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Braith examined the low iron structure, now trembling with the blows\n",
      "rained on it from without. West glanced anxiously at Colette, who\n",
      "displayed no agitation, and this comforted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe they will spend much time here,\" said Braith; \"they only\n",
      "rummage in cellars for spirits, I imagine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unless they hear that valuables are buried there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But surely nothing is buried here?\" exclaimed Braith uneasily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unfortunately there is,\" growled West. \"That miserly landlord of mine--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A crash from the outside, followed by a yell, cut him short; then blow\n",
      "after blow shook the doors, until there came a sharp snap, a clinking of\n",
      "metal and a triangular bit of iron fell inwards, leaving a hole through\n",
      "which struggled a ray of light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly West knelt, and shoving his revolver through the aperture fired\n",
      "every cartridge. For a moment the alley resounded with the racket of the\n",
      "revolver, then absolute silence followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently a single questioning blow fell upon the door, and a moment later\n",
      "another and another, and then a sudden crack zigzagged across the iron\n",
      "plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here,\" said West, seizing Colette by the wrist, \"you follow me, Braith!\"\n",
      "and he ran swiftly toward a circular spot of light at the further end of\n",
      "the cellar. The spot of light came from a barred man-hole above. West\n",
      "motioned Braith to mount on his shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Push it over. You _must_!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With little effort Braith lifted the barred cover, scrambled out on his\n",
      "stomach, and easily raised Colette from West's shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quick, old chap!\" cried the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Braith twisted his legs around a fence-chain and leaned down again. The\n",
      "cellar was flooded with a yellow light, and the air reeked with the stench\n",
      "of petroleum torches. The iron door still held, but a whole plate of metal\n",
      "was gone, and now as they looked a figure came creeping through, holding a\n",
      "torch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quick!\" whispered Braith. \"Jump!\" and West hung dangling until Colette\n",
      "grasped him by the collar, and he was dragged out. Then her nerves gave\n",
      "way and she wept hysterically, but West threw his arm around her and led\n",
      "her across the gardens into the next street, where Braith, after replacing\n",
      "the man-hole cover and piling some stone slabs from the wall over it,\n",
      "rejoined them. It was almost dark. They hurried through the street, now\n",
      "only lighted by burning buildings, or the swift glare of the shells. They\n",
      "gave wide berth to the fires, but at a distance saw the flitting forms of\n",
      "pillagers among the _débris_. Sometimes they passed a female fury crazed\n",
      "with drink shrieking anathemas upon the world, or some slouching lout\n",
      "whose blackened face and hands betrayed his share in the work of\n",
      "destruction. At last they reached the Seine and passed the bridge, and\n",
      "then Braith said: \"I must go back. I am not sure of Jack and Sylvia.\" As\n",
      "he spoke, he made way for a crowd which came trampling across the bridge,\n",
      "and along the river wall by the d'Orsay barracks. In the midst of it West\n",
      "caught the measured tread of a platoon. A lantern passed, a file of\n",
      "bayonets, then another lantern which glimmered on a deathly face behind,\n",
      "and Colette gasped, \"Hartman!\" and he was gone. They peered fearfully\n",
      "across the embankment, holding their breath. There was a shuffle of feet\n",
      "on the quay, and the gate of the barracks slammed. A lantern shone for a\n",
      "moment at the postern, the crowd pressed to the grille, then came the\n",
      "clang of the volley from the stone parade.\n",
      "\n",
      "One by one the petroleum torches flared up along the embankment, and now\n",
      "the whole square was in motion. Down from the Champs Elysées and across\n",
      "the Place de la Concorde straggled the fragments of the battle, a company\n",
      "here, and a mob there. They poured in from every street followed by women\n",
      "and children, and a great murmur, borne on the icy wind, swept through the\n",
      "Arc de Triomphe and down the dark avenue,--\"Perdus! perdus!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A ragged end of a battalion was pressing past, the spectre of\n",
      "annihilation. West groaned. Then a figure sprang from the shadowy ranks\n",
      "and called West's name, and when he saw it was Trent he cried out. Trent\n",
      "seized him, white with terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sylvia?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "West stared speechless, but Colette moaned, \"Oh, Sylvia! Sylvia!--and they\n",
      "are shelling the Quarter!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trent!\" shouted Braith; but he was gone, and they could not overtake\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bombardment ceased as Trent crossed the Boulevard St. Germain, but the\n",
      "entrance to the rue de Seine was blocked by a heap of smoking bricks.\n",
      "Everywhere the shells had torn great holes in the pavement. The café was a\n",
      "wreck of splinters and glass, the book-store tottered, ripped from roof to\n",
      "basement, and the little bakery, long since closed, bulged outward above a\n",
      "mass of slate and tin.\n",
      "\n",
      "He climbed over the steaming bricks and hurried into the rue de Tournon.\n",
      "On the corner a fire blazed, lighting up his own street, and on the bank\n",
      "wall, beneath a shattered gas lamp, a child was writing with a bit of\n",
      "cinder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"HERE FELL THE FIRST SHELL.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The letters stared him in the face. The rat-killer finished and stepped\n",
      "back to view his work, but catching sight of Trent's bayonet, screamed and\n",
      "fled, and as Trent staggered across the shattered street, from holes and\n",
      "crannies in the ruins fierce women fled from their work of pillage,\n",
      "cursing him.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first he could not find his house, for the tears blinded him, but he\n",
      "felt along the wall and reached the door. A lantern burned in the\n",
      "concierge's lodge and the old man lay dead beside it. Faint with fright he\n",
      "leaned a moment on his rifle, then, snatching the lantern, sprang up the\n",
      "stairs. He tried to call, but his tongue hardly moved. On the second floor\n",
      "he saw plaster on the stairway, and on the third the floor was torn and\n",
      "the concierge lay in a pool of blood across the landing. The next floor\n",
      "was his, _theirs_. The door hung from its hinges, the walls gaped. He\n",
      "crept in and sank down by the bed, and there two arms were flung around\n",
      "his neck, and a tear-stained face sought his own.\n",

      "After a moment he repeated, \"Or something worse, which of course I would\n",
      "not notice except for your kindness in warning me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Byram sucked in his lips and looked about him. He was impressed by the\n",
      "evident respectability of the surroundings. Then frowning at the Convent\n",
      "he took Hastings' arm and shuffled across the street to an iron gateway\n",
      "which bore the number 201 _bis_ painted in white on a blue ground. Below\n",
      "this was a notice printed in English:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. For Porter please oppress once.\n",
      "  2. For Servant please oppress twice.\n",
      "  3. For Parlour please oppress thrice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings touched the electric button three times, and they were ushered\n",
      "through the garden and into the parlour by a trim maid. The dining-room\n",
      "door, just beyond, was open, and from the table in plain view a stout\n",
      "woman hastily arose and came toward them. Hastings caught a glimpse of a\n",
      "young man with a big head and several snuffy old gentlemen at breakfast,\n",
      "before the door closed and the stout woman waddled into the room, bringing\n",
      "with her an aroma of coffee and a black poodle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It ees a plaisir to you receive!\" she cried. \"Monsieur is Anglish? No?\n",
      "Americain? Off course. My pension it ees for Americains surtout. Here all\n",
      "spik Angleesh, c'est à dire, ze personnel; ze sairvants do spik, plus ou\n",
      "moins, a little. I am happy to have you comme pensionnaires--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Madame,\" began Dr. Byram, but was cut short again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, yess, I know, ah! mon Dieu! you do not spik Frainch but you have come\n",
      "to lairne! My husband does spik Frainch wiss ze pensionnaires. We have at\n",
      "ze moment a family Americaine who learn of my husband Frainch--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the poodle growled at Dr. Byram and was promptly cuffed by his\n",
      "mistress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Veux tu!\" she cried, with a slap, \"veux tu! Oh! le vilain, oh! le\n",
      "vilain!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mais, madame,\" said Hastings, smiling, \"il n'a pas l'air très féroce.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The poodle fled, and his mistress cried, \"Ah, ze accent charming! He does\n",
      "spik already Frainch like a Parisien young gentleman!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Dr. Byram managed to get in a word or two and gathered more or less\n",
      "information with regard to prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It ees a pension serieux; my clientèle ees of ze best, indeed a pension\n",
      "de famille where one ees at 'ome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they went upstairs to examine Hastings' future quarters, test the\n",
      "bed-springs and arrange for the weekly towel allowance. Dr. Byram appeared\n",
      "satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Marotte accompanied them to the door and rang for the maid, but as\n",
      "Hastings stepped out into the gravel walk, his guide and mentor paused a\n",
      "moment and fixed Madame with his watery eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You understand,\" he said, \"that he is a youth of most careful bringing\n",
      "up, and his character and morals are without a stain. He is young and has\n",
      "never been abroad, never even seen a large city, and his parents have\n",
      "requested me, as an old family friend living in Paris, to see that he is\n",
      "placed under good influences. He is to study art, but on no account would\n",
      "his parents wish him to live in the Latin Quarter if they knew of the\n",
      "immorality which is rife there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A sound like the click of a latch interrupted him and he raised his eyes,\n",
      "but not in time to see the maid slap the big-headed young man behind the\n",
      "parlour-door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame coughed, cast a deadly glance behind her and then beamed on Dr.\n",
      "Byram.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It ees well zat he come here. The pension more serious, il n'en existe\n",
      "pas, eet ees not any!\" she announced with conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, as there was nothing more to add, Dr. Byram joined Hastings at the\n",
      "gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I trust,\" he said, eyeing the Convent, \"that you will make no\n",
      "acquaintances among Jesuits!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings looked at the Convent until a pretty girl passed before the gray\n",
      "façade, and then he looked at her. A young fellow with a paint-box and\n",
      "canvas came swinging along, stopped before the pretty girl, said something\n",
      "during a brief but vigorous handshake at which they both laughed, and he\n",
      "went his way, calling back, \"À demain Valentine!\" as in the same breath\n",
      "she cried, \"À demain!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Valentine,\" thought Hastings, \"what a quaint name;\" and he started to\n",
      "follow the Reverend Joel Byram, who was shuffling towards the nearest\n",
      "tramway station.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "II\n",

      "\"An' you are pleas wiz Paris, Monsieur' Astang?\" demanded Madame Marotte\n",
      "the next morning as Hastings came into the breakfast-room of the pension,\n",
      "rosy from his plunge in the limited bath above.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure I shall like it,\" he replied, wondering at his own depression\n",
      "of spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maid brought him coffee and rolls. He returned the vacant glance of\n",
      "the big-headed young man and acknowledged diffidently the salutes of the\n",
      "snuffy old gentlemen. He did not try to finish his coffee, and sat\n",
      "crumbling a roll, unconscious of the sympathetic glances of Madame\n",
      "Marotte, who had tact enough not to bother him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently a maid entered with a tray on which were balanced two bowls of\n",
      "chocolate, and the snuffy old gentlemen leered at her ankles. The maid\n",
      "deposited the chocolate at a table near the window and smiled at Hastings.\n",
      "Then a thin young lady, followed by her counterpart in all except years,\n",
      "marched into the room and took the table near the window. They were\n",
      "evidently American, but Hastings, if he expected any sign of recognition,\n",
      "was disappointed. To be ignored by compatriots intensified his depression.\n",
      "He fumbled with his knife and looked at his plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thin young lady was talkative enough. She was quite aware of Hastings'\n",
      "presence, ready to be flattered if he looked at her, but on the other hand\n",
      "she felt her superiority, for she had been three weeks in Paris and he, it\n",
      "was easy to see, had not yet unpacked his steamer-trunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her conversation was complacent. She argued with her mother upon the\n",
      "relative merits of the Louvre and the Bon Marché, but her mother's part of\n",
      "the discussion was mostly confined to the observation, \"Why, Susie!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The snuffy old gentlemen had left the room in a body, outwardly polite and\n",
      "inwardly raging. They could not endure the Americans, who filled the room\n",
      "with their chatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The big-headed young man looked after them with a knowing cough,\n",
      "murmuring, \"Gay old birds!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They look like bad old men, Mr. Bladen,\" said the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this Mr. Bladen smiled and said, \"They've had their day,\" in a tone\n",
      "which implied that he was now having his.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And that's why they all have baggy eyes,\" cried the girl. \"I think it's a\n",
      "shame for young gentlemen--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Susie!\" said the mother, and the conversation lagged.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while Mr. Bladen threw down the _Petit Journal_, which he daily\n",
      "studied at the expense of the house, and turning to Hastings, started to\n",
      "make himself agreeable. He began by saying, \"I see you are American.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To this brilliant and original opening, Hastings, deadly homesick, replied\n",
      "gratefully, and the conversation was judiciously nourished by observations\n",
      "from Miss Susie Byng distinctly addressed to Mr. Bladen. In the course of\n",
      "events Miss Susie, forgetting to address herself exclusively to Mr.\n",
      "Bladen, and Hastings replying to her general question, the _entente\n",
      "cordiale_ was established, and Susie and her mother extended a\n",
      "protectorate over what was clearly neutral territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Hastings, you must not desert the pension every evening as Mr. Bladen\n",
      "does. Paris is an awful place for young gentlemen, and Mr. Bladen is a\n",
      "horrid cynic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bladen looked gratified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings answered, \"I shall be at the studio all day, and I imagine I\n",
      "shall be glad enough to come back at night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bladen, who, at a salary of fifteen dollars a week, acted as agent for\n",
      "the Pewly Manufacturing Company of Troy, N.Y., smiled a sceptical smile\n",
      "and withdrew to keep an appointment with a customer on the Boulevard\n",
      "Magenta.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings walked into the garden with Mrs. Byng and Susie, and, at their\n",
      "invitation, sat down in the shade before the iron gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chestnut trees still bore their fragrant spikes of pink and white, and\n",
      "the bees hummed among the roses, trellised on the white-walled house.\n",
      "\n",
      "A faint freshness was in the air. The watering carts moved up and down the\n",
      "street, and a clear stream bubbled over the spotless gutters of the rue de\n",
      "la Grande Chaumière. The sparrows were merry along the curb-stones, taking\n",
      "bath after bath in the water and ruffling their feathers with delight. In\n",
      "a walled garden across the street a pair of blackbirds whistled among the\n",
      "almond trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings swallowed the lump in his throat, for the song of the birds and\n",
      "the ripple of water in a Paris gutter brought back to him the sunny\n",
      "meadows of Millbrook.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a blackbird,\" observed Miss Byng; \"see him there on the bush with\n",
      "pink blossoms. He's all black except his bill, and that looks as if it had\n",
      "been dipped in an omelet, as some Frenchman says--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Susie!\" said Mrs. Byng.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That garden belongs to a studio inhabited by two Americans,\" continued\n",
      "the girl serenely, \"and I often see them pass. They seem to need a great\n",
      "many models, mostly young and feminine--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Susie!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps they prefer painting that kind, but I don't see why they should\n",
      "invite five, with three more young gentlemen, and all get into two cabs\n",
      "and drive away singing. This street,\" she continued, \"is dull. There is\n",
      "nothing to see except the garden and a glimpse of the Boulevard\n",
      "Montparnasse through the rue de la Grande Chaumière. No one ever passes\n",
      "except a policeman. There is a convent on the corner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought it was a Jesuit College,\" began Hastings, but was at once\n",
      "overwhelmed with a Baedecker description of the place, ending with, \"On\n",
      "one side stand the palatial hotels of Jean Paul Laurens and Guillaume\n",
      "Bouguereau, and opposite, in the little Passage Stanislas, Carolus Duran\n",
      "paints the masterpieces which charm the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The blackbird burst into a ripple of golden throaty notes, and from some\n",
      "distant green spot in the city an unknown wild-bird answered with a frenzy\n",
      "of liquid trills until the sparrows paused in their ablutions to look up\n",
      "with restless chirps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a butterfly came and sat on a cluster of heliotrope and waved his\n",
      "crimson-banded wings in the hot sunshine. Hastings knew him for a friend,\n",
      "and before his eyes there came a vision of tall mulleins and scented\n",
      "milkweed alive with painted wings, a vision of a white house and\n",
      "woodbine-covered piazza,--a glimpse of a man reading and a woman leaning\n",
      "over the pansy bed,--and his heart was full. He was startled a moment\n",
      "later by Miss Byng.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe you are homesick!\" Hastings blushed. Miss Byng looked at him\n",
      "with a sympathetic sigh and continued: \"Whenever I felt homesick at first\n",
      "I used to go with mamma and walk in the Luxembourg Gardens. I don't know\n",
      "why it is, but those old-fashioned gardens seemed to bring me nearer home\n",
      "than anything in this artificial city.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But they are full of marble statues,\" said Mrs. Byng mildly; \"I don't see\n",
      "the resemblance myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the Luxembourg?\" inquired Hastings after a silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come with me to the gate,\" said Miss Byng. He rose and followed her, and\n",
      "she pointed out the rue Vavin at the foot of the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You pass by the convent to the right,\" she smiled; and Hastings went.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "III\n",
      "\n",
      "The Luxembourg was a blaze of flowers. He walked slowly through the long\n",
      "avenues of trees, past mossy marbles and old-time columns, and threading\n",
      "the grove by the bronze lion, came upon the tree-crowned terrace above the\n",
      "fountain. Below lay the basin shining in the sunlight. Flowering almonds\n",
      "encircled the terrace, and, in a greater spiral, groves of chestnuts wound\n",
      "in and out and down among the moist thickets by the western palace wing.\n",
      "At one end of the avenue of trees the Observatory rose, its white domes\n",
      "piled up like an eastern mosque; at the other end stood the heavy palace,\n",
      "with every window-pane ablaze in the fierce sun of June.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around the fountain, children and white-capped nurses armed with bamboo\n",
      "poles were pushing toy boats, whose sails hung limp in the sunshine. A\n",
      "dark policeman, wearing red epaulettes and a dress sword, watched them for\n",
      "a while and then went away to remonstrate with a young man who had\n",
      "unchained his dog. The dog was pleasantly occupied in rubbing grass and\n",
      "dirt into his back while his legs waved into the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The policeman pointed at the dog. He was speechless with indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Captain,\" smiled the young fellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Monsieur Student,\" growled the policeman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you come and complain to me for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you don't chain him I'll take him,\" shouted the policeman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's that to me, mon capitaine?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wha--t! Isn't that bull-dog yours?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it was, don't you suppose I'd chain him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The officer glared for a moment in silence, then deciding that as he was a\n",
      "student he was wicked, grabbed at the dog, who promptly dodged. Around and\n",
      "around the flower-beds they raced, and when the officer came too near for\n",
      "comfort, the bull-dog cut across a flower-bed, which perhaps was not\n",
      "playing fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man was amused, and the dog also seemed to enjoy the exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The policeman noticed this and decided to strike at the fountain-head of\n",
      "the evil. He stormed up to the student and said, \"As the owner of this\n",
      "public nuisance I arrest you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" objected the other, \"I disclaim the dog.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That was a poser. It was useless to attempt to catch the dog until three\n",
      "gardeners lent a hand, but then the dog simply ran away and disappeared in\n",
      "the rue de Medici.\n",
      "\n",
      "The policeman shambled off to find consolation among the white-capped\n",
      "nurses, and the student, looking at his watch, stood up yawning. Then\n",
      "catching sight of Hastings, he smiled and bowed. Hastings walked over to\n",
      "the marble, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Clifford,\" he said, \"I didn't recognize you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's my moustache,\" sighed the other. \"I sacrificed it to humour a whim\n",
      "of--of--a friend. What do you think of my dog?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then he is yours?\" cried Hastings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course. It's a pleasant change for him, this playing tag with\n",
      "policemen, but he is known now and I'll have to stop it. He's gone home.\n",
      "He always does when the gardeners take a hand. It's a pity; he's fond of\n",
      "rolling on lawns.\" Then they chatted for a moment of Hastings' prospects,\n",
      "and Clifford politely offered to stand his sponsor at the studio.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see, old tabby, I mean Dr. Byram, told me about you before I met\n",
      "you,\" explained Clifford, \"and Elliott and I will be glad to do anything\n",
      "we can.\" Then looking at his watch again, he muttered, \"I have just ten\n",
      "minutes to catch the Versailles train; au revoir,\" and started to go, but\n",
      "catching sight of a girl advancing by the fountain, took off his hat with\n",
      "a confused smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why are you not at Versailles?\" she said, with an almost imperceptible\n",
      "acknowledgment of Hastings' presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I--I'm going,\" murmured Clifford.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment they faced each other, and then Clifford, very red,\n",
      "stammered, \"With your permission I have the honour of presenting to you my\n",
      "friend, Monsieur Hastings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings bowed low. She smiled very sweetly, but there was something of\n",
      "malice in the quiet inclination of her small Parisienne head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could have wished,\" she said, \"that Monsieur Clifford might spare me\n",
      "more time when he brings with him so charming an American.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Must--must I go, Valentine?\" began Clifford.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clifford took his leave with very bad grace, wincing, when she added, \"And\n",
      "give my dearest love to Cécile!\" As he disappeared in the rue d'Assas, the\n",
      "girl turned as if to go, but then suddenly remembering Hastings, looked at\n",
      "him and shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Monsieur Clifford is so perfectly harebrained,\" she smiled, \"it is\n",
      "embarrassing sometimes. You have heard, of course, all about his success\n",
      "at the Salon?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked puzzled and she noticed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have been to the Salon, of course?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, no,\" he answered, \"I only arrived in Paris three days ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed to pay little heed to his explanation, but continued: \"Nobody\n",
      "imagined he had the energy to do anything good, but on varnishing day the\n",
      "Salon was astonished by the entrance of Monsieur Clifford, who strolled\n",
      "about as bland as you please with an orchid in his buttonhole, and a\n",
      "beautiful picture on the line.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She smiled to herself at the reminiscence, and looked at the fountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Monsieur Bouguereau told me that Monsieur Julian was so astonished that\n",
      "he only shook hands with Monsieur Clifford in a dazed manner, and actually\n",
      "forgot to pat him on the back! Fancy,\" she continued with much merriment,\n",
      "\"fancy papa Julian forgetting to pat one on the back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings, wondering at her acquaintance with the great Bouguereau, looked\n",
      "at her with respect. \"May I ask,\" he said diffidently, \"whether you are a\n",
      "pupil of Bouguereau?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I?\" she said in some surprise. Then she looked at him curiously. Was he\n",
      "permitting himself the liberty of joking on such short acquaintance?\n",
      "\n",
      "His pleasant serious face questioned hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tiens,\" she thought, \"what a droll man!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You surely study art?\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "She leaned back on the crooked stick of her parasol, and looked at him.\n",
      "\"Why do you think so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because you speak as if you did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are making fun of me,\" she said, \"and it is not good taste.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She stopped, confused, as he coloured to the roots of his hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How long have you been in Paris?\" she said at length.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three days,\" he replied gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But--but--surely you are not a nouveau! You speak French too well!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then after a pause, \"Really are you a nouveau?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "at her feet. Hastings had taken a place on the seat, and now, with his\n",
      "elbows on his knees, sat watching the spray drifting above the fountain\n",
      "jet. A small boy, dressed as a sailor, stood poking his yacht and crying,\n",
      "\"I won't go home! I won't go home!\" His nurse raised her hands to Heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just like a little American boy,\" thought Hastings, and a pang of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am American,\" announced the boy in perfectly good English, turning to\n",
      "look at Hastings, \"and she's such a fool she calls me René because mamma\n",
      "calls me Ranny--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here he dodged the exasperated nurse and took up his station behind\n",

      "his lap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One of my countrymen,\" he said to the girl beside him. He smiled while he\n",
      "spoke, but there was a queer feeling in his throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you see the stars and stripes on my yacht?\" demanded Randall. Sure\n",
      "enough, the American colours hung limply under the nurse's arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" cried the girl, \"he is charming,\" and impulsively stooped to kiss\n",
      "him, but the infant Randall wriggled out of Hastings' arms, and his nurse\n",
      "pounced upon him with an angry glance at the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "She reddened and then bit her lips as the nurse, with eyes still fixed on\n",
      "her, dragged the child away and ostentatiously wiped his lips with her\n",

      "\n",
      "Then she stole a look at Hastings and bit her lip again.\n",
      "\n",

      "flattered when people kiss their children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For an instant she tipped the parasol to hide her face, then closed it\n",
      "with a snap and looked at him defiantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think it strange that she objected?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\" he said in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again she looked at him with quick searching eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "His eyes were clear and bright, and he smiled back, repeating, \"Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You _are_ droll,\" she murmured, bending her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But she made no answer, and sat silent, tracing curves and circles in the\n",
      "dust with her parasol. After a while he said--\"I am glad to see that young\n",
      "people have so much liberty here. I understood that the French were not at\n",
      "all like us. You know in America--or at least where I live in Milbrook,\n",
      "girls have every liberty,--go out alone and receive their friends alone,\n",
      "and I was afraid I should miss it here. But I see how it is now, and I am\n",
      "glad I was mistaken.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She raised her eyes to his and kept them there.\n",
      "\n",
      "He continued pleasantly--\"Since I have sat here I have seen a lot of\n",
      "pretty girls walking alone on the terrace there,--and then _you_ are alone\n",
      "too. Tell me, for I do not know French customs,--do you have the liberty\n",
      "of going to the theatre without a chaperone?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time she studied his face, and then with a trembling smile\n",
      "said, \"Why do you ask me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because you must know, of course,\" he said gaily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied indifferently, \"I know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He waited for an answer, but getting none, decided that perhaps she had\n",
      "misunderstood him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope you don't think I mean to presume on our short acquaintance,\" he\n",
      "began,--\"in fact it is very odd but I don't know your name. When Mr.\n",
      "Clifford presented me he only mentioned mine. Is that the custom in\n",
      "France?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is the custom in the Latin Quarter,\" she said with a queer light in\n",
      "her eyes. Then suddenly she began talking almost feverishly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must know, Monsieur Hastings, that we are all _un peu sans gêne_ here\n",
      "in the Latin Quarter. We are very Bohemian, and etiquette and ceremony are\n",
      "out of place. It was for that Monsieur Clifford presented you to me with\n",
      "small ceremony, and left us together with less,--only for that, and I am\n",
      "his friend, and I have many friends in the Latin Quarter, and we all know\n",
      "each other very well--and I am not studying art, but--but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what?\" he said, bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall not tell you,--it is a secret,\" she said with an uncertain smile.\n",
      "On both cheeks a pink spot was burning, and her eyes were very bright.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in a moment her face fell. \"Do you know Monsieur Clifford very\n",
      "intimately?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not very.\"\n",

      "After a while she turned to him, grave and a little pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My name is Valentine--Valentine Tissot. Might--might I ask a service of\n",
      "you on such very short acquaintance?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" he cried, \"I should be honoured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is only this,\" she said gently, \"it is not much. Promise me not to\n",
      "speak to Monsieur Clifford about me. Promise me that you will speak to no\n",
      "one about me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I promise,\" he said, greatly puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed nervously. \"I wish to remain a mystery. It is a caprice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" he began, \"I had wished, I had hoped that you might give Monsieur\n",

      "The change in the girl's face shocked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon,\" he cried, \"I have hurt you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And as quick as a flash she understood him because she was a woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My parents are dead,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently he began again, very gently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would it displease you if I beg you to receive me? It is the custom?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot,\" she answered. Then glancing up at him, \"I am sorry; I should\n",
      "like to; but believe me. I cannot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He bowed seriously and looked vaguely uneasy.\n",
      "\n",

      "me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kind?\" he cried, surprised and puzzled.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"No, not at friends' houses.\"\n",

      "\"Where?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Yes, we are very Bohemian.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it is charming,\" he declared.\n",

      "ranks above the terrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at her, delighted, and she brightened at the success of her\n",

      "and green and appetizing that Heaven help him if he should fall into a\n",
      "salad bowl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hayseed?\" inquired Bowles, plastering in a background with a broken\n",
      "palette-knife and squinting at the effect with approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Squeedunk or Oshkosh, and how he ever grew up among the daisies and\n",

      "\n",
      "Bowles rubbed his thumb across the outlines of his study to \"throw in a\n",
      "little atmosphere,\" as he said, glared at the model, pulled at his pipe\n",
      "and finding it out struck a match on his neighbour's back to relight it.\n",

      "\"His name,\" continued Laffat, hurling a bit of bread at the hat-rack, \"his\n",
      "name is Hastings. He _is_ a berry. He knows no more about the world,\"--and\n",
      "here Mr. Laffat's face spoke volumes for his own knowledge of that\n",
      "planet,--\"than a maiden cat on its first moonlight stroll.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bowles now having succeeded in lighting his pipe, repeated the thumb touch\n",
      "on the other edge of the study and said, \"Ah!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" continued his friend, \"and would you imagine it, he seems to think\n",
      "that everything here goes on as it does in his d----d little backwoods\n",
      "ranch at home; talks about the pretty girls who walk alone in the street;\n",
      "says how sensible it is; and how French parents are misrepresented in\n",
      "America; says that for his part he finds French girls,--and he confessed\n",
      "to only knowing one,--as jolly as American girls. I tried to set him\n",
      "right, tried to give him a pointer as to what sort of ladies walk about\n",
      "alone or with students, and he was either too stupid or too innocent to\n",
      "catch on. Then I gave it to him straight, and he said I was a vile-minded\n",
      "fool and marched off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you assist him with your shoe?\" inquired Bowles, languidly\n",

      "\n",
      "\"_That_,\" replied Clifford.\n",

      "\"Who spoke to you? Is this your business?\" sneered Bowles, but nearly lost\n",
      "his balance as Clifford swung about and eyed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he said slowly, \"it's my business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No one spoke for some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Clifford sang out, \"I say, Hastings!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And when Hastings left his easel and came around, he nodded toward the\n",
      "astonished Laffat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This man has been disagreeable to you, and I want to tell you that any\n",
      "time you feel inclined to kick him, why, I will hold the other creature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings, embarrassed, said, \"Why no, I don't agree with his ideas,\n",
      "nothing more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Clifford said \"Naturally,\" and slipping his arm through Hastings',\n",
      "strolled about with him, and introduced him to several of his own friends,\n",
      "at which all the nouveaux opened their eyes with envy, and the studio were\n",
      "given to understand that Hastings, although prepared to do menial work as\n",

      "respected and feared, the truly great.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest finished, the model resumed his place, and work went on in a\n",

      "\n",
      "Five o'clock struck,--the model yawned, stretched and climbed into his\n",
      "trousers, and the noisy contents of six studios crowded through the hall\n",
      "and down into the street. Ten minutes later, Hastings found himself on top\n",
      "of a Montrouge tram, and shortly afterward was joined by Clifford.\n",
      "\n",
      "They climbed down at the rue Gay Lussac.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I always stop here,\" observed Clifford, \"I like the walk through the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"By the way,\" said Hastings, \"how can I call on you when I don't know\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, I live opposite you.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Hastings thought of the description of the two American artists which he\n",

      "lamely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shouldn't care to meet any of your model friends there,\" said Hastings,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I understand,\" said Clifford, but added with great cordiality,--\"I'm\n",
      "sure we'll be friends although you may not approve of me and my set, but\n",
      "you will like Severn and Selby because--because, well, they are like\n",

      "After a moment he continued, \"There is something I want to speak about.\n",

      "himself is a beautiful example of moral decency in a Quarter where morals\n",
      "are as rare as elephants. I heard enough in a conversation between that\n",
      "blackguard Loffat and the little immoral eruption, Bowles, to open my\n",
      "eyes. I tell you Hastings is a trump! He's a healthy, clean-minded young\n",
      "fellow, bred in a small country village, brought up with the idea that\n",
      "saloons are way-stations to hell--and as for women--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\" demanded Elliott\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Clifford, \"his idea of the dangerous woman is probably a\n",
      "painted Jezabel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Probably,\" replied the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's a trump!\" said Clifford, \"and if he swears the world is as good and\n",
      "pure as his own heart, I'll swear he's right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elliott rubbed his charcoal on his file to get a point and turned to his\n",
      "sketch saying, \"He will never hear any pessimism from Richard Osborne E.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's a lesson to me,\" said Clifford. Then he unfolded a small perfumed\n",
      "note, written on rose-coloured paper, which had been lying on the table\n",
      "before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He read it, smiled, whistled a bar or two from \"Miss Helyett,\" and sat\n",
      "down to answer it on his best cream-laid note-paper. When it was written\n",
      "and sealed, he picked up his stick and marched up and down the studio two\n",
      "or three times, whistling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Going out?\" inquired the other, without turning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he said, but lingered a moment over Elliott's shoulder, watching\n",
      "him pick out the lights in his sketch with a bit of bread.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To-morrow is Sunday,\" he observed after a moment's silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\" inquired Elliott.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you seen Colette?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I will to-night. She and Rowden and Jacqueline are coming to\n",
      "Boulant's. I suppose you and, Cécile will be there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, no,\" replied Clifford. \"Cécile dines at home to-night, and I--I had\n",
      "an idea of going to Mignon's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elliott looked at him with disapproval.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can make all the arrangements for La Roche without me,\" he continued,\n",
      "avoiding Elliott's eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you up to now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" protested Clifford.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't tell me,\" replied his chum, with scorn; \"fellows don't rush off to\n",
      "Mignon's when the set dine at Boulant's. Who is it now?--but no, I won't\n",
      "ask that,--what's the use!\" Then he lifted up his voice in complaint and\n",
      "beat upon the table with his pipe. \"What's the use of ever trying to keep\n",
      "track of you? What will Cécile say,--oh, yes, what will she say? It's a\n",
      "pity you can't be constant two months, yes, by Jove! and the Quarter is\n",
      "indulgent, but you abuse its good nature and mine too!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently he arose, and jamming his hat on his head, marched to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven alone knows why any one puts up with your antics, but they all do\n",
      "and so do I. If I were Cécile or any of the other pretty fools after whom\n",
      "you have toddled and will, in all human probabilities, continue to toddle,\n",
      "I say, if I were Cécile I'd spank you! Now I'm going to Boulant's, and as\n",
      "usual I shall make excuses for you and arrange the affair, and I don't\n",
      "care a continental where you are going, but, by the skull of the studio\n",
      "skeleton! if you don't turn up to-morrow with your sketching-kit under one\n",
      "arm and Cécile under the other,--if you don't turn up in good shape, I'm\n",
      "done with you, and the rest can think what they please. Good-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Clifford said good-night with as pleasant a smile as he could muster, and\n",
      "then sat down with his eyes on the door. He took out his watch and gave\n",
      "Elliott ten minutes to vanish, then rang the concierge's call, murmuring,\n",
      "\"Oh dear, oh dear, why the devil do I do it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alfred,\" he said, as that gimlet-eyed person answered the call, \"make\n",
      "yourself clean and proper, Alfred, and replace your sabots with a pair of\n",
      "shoes. Then put on your best hat and take this letter to the big white\n",
      "house in the Rue de Dragon. There is no answer, _mon petit_ Alfred.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The concierge departed with a snort in which unwillingness for the errand\n",
      "and affection for M. Clifford were blended. Then with great care the young\n",
      "fellow arrayed himself in all the beauties of his and Elliott's wardrobe.\n",
      "He took his time about it, and occasionally interrupted his toilet to play\n",
      "his banjo or make pleasing diversion for the bull-dogs by gambling about\n",
      "on all fours. \"I've got two hours before me,\" he thought, and borrowed a\n",
      "pair of Elliott's silken foot-gear, with which he and the dogs played ball\n",
      "until he decided to put them on. Then he lighted a cigarette and inspected\n",
      "his dress-coat. When he had emptied it of four handkerchiefs, a fan, and a\n",
      "pair of crumpled gloves as long as his arm, he decided it was not suited\n",
      "to add _éclat_ to his charms and cast about in his mind for a substitute.\n",
      "Elliott was too thin, and, anyway, his coats were now under lock and key.\n",
      "Rowden probably was as badly off as himself. Hastings! Hastings was the\n",
      "man! But when he threw on a smoking-jacket and sauntered over to Hastings'\n",
      "house, he was informed that he had been gone over an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, where in the name of all that's reasonable could he have gone!\"\n",
      "muttered Clifford, looking down the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maid didn't know, so he bestowed upon her a fascinating smile and\n",
      "lounged back to the studio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings was not far away. The Luxembourg is within five minutes' walk of\n",
      "the rue Notre Dame des Champs, and there he sat under the shadow of a\n",
      "winged god, and there he had sat for an hour, poking holes in the dust and\n",
      "watching the steps which lead from the northern terrace to the fountain.\n",
      "The sun hung, a purple globe, above the misty hills of Meudon. Long\n",
      "streamers of clouds touched with rose swept low on the western sky, and\n",
      "the dome of the distant Invalides burned like an opal through the haze.\n",
      "Behind the Palace the smoke from a high chimney mounted straight into the\n",
      "air, purple until it crossed the sun, where it changed to a bar of\n",
      "smouldering fire. High above the darkening foliage of the chestnuts the\n",
      "twin towers of St. Sulpice rose, an ever-deepening silhouette.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sleepy blackbird was carolling in some near thicket, and pigeons passed\n",
      "and repassed with the whisper of soft winds in their wings. The light on\n",
      "the Palace windows had died away, and the dome of the Pantheon swam aglow\n",
      "above the northern terrace, a fiery Valhalla in the sky; while below in\n",
      "grim array, along the terrace ranged, the marble ranks of queens looked\n",
      "out into the west.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the end of the long walk by the northern façade of the Palace came\n",
      "the noise of omnibuses and the cries of the street. Hastings looked at the\n",
      "Palace clock. Six, and as his own watch agreed with it, he fell to poking\n",
      "holes in the gravel again. A constant stream of people passed between the\n",
      "Odéon and the fountain. Priests in black, with silver-buckled shoes; line\n",
      "soldiers, slouchy and rakish; neat girls without hats bearing milliners'\n",
      "boxes, students with black portfolios and high hats, students with bérets\n",
      "and big canes, nervous, quick-stepping officers, symphonies in turquoise\n",
      "and silver; ponderous jangling cavalrymen all over dust, pastry cooks'\n",
      "boys skipping along with utter disregard for the safety of the basket\n",
      "balanced on the impish head, and then the lean outcast, the shambling\n",
      "Paris tramp, slouching with shoulders bent and little eye furtively\n",
      "scanning the ground for smokers' refuse;--all these moved in a steady\n",
      "stream across the fountain circle and out into the city by the Odeon,\n",
      "whose long arcades were now beginning to flicker with gas-jets. The\n",
      "melancholy bells of St Sulpice struck the hour and the clock-tower of the\n",
      "Palace lighted up. Then hurried steps sounded across the gravel and\n",
      "Hastings raised his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How late you are,\" he said, but his voice was hoarse and only his flushed\n",
      "face told how long had seemed the waiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said, \"I was kept--indeed, I was so much annoyed--and--and I may only\n",
      "stay a moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat down beside him, casting a furtive glance over her shoulder at the\n",
      "god upon his pedestal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a nuisance, that intruding cupid still there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wings and arrows too,\" said Hastings, unheeding her motion to be seated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wings,\" she murmured, \"oh, yes--to fly away with when he's tired of his\n",
      "play. Of course it was a man who conceived the idea of wings, otherwise\n",
      "Cupid would have been insupportable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Ma foi_, it's what men think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And women?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" she said, with a toss of her small head, \"I really forget what we\n",
      "were speaking of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were speaking of love,\" said Hastings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_I_ was not,\" said the girl. Then looking up at the marble god, \"I don't\n",
      "care for this one at all. I don't believe he knows how to shoot his\n",
      "arrows--no, indeed, he is a coward;--he creeps up like an assassin in the\n",
      "twilight. I don't approve of cowardice,\" she announced, and turned her\n",
      "back on the statue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think,\" said Hastings quietly, \"that he does shoot fairly--yes, and\n",
      "even gives one warning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it your experience, Monsieur Hastings?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked straight into her eyes and said, \"He is warning me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heed the warning then,\" she cried, with a nervous laugh. As she spoke she\n",
      "stripped off her gloves, and then carefully proceeded to draw them on\n",
      "again. When this was accomplished she glanced at the Palace clock, saying,\n",
      "\"Oh dear, how late it is!\" furled her umbrella, then unfurled it, and\n",
      "finally looked at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" he said, \"I shall not heed his warning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh dear,\" she sighed again, \"still talking about that tiresome statue!\"\n",
      "Then stealing a glance at his face, \"I suppose--I suppose you are in\n",
      "love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" he muttered, \"I suppose I am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She raised her head with a quick gesture. \"You seem delighted at the\n",
      "idea,\" she said, but bit her lip and trembled as his eyes met hers. Then\n",
      "sudden fear came over her and she sprang up, staring into the gathering\n",
      "shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you cold?\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she only answered, \"Oh dear, oh dear, it is late--so late! I must\n",
      "go--good-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave him her gloved hand a moment and then withdrew it with a start.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\" he insisted. \"Are you frightened?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at him strangely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--no--not frightened,--you are very good to me--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By Jove!\" he burst out, \"what do you mean by saying I'm good to you?\n",
      "That's at least the third time, and I don't understand!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of a drum from the guard-house at the palace cut him short.\n",
      "\"Listen,\" she whispered, \"they are going to close. It's late, oh, so\n",
      "late!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The rolling of the drum came nearer and nearer, and then the silhouette of\n",
      "the drummer cut the sky above the eastern terrace. The fading light\n",
      "lingered a moment on his belt and bayonet, then he passed into the\n",
      "shadows, drumming the echoes awake. The roll became fainter along the\n",
      "eastern terrace, then grew and grew and rattled with increasing sharpness\n",
      "when he passed the avenue by the bronze lion and turned down the western\n",
      "terrace walk. Louder and louder the drum sounded, and the echoes struck\n",
      "back the notes from the grey palace wall; and now the drummer loomed up\n",
      "before them--his red trousers a dull spot in the gathering gloom, the\n",
      "brass of his drum and bayonet touched with a pale spark, his epaulettes\n",
      "tossing on his shoulders. He passed leaving the crash of the drum in their\n",
      "ears, and far into the alley of trees they saw his little tin cup shining\n",
      "on his haversack. Then the sentinels began the monotonous cry: \"On ferme!\n",
      "on ferme!\" and the bugle blew from the barracks in the rue de Tournon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On ferme! on ferme!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-night,\" she whispered, \"I must return alone to-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He watched her until she reached the northern terrace, and then sat down\n",
      "on the marble seat until a hand on his shoulder and a glimmer of bayonets\n",
      "warned him away.\n",
      "\n",
      "She passed on through the grove, and turning into the rue de Medici,\n",
      "traversed it to the Boulevard. At the corner she bought a bunch of violets\n",
      "and walked on along the Boulevard to the rue des Écoles. A cab was drawn\n",
      "up before Boulant's, and a pretty girl aided by Elliott jumped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Valentine!\" cried the girl, \"come with us!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't,\" she said, stopping a moment--\"I have a rendezvous at Mignon's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not Victor?\" cried the girl, laughing, but she passed with a little\n",
      "shiver, nodding good-night, then turning into the Boulevard St. Germain,\n",
      "she walked a tittle faster to escape a gay party sitting before the Café\n",
      "Cluny who called to her to join them. At the door of the Restaurant Mignon\n",
      "stood a coal-black negro in buttons. He took off his peaked cap as she\n",
      "mounted the carpeted stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Send Eugene to me,\" she said at the office, and passing through the\n",
      "hallway to the right of the dining-room stopped before a row of panelled\n",
      "doors. A waiter passed and she repeated her demand for Eugene, who\n",
      "presently appeared, noiselessly skipping, and bowed murmuring, \"Madame.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No one in the cabinets, madame; in the half Madame Madelon and Monsieur\n",
      "Gay, Monsieur de Clamart, Monsieur Clisson, Madame Marie and their set.\"\n",
      "Then he looked around and bowing again murmured, \"Monsieur awaits madame\n",
      "since half an hour,\" and he knocked at one of the panelled doors bearing\n",
      "the number six.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clifford opened the door and the girl entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The garçon bowed her in, and whispering, \"Will Monsieur have the goodness\n",
      "to ring?\" vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "He helped her off with her jacket and took her hat and umbrella. When she\n",
      "was seated at the little table with Clifford opposite she smiled and\n",
      "leaned forward on both elbows looking him in the face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you doing here?\" she demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Waiting,\" he replied, in accents of adoration.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an instant she turned and examined herself in the glass. The wide blue\n",
      "eyes, the curling hair, the straight nose and short curled lip flashed in\n",
      "the mirror an instant only, and then its depths reflected her pretty neck\n",
      "and back. \"Thus do I turn my back on vanity,\" she said, and then leaning\n",
      "forward again, \"What are you doing here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Waiting for you,\" repeated Clifford, slightly troubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And Cécile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now don't, Valentine--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know,\" she said calmly, \"I dislike your conduct?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a little disconcerted, and rang for Eugene to cover his confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soup was bisque, and the wine Pommery, and the courses followed each\n",
      "other with the usual regularity until Eugene brought coffee, and there was\n",
      "nothing left on the table but a small silver lamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Valentine,\" said Clifford, after having obtained permission to smoke, \"is\n",
      "it the Vaudeville or the Eldorado--or both, or the Nouveau Cirque, or--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is here,\" said Valentine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" he said, greatly flattered, \"I'm afraid I couldn't amuse you--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, you are funnier than the Eldorado.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now see here, don't guy me, Valentine. You always do, and, and,--you know\n",
      "what they say,--a good laugh kills--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Er--er--love and all that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed until her eyes were moist with tears. \"Tiens,\" she cried, \"he\n",
      "is dead, then!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Clifford eyed her with growing alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know why I came?\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" he replied uneasily, \"I don't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How long have you made love to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" he admitted, somewhat startled,--\"I should say,--for about a\n",
      "year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a year, I think. Are you not tired?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you know that I like you too well to--to ever fall in love with\n",
      "you?\" she said. \"Don't you know that we are too good comrades,--too old\n",
      "friends for that? And were we not,--do you think that I do not know your\n",
      "history, Monsieur Clifford?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be--don't be so sarcastic,\" he urged; \"don't be unkind, Valentine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not. I'm kind. I'm very kind,--to you and to Cécile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cécile is tired of me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope she is,\" said the girl, \"for she deserves a better fate. Tiens, do\n",
      "you know your reputation in the Quarter? Of the inconstant, the most\n",
      "inconstant,--utterly incorrigible and no more serious than a gnat on a\n",
      "summer night. Poor Cécile!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Clifford looked so uncomfortable that she spoke more kindly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like you. You know that. Everybody does. You are a spoiled child here.\n",
      "Everything is permitted you and every one makes allowance, but every one\n",
      "cannot be a victim to caprice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caprice!\" he cried. \"By Jove, if the girls of the Latin Quarter are not\n",
      "capricious--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind,--never mind about that! You must not sit in judgment--you of\n",
      "all men. Why are you here to-night? Oh,\" she cried, \"I will tell you why!\n",
      "Monsieur receives a little note; he sends a little answer; he dresses in\n",
      "his conquering raiment--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't,\" said Clifford, very red.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do, and it becomes you,\" she retorted with a faint smile. Then again,\n",
      "very quietly, \"I am in your power, but I know I am in the power of a\n",
      "friend. I have come to acknowledge it to you here,--and it is because of\n",
      "that that I am here to beg of you--a--a favour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Clifford opened his eyes, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am in--great distress of mind. It is Monsieur Hastings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\" said Clifford, in some astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to ask you,\" she continued in a low voice, \"I want to ask you\n",
      "to--to--in case you should speak of me before him,--not to say,--not to\n",
      "say,--\"\n",
      "\n",

      "find out--sooner or later, he will find out for himself, and then he will\n",
      "turn away from me. Why!\" she cried passionately, \"why should he turn from\n",

      "The month passed quickly for Hastings, and left few definite impressions\n",
      "after it. It did leave some, however. One was a painful impression of\n",
      "meeting Mr. Bladen on the Boulevard des Capucines in company with a very\n",
      "pronounced young person whose laugh dismayed him, and when at last he\n",
      "escaped from the café where Mr. Bladen had hauled him to join them in a\n",
      "_bock_ he felt as if the whole boulevard was looking at him, and judging\n",
      "him by his company. Later, an instinctive conviction regarding the young\n",
      "person with Mr. Bladen sent the hot blood into his cheek, and he returned\n",
      "to the pension in such a miserable state of mind that Miss Byng was\n",
      "alarmed and advised him to conquer his homesickness at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another impression was equally vivid. One Saturday morning, feeling\n",
      "lonely, his wanderings about the city brought him to the Gare St. Lazare.\n",
      "It was early for breakfast, but he entered the Hôtel Terminus and took a\n",
      "table near the window. As he wheeled about to give his order, a man\n",
      "passing rapidly along the aisle collided with his head, and looking up to\n",
      "receive the expected apology, he was met instead by a slap on the shoulder\n",
      "and a hearty, \"What the deuce are you doing here, old chap?\" It was\n",
      "Rowden, who seized him and told him to come along. So, mildly protesting,\n",
      "he was ushered into a private dining-room where Clifford, rather red,\n",
      "jumped up from the table and welcomed him with a startled air which was\n",
      "softened by the unaffected glee of Rowden and the extreme courtesy of\n",
      "Elliott. The latter presented him to three bewitching girls who welcomed\n",
      "him so charmingly and seconded Rowden in his demand that Hastings should\n",
      "make one of the party, that he consented at once. While Elliott briefly\n",
      "outlined the projected excursion to La Roche, Hastings delightedly ate his\n",
      "omelet, and returned the smiles of encouragement from Cécile and Colette\n",
      "and Jacqueline. Meantime Clifford in a bland whisper was telling Rowden\n",
      "what an ass he was. Poor Rowden looked miserable until Elliott, divining\n",
      "how affairs were turning, frowned on Clifford and found a moment to let\n",
      "Rowden know that they were all going to make the best of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You shut up,\" he observed to Clifford, \"it's fate, and that settles it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's Rowden, and that settles it,\" murmured Clifford, concealing a grin.\n",
      "For after all he was not Hastings' wet nurse. So it came about that the\n",
      "train which left the Gare St. Lazare at 9.15 a.m. stopped a moment in its\n",
      "career towards Havre and deposited at the red-roofed station of La Roche a\n",
      "merry party, armed with sunshades, trout-rods, and one cane, carried by\n",
      "the non-combatant, Hastings. Then, when they had established their camp in\n",
      "a grove of sycamores which bordered the little river Ept, Clifford, the\n",
      "acknowledged master of all that pertained to sportsmanship, took command.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You, Rowden,\" he said, \"divide your flies with Elliott and keep an eye on\n",

      "But Cécile, doubtless fascinated by the gaudy flies in Clifford's book,\n",
      "decided to accept lessons from him in the true art, and presently\n",
      "disappeared up the Ept with Clifford in tow.\n",

      "\"Certainly,\" responded Jacqueline.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Don't call it a pole,\" corrected Rowden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Rod_, then,\" continued Elliott, and started off in the wake of the two\n",
      "girls, but was promptly collared by Rowden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you don't! Fancy a man fishing with a float and sinker when he has a\n",

      "of the scarlet quills, while Hastings, his hat over his eyes, his head on\n",
      "a bank of moss, listened to their soft voices and gallantly unhooked the\n",
      "small and indignant gudgeon when a flash of a rod and a half-suppressed\n",
      "scream announced a catch. The sunlight filtered through the leafy thickets\n",
      "awaking to song the forest birds. Magpies in spotless black and white\n",
      "flirted past, alighting near by with a hop and bound and twitch of the\n",
      "tail. Blue and white jays with rosy breasts shrieked through the trees,\n",
      "and a low-sailing hawk wheeled among the fields of ripening wheat, putting\n",
      "to flight flocks of twittering hedge birds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the Seine a gull dropped on the water like a plume. The air was\n",
      "pure and still. Scarcely a leaf moved. Sounds from a distant farm came\n",
      "faintly, the shrill cock-crow and dull baying. Now and then a steam-tug\n",
      "with big raking smoke-pipe, bearing the name \"Guêpe 27,\" ploughed up the\n",
      "river dragging its interminable train of barges, or a sailboat dropped\n",
      "down with the current toward sleepy Rouen.\n",
      "\n",
      "A faint fresh odour of earth and water hung in the air, and through the\n",
      "sunlight, orange-tipped butterflies danced above the marsh grass, soft\n",
      "velvety butterflies flapped through the mossy woods.\n",

      "beside Colette and prepared to doze with satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are your trout?\" said Colette severely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They still live,\" murmured Elliott, and went fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rowden returned shortly after, and casting a scornful glance at the\n",
      "slumbering one, displayed three crimson-flecked trout.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And that,\" smiled Hastings lazily, \"that is the holy end to which the\n",

      "feather.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rowden disdained to answer him. Colette caught another gudgeon and awoke\n",
      "Elliott, who protested and gazed about for the lunch baskets, as Clifford\n",
      "and Cécile came up demanding instant refreshment. Cécile's skirts were\n",
      "soaked, and her gloves torn, but she was happy, and Clifford, dragging out\n",
      "a two-pound trout, stood still to receive the applause of the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where the deuce did you get that?\" demanded Elliott.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cécile, wet and enthusiastic, recounted the battle, and then Clifford\n",
      "eulogized her powers with the fly, and, in proof, produced from his creel\n",
      "a defunct chub, which, he observed, just missed being a trout.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were all very happy at luncheon, and Hastings was voted \"charming.\"\n",
      "He enjoyed it immensely,--only it seemed to him at moments that flirtation\n",
      "went further in France than in Millbrook, Connecticut, and he thought that\n",
      "Cécile might be a little less enthusiastic about Clifford, that perhaps it\n",
      "would be quite as well if Jacqueline sat further away from Rowden, and\n",
      "that possibly Colette could have, for a moment at least, taken her eyes\n",
      "from Elliott's face. Still he enjoyed it--except when his thoughts drifted\n",
      "to Valentine, and then he felt that he was very far away from her. La\n",
      "Roche is at least an hour and a half from Paris. It is also true that he\n",
      "felt a happiness, a quick heart-beat when, at eight o'clock that night the\n",
      "train which bore them from La Roche rolled into the Gare St. Lazare and he\n",
      "was once more in the city of Valentine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-night,\" they said, pressing around him. \"You must come with us next\n",
      "time!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He promised, and watched them, two by two, drift into the darkening city,\n",
      "and stood so long that, when again he raised his eyes, the vast Boulevard\n",
      "was twinkling with gas-jets through which the electric lights stared like\n",
      "moons.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VI\n",
      "\n",
      "It was with another quick heart-beat that he awoke next morning, for his\n",
      "first thought was of Valentine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun already gilded the towers of Notre Dame, the clatter of workmen's\n",
      "sabots awoke sharp echoes in the street below, and across the way a\n",
      "blackbird in a pink almond tree was going into an ecstasy of trills.\n",
      "\n",
      "He determined to awake Clifford for a brisk walk in the country, hoping\n",
      "later to beguile that gentleman into the American church for his soul's\n",
      "sake. He found Alfred the gimlet-eyed washing the asphalt walk which led\n",
      "to the studio.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Monsieur Elliott?\" he replied to the perfunctory inquiry, \"_je ne sais\n",
      "pas_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And Monsieur Clifford,\" began Hastings, somewhat astonished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Monsieur Clifford,\" said the concierge with fine irony, \"will be pleased\n",
      "to see you, as he retired early; in fact he has just come in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings hesitated while the concierge pronounced a fine eulogy on people\n",
      "who never stayed out all night and then came battering at the lodge gate\n",
      "during hours which even a gendarme held sacred to sleep. He also\n",
      "discoursed eloquently upon the beauties of temperance, and took an\n",
      "ostentatious draught from the fountain in the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not think I will come in,\" said Hastings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon, monsieur,\" growled the concierge, \"perhaps it would be well to\n",
      "see Monsieur Clifford. He possibly needs aid. Me he drives forth with\n",
      "hair-brushes and boots. It is a mercy if he has not set fire to something\n",
      "with his candle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings hesitated for an instant, but swallowing his dislike of such a\n",
      "mission, walked slowly through the ivy-covered alley and across the inner\n",
      "garden to the studio. He knocked. Perfect silence. Then he knocked again,\n",
      "and this time something struck the door from within with a crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That,\" said the concierge, \"was a boot.\" He fitted his duplicate key into\n",
      "the lock and ushered Hastings in. Clifford, in disordered evening dress,\n",
      "sat on the rug in the middle of the room. He held in his hand a shoe, and\n",
      "did not appear astonished to see Hastings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-morning, do you use Pears' soap?\" he inquired with a vague wave of\n",
      "his hand and a vaguer smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings' heart sank. \"For Heaven's sake,\" he said, \"Clifford, go to bed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not while that--that Alfred pokes his shaggy head in here an' I have a\n",
      "shoe left.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings blew out the candle, picked up Clifford's hat and cane, and said,\n",
      "with an emotion he could not conceal, \"This is terrible,\n",
      "Clifford,--I--never knew you did this sort of thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I do,\" said Clifford.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is Elliott?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ole chap,\" returned Clifford, becoming maudlin, \"Providence which\n",
      "feeds--feeds--er--sparrows an' that sort of thing watcheth over the\n",
      "intemperate wanderer--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is Elliott?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Clifford only wagged his head and waved his arm about. \"He's out\n",
      "there,--somewhere about.\" Then suddenly feeling a desire to see his\n",
      "missing chum, lifted up his voice and howled for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings, thoroughly shocked, sat down on the lounge without a word.\n",
      "Presently, after shedding several scalding tears, Clifford brightened up\n",
      "and rose with great precaution.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ole chap,\" he observed, \"do you want to see er--er miracle? Well, here\n",
      "goes. I'm goin' to begin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, beaming at vacancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Er miracle,\" he repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings supposed he was alluding to the miracle of his keeping his\n",
      "balance, and said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm goin' to bed,\" he announced, \"poor ole Clifford's goin' to bed, an'\n",
      "that's er miracle!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he did with a nice calculation of distance and equilibrium which would\n",
      "have rung enthusiastic yells of applause from Elliott had he been there to\n",
      "assist _en connaisseur_. But he was not. He had not yet reached the\n",
      "studio. He was on his way, however, and smiled with magnificent\n",
      "condescension on Hastings, who, half an hour later, found him reclining\n",
      "upon a bench in the Luxembourg. He permitted himself to be aroused, dusted\n",
      "and escorted to the gate. Here, however, he refused all further\n",
      "assistance, and bestowing a patronizing bow upon Hastings, steered a\n",
      "tolerably true course for the rue Vavin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hastings watched him out of sight, and then slowly retraced his steps\n",
      "toward the fountain. At first he felt gloomy and depressed, but gradually\n",
      "the clear air of the morning lifted the pressure from his heart, and he\n",
      "sat down on the marble seat under the shadow of the winged god.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air was fresh and sweet with perfume from the orange flowers.\n",
      "Everywhere pigeons were bathing, dashing the water over their iris-hued\n",
      "breasts, flashing in and out of the spray or nestling almost to the neck\n",
      "along the polished basin. The sparrows, too, were abroad in force, soaking\n",
      "their dust-coloured feathers in the limpid pool and chirping with might\n",
      "and main. Under the sycamores which surrounded the duck-pond opposite the\n",
      "fountain of Marie de Medici, the water-fowl cropped the herbage, or\n",
      "waddled in rows down the bank to embark on some solemn aimless cruise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Butterflies, somewhat lame from a chilly night's repose under the lilac\n",
      "leaves, crawled over and over the white phlox, or took a rheumatic flight\n",
      "toward some sun-warmed shrub. The bees were already busy among the\n",
      "heliotrope, and one or two grey flies with brick-coloured eyes sat in a\n",
      "spot of sunlight beside the marble seat, or chased each other about, only\n",
      "to return again to the spot of sunshine and rub their fore-legs, exulting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sentries paced briskly before the painted boxes, pausing at times to\n",
      "look toward the guard-house for their relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "They came at last, with a shuffle of feet and click of bayonets, the word\n",
      "was passed, the relief fell out, and away they went, crunch, crunch,\n",
      "across the gravel.\n",
      "\n",
      "A mellow chime floated from the clock-tower of the palace, the deep bell\n",
      "of St. Sulpice echoed the stroke. Hastings sat dreaming in the shadow of\n",
      "the god, and while he mused somebody came and sat down beside him. At\n",
      "first he did not raise his head. It was only when she spoke that he sprang\n",
      "up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You! At this hour?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was restless, I could not sleep.\" Then in a low, happy voice--\"And\n",
      "_you!_ at this hour?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I--I slept, but the sun awoke me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_I_ could not sleep,\" she said, and her eyes seemed, for a moment,\n",
      "touched with an indefinable shadow. Then, smiling, \"I am so glad--I seemed\n",
      "to know you were coming. Don't laugh, I believe in dreams.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you really dream of,--of my being here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I was awake when I dreamed it,\" she admitted. Then for a time\n",
      "they were mute, acknowledging by silence the happiness of being together.\n",
      "And after all their silence was eloquent, for faint smiles, and glances\n",
      "born of their thoughts, crossed and recrossed, until lips moved and words\n",
      "were formed, which seemed almost superfluous. What they said was not very\n",
      "profound. Perhaps the most valuable jewel that fell from Hastings' lips\n",
      "bore direct reference to breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not yet had my chocolate,\" she confessed, \"but what a material man\n",

      "woman who speaks French like a native, and rejoices in the name of Murphy,\n",
      "smiled at them as they entered, and tossing a fresh napkin over the zinc\n",

      "in arms, and he denying it, and bringing counter charges, until\n",
      "Mademoiselle Murphy laughed in sympathy, and the last croisson was eaten\n",
      "under a flag of truce. Then they rose, and she took his arm with a bright\n",
      "nod to Mile. Murphy, who cried them a merry: \"_Bonjour, madame! bonjour,\n",

      "slammed the door of their compartment, a whistle sounded, answered by a\n",
      "screech from the locomotive, and the long train glided from the station,\n",
      "faster, faster, and sped out into the morning sunshine. The summer wind\n",
      "blew in their faces from the open window, and sent the soft hair dancing\n",

      "under her chin. With a quick movement she untied them, and, drawing a long\n",
      "hat-pin from her hat, laid it down on the seat beside her. The train was\n",
      "flying.\n",
      "\n",
      "The colour surged in her cheeks, and, with each quick-drawn breath, her\n",
      "breath rose and fell under the cluster of lilies at her throat. Trees,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Faster! faster!\" she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "His eyes never left her, but hers, wide open, and blue as the summer sky,\n",
      "seemed fixed on something far ahead,--something which came no nearer, but\n",
      "fled before them as they fled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it the horizon, cut now by the grim fortress on the hill, now by the\n",
      "cross of a country chapel? Was it the summer moon, ghost-like, slipping\n",
      "through the vaguer blue above?\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" she cried, and with an unconscious movement caught his hand, drawing\n",
      "him to the window beside her. \"Look! lean out with me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He only saw her lips move; her voice was drowned in the roar of a trestle,\n",
      "but his hand closed in hers and he clung to the sill. The wind whistled in\n",
      "their ears. \"Not so far out, Valentine, take care!\" he gasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below, through the ties of the trestle, a broad river flashed into view\n",
      "and out again, as the train thundered along a tunnel, and away once more\n",
      "through the freshest of green fields. The wind roared about them. The girl\n",
      "was leaning far out from the window, and he caught her by the waist,\n",
      "crying, \"Not too far!\" but she only murmured, \"Faster! faster! away out of\n",
      "the city, out of the land, faster, faster! away out of the world!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you saying all to yourself?\" he said, but his voice was broken,\n",
      "and the wind whirled it back into his throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "She heard him, and, turning from the window looked down at his arm about\n",
      "her. Then she raised her eyes to his. The car shook and the windows\n",
      "rattled. They were dashing through a forest now, and the sun swept the\n",
      "dewy branches with running flashes of fire. He looked into her troubled\n",
      "eyes; he drew her to him and kissed the half-parted lips, and she cried\n",
      "out, a bitter, hopeless cry, \"Not that--not that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he held her close and strong, whispering words of honest love and\n",
      "passion, and when she sobbed--\"Not that--not that--I have promised! You\n",
      "must--you must know--I am--not--worthy--\" In the purity of his own heart\n",
      "her words were, to him, meaningless then, meaningless for ever after.\n",
      "Presently her voice ceased, and her head rested on his breast. He leaned\n",
      "against the window, his ears swept by the furious wind, his heart in a\n",
      "joyous tumult. The forest was passed, and the sun slipped from behind the\n",
      "trees, flooding the earth again with brightness. She raised her eyes and\n",
      "looked out into the world from the window. Then she began to speak, but\n",
      "her voice was faint, and he bent his head close to hers and listened. \"I\n",
      "cannot turn from you; I am too weak. You were long ago my master--master\n",
      "of my heart and soul. I have broken my word to one who trusted me, but I\n",
      "have told you all;--what matters the rest?\" He smiled at her innocence and\n",
      "she worshipped his. She spoke again: \"Take me or cast me away;--what\n",
      "matters it? Now with a word you can kill me, and it might be easier to die\n",
      "than to look upon happiness as great as mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He took her in his arms, \"Hush, what are you saying? Look,--look out at\n",
      "the sunlight, the meadows and the streams. We shall be very happy in so\n",
      "bright a world.\"\n",

      "She turned to the sunlight. From the window, the world below seemed very\n",

      "easel, doing nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selby, shy and nervous, walked over and began: \"My name is Selby,--I have\n",
      "just arrived in Paris, and bring a letter of introduction--\" His voice was\n",
      "lost in the crash of a falling easel, the owner of which promptly\n",
      "assaulted his neighbour, and for a time the noise of battle rolled through\n",
      "the studios of MM. Boulanger and Lefebvre, presently subsiding into a\n",
      "scuffle on the stairs outside. Selby, apprehensive as to his own reception\n",
      "in the studio, looked at Clifford, who sat serenely watching the fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a little noisy here,\" said Clifford, \"but you will like the fellows\n",
      "when you know them.\" His unaffected manner delighted Selby. Then with a\n",
      "simplicity that won his heart, he presented him to half a dozen students\n",
      "of as many nationalities. Some were cordial, all were polite. Even the\n",
      "majestic creature who held the position of Massier, unbent enough to say:\n",
      "\"My friend, when a man speaks French as well as you do, and is also a\n",
      "friend of Monsieur Clifford, he will have no trouble in this studio. You\n",
      "expect, of course, to fill the stove until the next new man comes?\"\n",

      "at first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Selby placed his own hat on his head and followed him to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they passed the model stand there was a furious cry of \"Chapeau!\n",
      "Chapeau!\" and a student sprang from his easel menacing Selby, who reddened\n",
      "but looked at Clifford.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take off your hat for them,\" said the latter, laughing.\n",

      "A little embarrassed, he turned and saluted the studio.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Et moi?\" cried the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are charming,\" replied Selby, astonished at his own audacity, but the\n",
      "studio rose as one man, shouting: \"He has done well! he's all right!\"\n",
      "while the model, laughing, kissed her hand to him and cried: \"À demain\n",
      "beau jeune homme!\"\n",

      "All that week Selby worked at the studio unmolested. The French students\n",
      "christened him \"l'Enfant Prodigue,\" which was freely translated, \"The\n",

      "soon ran its course from \"Kidby\" to \"Kidney,\" and then naturally to\n",

      "Wednesday came, and with it M. Boulanger. For three hours the students\n",
      "writhed under his biting sarcasms,--among the others Clifford, who was\n",
      "informed that he knew even less about a work of art than he did about the\n",
      "art of work. Selby was more fortunate. The professor examined his drawing\n",
      "in silence, looked at him sharply, and passed on with a non-committal\n",
      "gesture. He presently departed arm in arm with Bouguereau, to the relief\n",
      "of Clifford, who was then at liberty to jam his hat on his head and\n",
      "depart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day he did not appear, and Selby, who had counted on seeing him\n",
      "at the studio, a thing which he learned later it was vanity to count on,\n",
      "wandered back to the Latin Quarter alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paris was still strange and new to him. He was vaguely troubled by its\n",
      "splendour. No tender memories stirred his American bosom at the Place du\n",
      "Châtelet, nor even by Notre Dame. The Palais de Justice with its clock and\n",
      "turrets and stalking sentinels in blue and vermilion, the Place St. Michel\n",
      "with its jumble of omnibuses and ugly water-spitting griffins, the hill of\n",
      "the Boulevard St. Michel, the tooting trams, the policemen dawdling two by\n",
      "two, and the table-lined terraces of the Café Vacehett were nothing to\n",
      "him, as yet, nor did he even know, when he stepped from the stones of the\n",
      "Place St. Michel to the asphalt of the Boulevard, that he had crossed the\n",
      "frontier and entered the student zone,--the famous Latin Quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cabman hailed him as \"bourgeois,\" and urged the superiority of driving\n",
      "over walking. A gamin, with an appearance of great concern, requested the\n",
      "latest telegraphic news from London, and then, standing on his head,\n",
      "invited Selby to feats of strength. A pretty girl gave him a glance from a\n",
      "pair of violet eyes. He did not see her, but she, catching her own\n",
      "reflection in a window, wondered at the colour burning in her cheeks.\n",
      "Turning to resume her course, she met Foxhall Clifford, and hurried on.\n",
      "Clifford, open-mouthed, followed her with his eyes; then he looked after\n",
      "Selby, who had turned into the Boulevard St. Germain toward the rue de\n",
      "Seine. Then he examined himself in the shop window. The result seemed to\n",
      "be unsatisfactory.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not a beauty,\" he mused, \"but neither am I a hobgoblin. What does she\n",
      "mean by blushing at Selby? I never before saw her look at a fellow in my\n",
      "life,--neither has any one in the Quarter. Anyway, I can swear she never\n",
      "looks at me, and goodness knows I have done all that respectful adoration\n",
      "can do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He sighed, and murmuring a prophecy concerning the salvation of his\n",
      "immortal soul swung into that graceful lounge which at all times\n",
      "characterized Clifford. With no apparent exertion, he overtook Selby at\n",
      "the corner, and together they crossed the sunlit Boulevard and sat down\n",
      "under the awning of the Café du Cercle. Clifford bowed to everybody on the\n",
      "terrace, saying, \"You shall meet them all later, but now let me present\n",
      "you to two of the sights of Paris, Mr. Richard Elliott and Mr. Stanley\n",
      "Rowden.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"sights\" looked amiable, and took vermouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cut the studio to-day,\" said Elliott, suddenly turning on Clifford,\n",
      "who avoided his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To commune with nature?\" observed Rowden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's her name this time?\" asked Elliott, and Rowden answered promptly,\n",
      "\"Name, Yvette; nationality, Breton--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wrong,\" replied Clifford blandly, \"it's Rue Barrée.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject changed instantly, and Selby listened in surprise to names\n",
      "which were new to him, and eulogies on the latest Prix de Rome winner. He\n",
      "was delighted to hear opinions boldly expressed and points honestly\n",
      "debated, although the vehicle was mostly slang, both English and French.\n",
      "He longed for the time when he too should be plunged into the strife for\n",
      "fame.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bells of St. Sulpice struck the hour, and the Palace of the Luxembourg\n",
      "answered chime on chime. With a glance at the sun, dipping low in the\n",
      "golden dust behind the Palais Bourbon, they rose, and turning to the east,\n",
      "crossed the Boulevard St. Germain and sauntered toward the École de\n",
      "Médecine. At the corner a girl passed them, walking hurriedly. Clifford\n",
      "smirked, Elliot and Rowden were agitated, but they all bowed, and, without\n",
      "raising her eyes, she returned their salute. But Selby, who had lagged\n",
      "behind, fascinated by some gay shop window, looked up to meet two of the\n",
      "bluest eyes he had ever seen. The eyes were dropped in an instant, and the\n",
      "young fellow hastened to overtake the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By Jove,\" he said, \"do you fellows know I have just seen the prettiest\n",
      "girl--\" An exclamation broke from the trio, gloomy, foreboding, like the\n",
      "chorus in a Greek play.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rue Barrée!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" cried Selby, bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only answer was a vague gesture from Clifford.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two hours later, during dinner, Clifford turned to Selby and said, \"You\n",
      "want to ask me something; I can tell by the way you fidget about.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I do,\" he said, innocently enough; \"it's about that girl. Who is\n",
      "she?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In Rowden's smile there was pity, in Elliott's bitterness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her name,\" said Clifford solemnly, \"is unknown to any one, at least,\" he\n",
      "added with much conscientiousness, \"as far as I can learn. Every fellow in\n",
      "the Quarter bows to her and she returns the salute gravely, but no man has\n",
      "ever been known to obtain more than that. Her profession, judging from her\n",
      "music-roll, is that of a pianist. Her residence is in a small and humble\n",
      "street which is kept in a perpetual process of repair by the city\n",
      "authorities, and from the black letters painted on the barrier which\n",
      "defends the street from traffic, she has taken the name by which we know\n",
      "her,--Rue Barrée. Mr. Rowden, in his imperfect knowledge of the French\n",
      "tongue, called our attention to it as Roo Barry--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't,\" said Rowden hotly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And Roo Barry, or Rue Barrée, is to-day an object of adoration to every\n",
      "rapin in the Quarter--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are not rapins,\" corrected Elliott.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_I_ am not,\" returned Clifford, \"and I beg to call to your attention,\n",
      "Selby, that these two gentlemen have at various and apparently unfortunate\n",
      "moments, offered to lay down life and limb at the feet of Rue Barrée. The\n",
      "lady possesses a chilling smile which she uses on such occasions and,\"\n",
      "here he became gloomily impressive, \"I have been forced to believe that\n",
      "neither the scholarly grace of my friend Elliott nor the buxom beauty of\n",
      "my friend Rowden have touched that heart of ice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elliott and Rowden, boiling with indignation, cried out, \"And you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I,\" said Clifford blandly, \"do fear to tread where you rush in.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Twenty-four hours later Selby had completely forgotten Rue Barrée. During\n",
      "the week he worked with might and main at the studio, and Saturday night\n",
      "found him so tired that he went to bed before dinner and had a nightmare\n",
      "about a river of yellow ochre in which he was drowning. Sunday morning,\n",
      "apropos of nothing at all, he thought of Rue Barrée, and ten seconds\n",
      "afterwards he saw her. It was at the flower-market on the marble bridge.\n",
      "She was examining a pot of pansies. The gardener had evidently thrown\n",
      "heart and soul into the transaction, but Rue Barrée shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a question whether Selby would have stopped then and there to\n",
      "inspect a cabbage-rose had not Clifford unwound for him the yarn of the\n",
      "previous Tuesday. It is possible that his curiosity was piqued, for with\n",
      "the exception of a hen-turkey, a boy of nineteen is the most openly\n",
      "curious biped alive. From twenty until death he tries to conceal it. But,\n",
      "to be fair to Selby, it is also true that the market was attractive. Under\n",
      "a cloudless sky the flowers were packed and heaped along the marble bridge\n",
      "to the parapet. The air was soft, the sun spun a shadowy lacework among\n",
      "the palms and glowed in the hearts of a thousand roses. Spring had\n",
      "come,--was in full tide. The watering carts and sprinklers spread\n",
      "freshness over the Boulevard, the sparrows had become vulgarly obtrusive,\n",
      "and the credulous Seine angler anxiously followed his gaudy quill floating\n",
      "among the soapsuds of the lavoirs. The white-spiked chestnuts clad in\n",
      "tender green vibrated with the hum of bees. Shoddy butterflies flaunted\n",
      "their winter rags among the heliotrope. There was a smell of fresh earth\n",
      "in the air, an echo of the woodland brook in the ripple of the Seine, and\n",
      "swallows soared and skimmed among the anchored river craft. Somewhere in a\n",
      "window a caged bird was singing its heart out to the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selby looked at the cabbage-rose and then at the sky. Something in the\n",
      "song of the caged bird may have moved him, or perhaps it was that\n",
      "dangerous sweetness in the air of May.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first he was hardly conscious that he had stopped then he was scarcely\n",
      "conscious why he had stopped, then he thought he would move on, then he\n",
      "thought he wouldn't, then he looked at Rue Barrée.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gardener said, \"Mademoiselle, this is undoubtedly a fine pot of\n",
      "pansies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rue Barrée shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gardener smiled. She evidently did not want the pansies. She had\n",
      "bought many pots of pansies there, two or three every spring, and never\n",
      "argued. What did she want then? The pansies were evidently a feeler toward\n",
      "a more important transaction. The gardener rubbed his hands and gazed\n",
      "about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These tulips are magnificent,\" he observed, \"and these hyacinths--\" He\n",
      "fell into a trance at the mere sight of the scented thickets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That,\" murmured Rue, pointing to a splendid rose-bush with her furled\n",
      "parasol, but in spite of her, her voice trembled a little. Selby noticed\n",
      "it, more shame to him that he was listening, and the gardener noticed it,\n",
      "and, burying his nose in the roses, scented a bargain. Still, to do him\n",
      "justice, he did not add a centime to the honest value of the plant, for\n",
      "after all, Rue was probably poor, and any one could see she was charming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fifty francs, Mademoiselle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The gardener's tone was grave. Rue felt that argument would be wasted.\n",
      "They both stood silent for a moment. The gardener did not eulogize his\n",
      "prize,--the rose-tree was gorgeous and any one could see it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will take the pansies,\" said the girl, and drew two francs from a worn\n",
      "purse. Then she looked up. A tear-drop stood in the way refracting the\n",
      "light like a diamond, but as it rolled into a little corner by her nose a\n",
      "vision of Selby replaced it, and when a brush of the handkerchief had\n",
      "cleared the startled blue eyes, Selby himself appeared, very much\n",
      "embarrassed. He instantly looked up into the sky, apparently devoured with\n",
      "a thirst for astronomical research, and as he continued his investigations\n",
      "for fully five minutes, the gardener looked up too, and so did a\n",
      "policeman. Then Selby looked at the tips of his boots, the gardener looked\n",
      "at him and the policeman slouched on. Rue Barrée had been gone some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What,\" said the gardener, \"may I offer Monsieur?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Selby never knew why, but he suddenly began to buy flowers. The gardener\n",
      "was electrified. Never before had he sold so many flowers, never at such\n",
      "satisfying prices, and never, never with such absolute unanimity of\n",
      "opinion with a customer. But he missed the bargaining, the arguing, the\n",
      "calling of Heaven to witness. The transaction lacked spice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These tulips are magnificent!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are!\" cried Selby warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But alas, they are dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will take them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dieu!\" murmured the gardener in a perspiration, \"he's madder than most\n",
      "Englishmen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This cactus--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is gorgeous!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Send it with the rest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The gardener braced himself against the river wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That splendid rose-bush,\" he began faintly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a beauty. I believe it is fifty francs--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped, very red. The gardener relished his confusion. Then a sudden\n",
      "cool self-possession took the place of his momentary confusion and he held\n",
      "the gardener with his eye, and bullied him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll take that bush. Why did not the young lady buy it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mademoiselle is not wealthy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you know?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Dame_, I sell her many pansies; pansies are not expensive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Those are the pansies she bought?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These, Monsieur, the blue and gold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you intend to send them to her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At mid-day after the market.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take this rose-bush with them, and\"--here he glared at the\n",
      "gardener--\"don't you dare say from whom they came.\" The gardener's eyes\n",
      "were like saucers, but Selby, calm and victorious, said: \"Send the others\n",
      "to the Hôtel du Sénat, 7 rue de Tournon. I will leave directions with the\n",
      "concierge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he buttoned his glove with much dignity and stalked off, but when\n",
      "well around the corner and hidden from the gardener's view, the conviction\n",
      "that he was an idiot came home to him in a furious blush. Ten minutes\n",
      "later he sat in his room in the Hôtel du Sénat repeating with an imbecile\n",
      "smile: \"What an ass I am, what an ass!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "An hour later found him in the same chair, in the same position, his hat\n",
      "and gloves still on, his stick in his hand, but he was silent, apparently\n",
      "lost in contemplation of his boot toes, and his smile was less imbecile\n",
      "and even a bit retrospective.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "III\n",
      "\n",
      "About five o'clock that afternoon, the little sad-eyed woman who fills the\n",
      "position of concierge at the Hôtel du Sénat held up her hands in amazement\n",
      "to see a wagon-load of flower-bearing shrubs draw up before the doorway.\n",
      "She called Joseph, the intemperate garçon, who, while calculating the\n",
      "value of the flowers in _petits verres_, gloomily disclaimed any knowledge\n",
      "as to their destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Voyons_,\" said the little concierge, \"_cherchons la femme_!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You?\" he suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little woman stood a moment pensive and then sighed. Joseph caressed\n",
      "his nose, a nose which for gaudiness could vie with any floral display.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the gardener came in, hat in hand, and a few minutes later Selby\n",
      "stood in the middle of his room, his coat off, his shirt-sleeves rolled\n",
      "up. The chamber originally contained, besides the furniture, about two\n",
      "square feet of walking room, and now this was occupied by a cactus. The\n",
      "bed groaned under crates of pansies, lilies and heliotrope, the lounge was\n",
      "covered with hyacinths and tulips, and the washstand supported a species\n",
      "of young tree warranted to bear flowers at some time or other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clifford came in a little later, fell over a box of sweet peas, swore a\n",
      "little, apologized, and then, as the full splendour of the floral _fête_\n",
      "burst upon him, sat down in astonishment upon a geranium. The geranium was\n",
      "a wreck, but Selby said, \"Don't mind,\" and glared at the cactus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you going to give a ball?\" demanded Clifford.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"N--no,--I'm very fond of flowers,\" said Selby, but the statement lacked\n",
      "enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should imagine so.\" Then, after a silence, \"That's a fine cactus.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Selby contemplated the cactus, touched it with the air of a connoisseur,\n",
      "and pricked his thumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clifford poked a pansy with his stick. Then Joseph came in with the bill,\n",
      "announcing the sum total in a loud voice, partly to impress Clifford,\n",
      "partly to intimidate Selby into disgorging a _pourboire_ which he would\n",
      "share, if he chose, with the gardener. Clifford tried to pretend that he\n",
      "had not heard, while Selby paid bill and tribute without a murmur. Then he\n",
      "lounged back into the room with an attempt at indifference which failed\n",
      "entirely when he tore his trousers on the cactus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clifford made some commonplace remark, lighted a cigarette and looked out\n",
      "of the window to give Selby a chance. Selby tried to take it, but getting\n",
      "as far as--\"Yes, spring is here at last,\" froze solid. He looked at the\n",
      "back of Clifford's head. It expressed volumes. Those little perked-up ears\n",
      "seemed tingling with suppressed glee. He made a desperate effort to master\n",
      "the situation, and jumped up to reach for some Russian cigarettes as an\n",
      "incentive to conversation, but was foiled by the cactus, to whom again he\n",
      "fell a prey. The last straw was added.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Damn the cactus.\" This observation was wrung from Selby against his\n",
      "will,--against his own instinct of self-preservation, but the thorns on\n",
      "the cactus were long and sharp, and at their repeated prick his pent-up\n",
      "wrath escaped. It was too late now; it was done, and Clifford had wheeled\n",
      "around.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See here, Selby, why the deuce did you buy those flowers?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm fond of them,\" said Selby.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you going to do with them? You can't sleep here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could, if you'd help me take the pansies off the bed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where can you put them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't I give them to the concierge?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he said it he regretted it. What in Heaven's name would\n",
      "Clifford think of him! He had heard the amount of the bill. Would he\n",
      "believe that he had invested in these luxuries as a timid declaration to\n",
      "his concierge? And would the Latin Quarter comment upon it in their own\n",
      "brutal fashion? He dreaded ridicule and he knew Clifford's reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then somebody knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selby looked at Clifford with a hunted expression which touched that young\n",
      "man's heart. It was a confession and at the same time a supplication.\n",
      "Clifford jumped up, threaded his way through the floral labyrinth, and\n",
      "putting an eye to the crack of the door, said, \"Who the devil is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This graceful style of reception is indigenous to the Quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's Elliott,\" he said, looking back, \"and Rowden too, and their\n",
      "bulldogs.\" Then he addressed them through the crack.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down on the stairs; Selby and I are coming out directly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Discretion is a virtue. The Latin Quarter possesses few, and discretion\n",
      "seldom figures on the list. They sat down and began to whistle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently Rowden called out, \"I smell flowers. They feast within!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You ought to know Selby better than that,\" growled Clifford behind the\n",
      "door, while the other hurriedly exchanged his torn trousers for others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_We_ know Selby,\" said Elliott with emphasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Rowden, \"he gives receptions with floral decorations and\n",
      "invites Clifford, while we sit on the stairs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, while the youth and beauty of the Quarter revel,\" suggested Rowden;\n",
      "then, with sudden misgiving; \"Is Odette there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See here,\" demanded Elliott, \"is Colette there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he raised his voice in a plaintive howl, \"Are you there, Colette,\n",
      "while I'm kicking my heels on these tiles?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Clifford is capable of anything,\" said Rowden; \"his nature is soured\n",
      "since Rue Barrée sat on him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elliott raised his voice: \"I say, you fellows, we saw some flowers carried\n",
      "into Rue Barrée's house at noon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Posies and roses,\" specified Rowden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Probably for her,\" added Elliott, caressing his bulldog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clifford turned with sudden suspicion upon Selby. The latter hummed a\n",
      "tune, selected a pair of gloves and, choosing a dozen cigarettes, placed\n",
      "them in a case. Then walking over to the cactus, he deliberately detached\n",
      "a blossom, drew it through his buttonhole, and picking up hat and stick,\n",
      "smiled upon Clifford, at which the latter was mightily troubled.\n",
      "\n",

      "Monday morning at Julian's, students fought for places; students with\n",
      "prior claims drove away others who had been anxiously squatting on coveted\n",
      "tabourets since the door was opened in hopes of appropriating them at\n",
      "roll-call; students squabbled over palettes, brushes, portfolios, or rent\n",
      "the air with demands for Ciceri and bread. The former, a dirty ex-model,\n",
      "who had in palmier days posed as Judas, now dispensed stale bread at one\n",
      "sou and made enough to keep himself in cigarettes. Monsieur Julian walked\n",
      "in, smiled a fatherly smile and walked out. His disappearance was followed\n",
      "by the apparition of the clerk, a foxy creature who flitted through the\n",
      "battling hordes in search of prey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three men who had not paid dues were caught and summoned. A fourth was\n",
      "scented, followed, outflanked, his retreat towards the door cut off, and\n",
      "finally captured behind the stove. About that time, the revolution\n",
      "assuming an acute form, howls rose for \"Jules!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jules came, umpired two fights with a sad resignation in his big brown\n",
      "eyes, shook hands with everybody and melted away in the throng, leaving an\n",
      "atmosphere of peace and good-will. The lions sat down with the lambs, the\n",
      "massiers marked the best places for themselves and friends, and, mounting\n",
      "the model stands, opened the roll-calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word was passed, \"They begin with C this week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They did.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Clisson!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Clisson jumped like a flash and marked his name on the floor in chalk\n",

      "Caron galloped away to secure his place. Bang! went an easel. \"_Nom de\n",

      "stern and reproachful:\n",

      "Clifford was not there. He was about three miles away in a direct line and\n",
      "every instant increased the distance. Not that he was walking fast,--on\n",
      "the contrary, he was strolling with that leisurely gait peculiar to\n",
      "himself. Elliott was beside him and two bulldogs covered the rear. Elliott\n",
      "was reading the \"Gil Blas,\" from which he seemed to extract amusement, but\n",
      "deeming boisterous mirth unsuitable to Clifford's state of mind, subdued\n",
      "his amusement to a series of discreet smiles. The latter, moodily aware of\n",
      "this, said nothing, but leading the way into the Luxembourg Gardens\n",
      "installed himself upon a bench by the northern terrace and surveyed the\n",
      "landscape with disfavour. Elliott, according to the Luxembourg\n",
      "regulations, tied the two dogs and then, with an interrogative glance\n",
      "toward his friend, resumed the \"Gil Blas\" and the discreet smiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day was perfect. The sun hung over Notre Dame, setting the city in a\n",

      "terrace and flecked the paths and walks with tracery so blue that Clifford\n",
      "might here have found encouragement for his violent \"impressions\" had he\n",
      "but looked; but as usual in this period of his career, his thoughts were\n",
      "anywhere except in his profession. Around about, the sparrows quarrelled\n",
      "and chattered their courtship songs, the big rosy pigeons sailed from tree\n",
      "to tree, the flies whirled in the sunbeams and the flowers exhaled a\n",
      "thousand perfumes which stirred Clifford with languorous wistfulness.\n",
      "Under this influence he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Elliott, you are a true friend--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You make me ill,\" replied the latter, folding his paper. \"It's just as I\n",
      "thought,--you are tagging after some new petticoat again. And,\" he\n",
      "continued wrathfully, \"if this is what you've kept me away from Julian's\n",
      "for,--if it's to fill me up with the perfections of some little idiot--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not idiot,\" remonstrated Clifford gently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See here,\" cried Elliott, \"have you the nerve to try to tell me that you\n",
      "are in love again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, again and again and again and--by George have you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This,\" observed Clifford sadly, \"is serious.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment Elliott would have laid hands on him, then he laughed from\n",
      "sheer helplessness. \"Oh, go on, go on; let's see, there's Clémence and\n",
      "Marie Tellec and Cosette and Fifine, Colette, Marie Verdier--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All of whom are charming, most charming, but I never was serious--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So help me, Moses,\" said Elliott, solemnly, \"each and every one of those\n",
      "named have separately and in turn torn your heart with anguish and have\n",
      "also made me lose my place at Julian's in this same manner; each and every\n",
      "one, separately and in turn. Do you deny it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What you say may be founded on facts--in a way--but give me the credit of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Until the next came along.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But this,--this is really very different. Elliott, believe me, I am all\n",
      "broken up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there being nothing else to do, Elliott gnashed his teeth and\n",

      "\"It's--it's Rue Barrée.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" observed Elliott, with scorn, \"if you are moping and moaning over\n",
      "_that_ girl,--the girl who has given you and myself every reason to wish\n",
      "that the ground would open and engulf us,--well, go on!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going on,--I don't care; timidity has fled--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, your native timidity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm desperate, Elliott. Am I in love? Never, never did I feel so d--n\n",
      "miserable. I can't sleep; honestly, I'm incapable of eating properly.\"\n",

      "\"Same symptoms noticed in the case of Colette.\"\n",

      "\"Listen, will you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold on a moment, I know the rest by heart. Now let me ask you something.\n",
      "Is it your belief that Rue Barrée is a pure girl?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Clifford, turning red.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you love her,--not as you dangle and tiptoe after every pretty\n",
      "inanity--I mean, do you honestly love her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the other doggedly, \"I would--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold on a moment; would you marry her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Clifford turned scarlet. \"Yes,\" he muttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pleasant news for your family,\" growled Elliott in suppressed fury.\n",
      "\"'Dear father, I have just married a charming grisette whom I'm sure\n",
      "you'll welcome with open arms, in company with her mother, a most\n",
      "estimable and cleanly washlady.' Good heavens! This seems to have gone a\n",
      "little further than the rest. Thank your stars, young man, that my head is\n",
      "level enough for us both. Still, in this case, I have no fear. Rue Barrée\n",
      "sat on your aspirations in a manner unmistakably final.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rue Barrée,\" began Clifford, drawing himself up, but he suddenly ceased,\n",
      "for there where the dappled sunlight glowed in spots of gold, along the\n",
      "sun-flecked path, tripped Rue Barrée. Her gown was spotless, and her big\n",
      "straw hat, tipped a little from the white forehead, threw a shadow across\n",
      "her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elliott stood up and bowed. Clifford removed his head-covering with an air\n",
      "so plaintive, so appealing, so utterly humble that Rue Barrée smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smile was delicious and when Clifford, incapable of sustaining himself\n",
      "on his legs from sheer astonishment, toppled slightly, she smiled again in\n",
      "spite of herself. A few moments later she took a chair on the terrace and\n",
      "drawing a book from her music-roll, turned the pages, found the place, and\n",
      "then placing it open downwards in her lap, sighed a little, smiled a\n",
      "little, and looked out over the city. She had entirely forgotten Foxhall\n",
      "Clifford.\n",
      "\n",

      "fire there over her heart, and like fire it warmed her heart, now\n",
      "fluttering under the silken petals. Rue Barrée sighed again. She was very\n",
      "happy. The sky was so blue, the air so soft and perfumed, the sunshine so\n",
      "caressing, and her heart sang within her, sang to the rose in her breast.\n",

      "where they bowed and strutted and bobbed and turned until Rue Barrée\n",
      "laughed in delight, and looking up beheld Clifford before her. His hat was\n",

      "laugh. Was this Rue Barrée? So changed, so changed that she did not know\n",
      "herself; but oh! that song in her heart which drowned all else, which\n",

      "moment. Then the devil of recklessness seizing him, he sat down and\n",
      "offered himself, soul and body, goods and chattels. And all the time he\n",
      "knew he was a fool and that infatuation is not love, and that each word he\n",
      "uttered bound him in honour from which there was no escape. And all the\n",

      "When Clifford finished, he finished in a glow of excitement, but Rue\n",
      "Barrée's response was long in coming and his ardour cooled while the\n",
      "situation slowly assumed its just proportions. Then regret began to creep\n",
      "in, but he put that aside and broke out again in protestations. At the\n",
      "first word Rue Barrée checked him.\n",

      "fair, in the sunshine of a perfect day. He followed her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" she murmured, \"it is hard,--hard to work always--always alone with\n",

      "the streets, the boulevard--when passion is dead. I know it,--_we_ know\n",
      "it,--we others who have nothing,--have no one, and who give ourselves,\n",
      "unquestioning--when we love,--yes, unquestioning--heart and soul, knowing\n",

      "Rue Barrée acknowledged his solemn salutes. Forty times a day he blessed\n",
      "Rue Barrée for her refusal, and thanked his lucky stars, and at the same\n",
      "time, oh, wondrous heart of ours!--he suffered the tortures of the\n",
      "blighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elliott was annoyed, partly by Clifford's reticence, partly by the\n",

      "big straw hat would pass Clifford and his familiars steering an easterly\n",
      "course to the Café Vachette, and at the respectful uncovering of the band\n",
      "would colour and smile at Clifford, Elliott's slumbering suspicions awoke.\n",
      "But he never found out anything, and finally gave it up as beyond his\n",
      "comprehension, merely qualifying Clifford as an idiot and reserving his\n",
      "opinion of Rue Barrée. And all this time Selby was jealous. At first he\n",
      "refused to acknowledge it to himself, and cut the studio for a day in the\n",
      "country, but the woods and fields of course aggravated his case, and the\n",
      "brooks babbled of Rue Barrée and the mowers calling to each other across\n",
      "the meadow ended in a quavering \"Rue Bar-rée-e!\" That day spent in the\n",
      "country made him angry for a week, and he worked sulkily at Julian's, all\n",
      "the time tormented by a desire to know where Clifford was and what he\n",
      "might be doing. This culminated in an erratic stroll on Sunday which ended\n",
      "at the flower-market on the Pont au Change, began again, was gloomily\n",
      "extended to the morgue, and again ended at the marble bridge. It would\n",
      "never do, and Selby felt it, so he went to see Clifford, who was\n",
      "convalescing on mint juleps in his garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "They sat down together and discussed morals and human happiness, and each\n",
      "found the other most entertaining, only Selby failed to pump Clifford, to\n",
      "the other's unfeigned amusement. But the juleps spread balm on the sting\n",
      "of jealousy, and trickled hope to the blighted, and when Selby said he\n",
      "must go, Clifford went too, and when Selby, not to be outdone, insisted on\n",
      "accompanying Clifford back to his door, Clifford determined to see Selby\n",
      "back half way, and then finding it hard to part, they decided to dine\n",
      "together and \"flit.\" To flit, a verb applied to Clifford's nocturnal\n",
      "prowls, expressed, perhaps, as well as anything, the gaiety proposed.\n",
      "Dinner was ordered at Mignon's, and while Selby interviewed the chef,\n",
      "Clifford kept a fatherly eye on the butler. The dinner was a success, or\n",
      "was of the sort generally termed a success. Toward the dessert Selby heard\n",
      "some one say as at a great distance, \"Kid Selby, drunk as a lord.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A group of men passed near them; it seemed to him that he shook hands and\n",
      "laughed a great deal, and that everybody was very witty. There was\n",
      "Clifford opposite swearing undying confidence in his chum Selby, and there\n",
      "seemed to be others there, either seated beside them or continually\n",
      "passing with the swish of skirts on the polished floor. The perfume of\n",
      "roses, the rustle of fans, the touch of rounded arms and the laughter grew\n",
      "vaguer and vaguer. The room seemed enveloped in mist. Then, all in a\n",
      "moment each object stood out painfully distinct, only forms and visages\n",
      "were distorted and voices piercing. He drew himself up, calm, grave, for\n",
      "the moment master of himself, but very drunk. He knew he was drunk, and\n",
      "was as guarded and alert, as keenly suspicious of himself as he would have\n",
      "been of a thief at his elbow. His self-command enabled Clifford to hold\n",
      "his head safely under some running water, and repair to the street\n",
      "considerably the worse for wear, but never suspecting that his companion\n",
      "was drunk. For a time he kept his self-command. His face was only a bit\n",
      "paler, a bit tighter than usual; he was only a trifle slower and more\n",
      "fastidious in his speech. It was midnight when he left Clifford peacefully\n",
      "slumbering in somebody's arm-chair, with a long suede glove dangling in\n",
      "his hand and a plumy boa twisted about his neck to protect his throat from\n",
      "drafts. He walked through the hall and down the stairs, and found himself\n",
      "on the sidewalk in a quarter he did not know. Mechanically he looked up at\n",
      "the name of the street. The name was not familiar. He turned and steered\n",
      "his course toward some lights clustered at the end of the street. They\n",
      "proved farther away than he had anticipated, and after a long quest he\n",
      "came to the conclusion that his eyes had been mysteriously removed from\n",
      "their proper places and had been reset on either side of his head like\n",
      "those of a bird. It grieved him to think of the inconvenience this\n",
      "transformation might occasion him, and he attempted to cock up his head,\n",
      "hen-like, to test the mobility of his neck. Then an immense despair stole\n",
      "over him,--tears gathered in the tear-ducts, his heart melted, and he\n",
      "collided with a tree. This shocked him into comprehension; he stifled the\n",
      "violent tenderness in his breast, picked up his hat and moved on more\n",
      "briskly. His mouth was white and drawn, his teeth tightly clinched. He\n",
      "held his course pretty well and strayed but little, and after an\n",
      "apparently interminable length of time found himself passing a line of\n",
      "cabs. The brilliant lamps, red, yellow, and green annoyed him, and he felt\n",
      "it might be pleasant to demolish them with his cane, but mastering this\n",
      "impulse he passed on. Later an idea struck him that it would save fatigue\n",
      "to take a cab, and he started back with that intention, but the cabs\n",
      "seemed already so far away and the lanterns were so bright and confusing\n",
      "that he gave it up, and pulling himself together looked around.\n",
      "\n",
      "A shadow, a mass, huge, undefined, rose to his right. He recognized the\n",
      "Arc de Triomphe and gravely shook his cane at it. Its size annoyed him. He\n",
      "felt it was too big. Then he heard something fall clattering to the\n",
      "pavement and thought probably it was his cane but it didn't much matter.\n",
      "When he had mastered himself and regained control of his right leg, which\n",
      "betrayed symptoms of insubordination, he found himself traversing the\n",
      "Place de la Concorde at a pace which threatened to land him at the\n",
      "Madeleine. This would never do. He turned sharply to the right and\n",
      "crossing the bridge passed the Palais Bourbon at a trot and wheeled into\n",
      "the Boulevard St. Germain. He got on well enough although the size of the\n",
      "War Office struck him as a personal insult, and he missed his cane, which\n",
      "it would have been pleasant to drag along the iron railings as he passed.\n",
      "It occurred to him, however, to substitute his hat, but when he found it\n",
      "he forgot what he wanted it for and replaced it upon his head with\n",
      "gravity. Then he was obliged to battle with a violent inclination to sit\n",
      "down and weep. This lasted until he came to the rue de Rennes, but there\n",
      "he became absorbed in contemplating the dragon on the balcony overhanging\n",
      "the Cour du Dragon, and time slipped away until he remembered vaguely that\n",
      "he had no business there, and marched off again. It was slow work. The\n",
      "inclination to sit down and weep had given place to a desire for solitary\n",
      "and deep reflection. Here his right leg forgot its obedience and attacking\n",
      "the left, outflanked it and brought him up against a wooden board which\n",
      "seemed to bar his path. He tried to walk around it, but found the street\n",
      "closed. He tried to push it over, and found he couldn't. Then he noticed a\n",
      "red lantern standing on a pile of paving-stones inside the barrier. This\n",
      "was pleasant. How was he to get home if the boulevard was blocked? But he\n",
      "was not on the boulevard. His treacherous right leg had beguiled him into\n",
      "a detour, for there, behind him lay the boulevard with its endless line of\n",
      "lamps,--and here, what was this narrow dilapidated street piled up with\n",
      "earth and mortar and heaps of stone? He looked up. Written in staring\n",
      "black letters on the barrier was\n",
      "\n",
      "RUE BARRÉE.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down. Two policemen whom he knew came by and advised him to get up,\n",
      "but he argued the question from a standpoint of personal taste, and they\n",
      "passed on, laughing. For he was at that moment absorbed in a problem. It\n",
      "was, how to see Rue Barrée. She was somewhere or other in that big house\n",
      "with the iron balconies, and the door was locked, but what of that? The\n",
      "simple idea struck him to shout until she came. This idea was replaced by\n",
      "another equally lucid,--to hammer on the door until she came; but finally\n",
      "rejecting both of these as too uncertain, he decided to climb into the\n",
      "balcony, and opening a window politely inquire for Rue Barrée. There was\n",
      "but one lighted window in the house that he could see. It was on the\n",
      "second floor, and toward this he cast his eyes. Then mounting the wooden\n",
      "barrier and clambering over the piles of stones, he reached the sidewalk\n",
      "and looked up at the façade for a foothold. It seemed impossible. But a\n",
      "sudden fury seized him, a blind, drunken obstinacy, and the blood rushed\n",
      "to his head, leaping, beating in his ears like the dull thunder of an\n",
      "ocean. He set his teeth, and springing at a window-sill, dragged himself\n",
      "up and hung to the iron bars. Then reason fled; there surged in his brain\n",
      "the sound of many voices, his heart leaped up beating a mad tattoo, and\n",
      "gripping at cornice and ledge he worked his way along the façade, clung to\n",
      "pipes and shutters, and dragged himself up, over and into the balcony by\n",
      "the lighted window. His hat fell off and rolled against the pane. For a\n",
      "moment he leaned breathless against the railing--then the window was\n",
      "slowly opened from within.\n",
      "\n",
      "They stared at each other for some time. Presently the girl took two\n",
      "unsteady steps back into the room. He saw her face,--all crimsoned\n",
      "now,--he saw her sink into a chair by the lamplit table, and without a\n",
      "word he followed her into the room, closing the big door-like panes behind\n",
      "him. Then they looked at each other in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was small and white; everything was white about it,--the\n",
      "curtained bed, the little wash-stand in the corner, the bare walls, the\n",
      "china lamp,--and his own face,--had he known it, but the face and neck of\n",
      "Rue were surging in the colour that dyed the blossoming rose-tree there on\n",
      "the hearth beside her. It did not occur to him to speak. She seemed not to\n",
      "expect it. His mind was struggling with the impressions of the room. The\n",
      "whiteness, the extreme purity of everything occupied him--began to trouble\n",
      "him. As his eye became accustomed to the light, other objects grew from\n",
      "the surroundings and took their places in the circle of lamplight. There\n",
      "was a piano and a coal-scuttle and a little iron trunk and a bath-tub.\n",
      "Then there was a row of wooden pegs against the door, with a white chintz\n",
      "curtain covering the clothes underneath. On the bed lay an umbrella and a\n",
      "big straw hat, and on the table, a music-roll unfurled, an ink-stand, and\n",
      "sheets of ruled paper. Behind him stood a wardrobe faced with a mirror,\n",
      "but somehow he did not care to see his own face just then. He was\n",
      "sobering.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl sat looking at him without a word. Her face was expressionless,\n",
      "yet the lips at times trembled almost imperceptibly. Her eyes, so\n",
      "wonderfully blue in the daylight, seemed dark and soft as velvet, and the\n",
      "colour on her neck deepened and whitened with every breath. She seemed\n",
      "smaller and more slender than when he had seen her in the street, and\n",
      "there was now something in the curve of her cheek almost infantine. When\n",
      "at last he turned and caught his own reflection in the mirror behind him,\n",
      "a shock passed through him as though he had seen a shameful thing, and his\n",
      "clouded mind and his clouded thoughts grew clearer. For a moment their\n",
      "eyes met then his sought the floor, his lips tightened, and the struggle\n",
      "within him bowed his head and strained every nerve to the breaking. And\n",
      "now it was over, for the voice within had spoken. He listened, dully\n",
      "interested but already knowing the end,--indeed it little mattered;--the\n",
      "end would always be the same for him;--he understood now--always the same\n",
      "for him, and he listened, dully interested, to a voice which grew within\n",
      "him. After a while he stood up, and she rose at once, one small hand\n",
      "resting on the table. Presently he opened the window, picked up his hat,\n",
      "and shut it again. Then he went over to the rosebush and touched the\n",
      "blossoms with his face. One was standing in a glass of water on the table\n",
      "and mechanically the girl drew it out, pressed it with her lips and laid\n",
      "it on the table beside him. He took it without a word and crossing the\n",
      "room, opened the door. The landing was dark and silent, but the girl\n",
      "lifted the lamp and gliding past him slipped down the polished stairs to\n",
      "the hallway. Then unchaining the bolts, she drew open the iron wicket.\n",

      "It took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp\n",

      "\n",
      "It was called, she said, \"The Esoteric Order of Dagon,\" and was\n",
      "undoubtedly a debased, quasi-pagan thing imported from the East a\n",

      "barren. Its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view\n",

      "Shortly before ten the next morning I stood with my one small valise\n",

      "the Innsmouth bus. In a few moments a small motor-coach of extreme\n",
      "decrepitude and dirty gray color rattled down State Street, made a\n",
      "turn, and drew up at the curb beside me. I felt immediately that\n",
      "it was the right one; a guess which the half-illegible sign on the\n",
      "windshield--\"_Arkham-Innsmouth-Newb'port_\"--soon verified.\n",

      "furtive fashion. The driver also alighted. This, I reflected, must be\n",
      "the Joe Sargent mentioned by the ticket-agent; and even before I had\n",
      "noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion\n",
      "which could be neither checked nor explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a thin, stoop-shouldered man not much under six feet tall,\n",
      "dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed gray golf\n",
      "cap. His age was perhaps thirty-five, but the odd, deep creases in the\n",
      "sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull,\n",
      "expressionless face. He had a narrow head, bulging, watery blue eyes\n",
      "that seemed never to wink, a flat nose, a receding forehead and chin,\n",
      "and singularly undeveloped ears. As he walked toward the bus I observed\n",
      "his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately\n",
      "immense. The more I studied them the more I wondered how he could buy\n",
      "any shoes to fit them.\n",
      "\n",
      "A certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike. He was\n",
      "evidently given to working or lounging around the fish docks, and\n",

      "blood was in him I could not even guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was sorry when I saw that there would be no other passengers on the\n",
      "bus. Somehow I did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver.\n",
      "But as the leaving time obviously approached I conquered my qualms and\n",

      "single word \"Innsmouth.\"\n",

      "At length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk, and rattled noisily\n",
      "past the old brick buildings of State Street amidst a cloud of vapor\n",
      "from the exhaust.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day was warm and sunny, but the landscape of sand, sedge-grass,\n",
      "and stunted shrubbery became more and more desolate as we proceeded.\n",
      "Out the window I could see the blue water and the sandy line of Plum\n",
      "Island, and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road\n",
      "veered off from the main highway to Rowley and Ipswich.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last we lost sight of Plum Island and saw the vast expanse of the\n",
      "open Atlantic on our left. Our narrow course began to climb steeply,\n",
      "and I felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest\n",
      "ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky. It was as if the bus were\n",
      "about to keep on its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and\n",
      "merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky. The\n",
      "smell of the sea took on ominous implications, and the silent driver's\n",
      "bent, rigid back and narrow head became more and more hateful. As I\n",
      "looked at him I saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless\n",
      "as his face, having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a gray\n",
      "scabrous surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond,\n",
      "where the Manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs\n",
      "that culminate in Kingsport Head; all my attention was captured by the\n",
      "nearer panorama just below me. I had, I realized, come face to face\n",
      "with rumor-shadowed Innsmouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a town of wide extent and dense construction, yet one with a\n",
      "portentous dearth of visible life. The vast huddle of sagging gambrel\n",
      "roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea\n",
      "of wormy decay, and as we approached along the now descending road I\n",
      "could see that many roofs had wholly caved in. Stretching inland I saw\n",
      "the rusted, grass-grown line of the abandoned railway, with leaning\n",
      "telegraph-poles now devoid of wires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end\n",
      "in indeterminate rottenness, those farthest south seeming the most\n",
      "decayed. And far out at sea, despite a high tide, I glimpsed a long,\n",
      "black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of\n",
      "odd latent malignancy. This, I knew, must be Devil Reef. As I looked,\n",
      "a subtle, curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim\n",
      "repulsion; and oddly enough, I found this overtone more disturbing than\n",
      "the primary impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the bus reached a lower level I began to catch the steady note of\n",
      "a waterfall through the unnatural stillness. The leaning, unpainted\n",
      "houses grew thicker, lined both sides of the road, and displayed more\n",
      "urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind. The panorama\n",
      "ahead had contracted to a street scene, and in spots I could see\n",
      "where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had\n",
      "formerly existed. All the houses were apparently deserted, and there\n",
      "were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told\n",
      "of buildings that had collapsed. Pervading everything was the most\n",
      "nauseous fishy odor imaginable.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I was not to reach my destination without one other very strong\n",
      "impression of poignantly disagreeable quality. The bus had come to a\n",
      "sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and\n",
      "the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the center, and I was\n",
      "looking at a large pillared hall on the right-hand junction ahead. The\n",
      "structure's once white paint was now gray and peeling, and the black\n",
      "and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that I could only with\n",
      "difficulty make out the words \"Esoteric Order of Dagon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of the church basement was open, revealing a rectangle of\n",
      "blackness inside. And as I looked, a certain object crossed or seemed\n",
      "to cross that dark rectangle; burning into my brain a momentary\n",
      "conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because\n",
      "analysis could not show a single nightmarish quality in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a living object--the first except the driver that I had seen\n",
      "since entering the compact part of the town--and had I been in a\n",
      "steadier mood I would have found nothing whatever of terror in it.\n",
      "Clearly, as I realized a moment later, it was the pastor; clad in\n",
      "some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the Order of Dagon\n",
      "had modified the ritual of the local churches. The thing which had\n",
      "probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of\n",
      "bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore; an almost exact duplicate\n",
      "of the one Miss Tilton had shown me the previous evening. This, acting\n",
      "on my imagination, had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the\n",
      "indeterminate face and robed, shambling form beneath it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very thin sprinkling of repellent-looking youngish people now became\n",
      "visible on the sidewalks--lone individuals, and silent knots of two\n",
      "or three. The lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harbored\n",
      "small shops with dingy signs, and I noticed a parked truck or two as we\n",

      "For some reason or other I chose to make my first inquiries at\n",

      "Innsmouth. I found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge, and was\n",
      "pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful\n",

      "were disgusting. It was awful to hear them chanting in their churches\n",
      "at night, and especially during their main festivals or revivals, which\n",
      "fell twice a year on April 30 and October 31.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were very fond of the water, and swam a great deal in both river\n",

      "if afraid of something, and when sober could not be persuaded to talk\n",
      "at all with strangers. He was, however, unable to resist any offer of\n",

      "Nobody ever believed him, but the natives did not like him to drink\n",
      "and talk with any strangers; and it was not always safe to be seen\n",

      "I saw that my windows commanded only a sheer three-story drop to the\n",
      "cobbled courtyard. On the right and left, however, some ancient brick\n",
      "business blocks abutted on the hotel; their slant roofs coming up to a\n",
      "reasonable jumping distance from my fourth-story level. To reach either\n",
      "of these lines of buildings I would have to be in a room two doors\n",
      "from my own--in one case on the north and in the other case on the\n",
      "south--and my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances I had\n",
      "of making the transfer.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I reinforced my own outer door by pushing the bureau against\n",
      "it--little by little, in order to make a minimum of sound. Then,\n",
      "gathering from the grocery boy's map that the best route out of town\n",
      "was southward, I glanced first at the connecting door on the south\n",
      "side of the room. It was designed to open in my direction, hence I\n",
      "saw--after drawing the bolt and finding other fastenings in place--it\n",
      "was not a favorable one for forcing. Accordingly abandoning it as a\n",
      "route, I cautiously moved the bedstead against it to hamper any attack\n",
      "which might be made on it later from the next room. The door on the\n",
      "north was hung to open away from me, and this--though a test proved\n",
      "it to be locked or bolted from the other side--I knew must be my\n",
      "route. If I could gain the roofs of the buildings in Paine Street and\n",
      "descend successfully to the ground level, I might perhaps dart through\n",
      "the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite buildings to Washington\n",
      "or Bates--or else emerge in Paine and edge around southward into\n",
      "Washington. In any case, I would aim to strike Washington somehow and\n",
      "get quickly out of the Town Square region. My preference would be to\n",
      "avoid Paine, since the fire station there might be open all night.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was irresolutely speculating on when I had better attack the\n",
      "northward door, and on how I could least audibly manage it, when I\n",
      "noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and\n",
      "heavier creaking of the stairs. A wavering flicker of light showed\n",
      "through my transom, and the boards of the corridor began to groan with\n",
      "a ponderous load. Muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached,\n",
      "and at length a firm knock came at my outer door.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment I simply held my breath and waited. Eternities\n",
      "seemed to elapse, and the nauseous fishy odor of my environment\n",
      "seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly. Then the knocking was\n",
      "repeated--continuously, and with growing insistence. I knew that the\n",
      "time for action had come, and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward\n",
      "connecting door, bracing myself for the task of battering it open. The\n",
      "knocking waxed louder, and I hoped that its volume would cover the\n",
      "sound of my efforts. At last beginning my attempt, I lunged again and\n",
      "again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder, heedless of shock or\n",
      "pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally the connecting door gave, but with such a crash that I knew\n",
      "those outside must have heard. Instantly the outside knocking became\n",
      "a violent battering, while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors\n",
      "of the rooms on both sides of me. Rushing through the newly opened\n",
      "connection, I succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the\n",
      "lock could be turned; but even as I did so I heard the hall door of the\n",
      "third room--the one from whose window I had hoped to reach the roof\n",
      "below--being tried with a pass key.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an instant I felt absolute despair, since my trapping in a chamber\n",
      "with no window egress seemed complete. Then, with a dazed automatism,\n",
      "I made for the next connecting door and performed the blind motion of\n",
      "pushing at it in an effort to get through!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprieve--for the connecting door\n",
      "before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar. In a second I was\n",
      "through, and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which\n",
      "was visibly opening inward. My pressure took the opener off guard, for\n",
      "the thing shut as I pushed, so that I could slip the well-conditioned\n",
      "bolt as I had done with the other door. As I gained this respite I\n",
      "heard the battering at the two other doors abate, while a confused\n",
      "clatter came from the connecting door I had shielded with the bedstead.\n",
      "Evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and\n",
      "were massing in a lateral attack. But at the same moment a pass key\n",
      "sounded in the next door to the north, and I knew that a nearer peril\n",
      "was at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The northward connecting door was wide open, but there was no time to\n",
      "think about checking the already turning lock in the hall. All I could\n",
      "do was to shut and bolt the open connecting door, as well as its mate\n",
      "on the opposite side--pushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau\n",
      "against the other, and moving a washstand in front of the hall door.\n",
      "I must, I saw, trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till I\n",
      "could get out the window and on the roof of the Paine Street block. But\n",
      "even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the\n",
      "immediate weakness of my defenses. I was shuddering because not one\n",
      "of my pursuers, despite some hideous pantings, gruntings, and subdued\n",
      "barkings at odd intervals, was uttering an intelligible vocal sound!\n",
      "\n",
      "As I moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows I heard a\n",
      "frightful scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of me, and\n",
      "perceived that the southward battering had ceased. Plainly, most of my\n",
      "opponents were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door\n",
      "which they knew must open directly on me. Outside, the moon played on\n",
      "the ridge-pole of the block below, and I saw that the jump would be\n",
      "desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which I must land.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clatter at the northerly connecting door was now terrific, and\n",
      "I saw that the weak panelling was beginning to splinter. Obviously,\n",
      "the besiegers had brought some ponderous object into play as a\n",
      "battering-ram. The bedstead, however, still held firm; so that I had at\n",
      "least a faint chance of making good my escape. As I opened the window\n",
      "I noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from\n",
      "a pole by brass rings, and also that there was a large projecting\n",
      "catch for the shutters on the exterior. Seeing a possible means of\n",
      "avoiding the dangerous jump, I yanked at the hangings and brought\n",
      "them down, pole and all; then quickly hooking two of the rings in the\n",
      "shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside. The heavy folds reached\n",
      "fully to the abutting roof, and I saw that the rings and catch would\n",
      "be likely to bear my weight. So, climbing out of the window and down\n",
      "the improvised rope ladder, I left behind me forever the morbid and\n",
      "horror-infested fabric of the Gilman House.\n",
      "\n",
      "I landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof, and succeeded in\n",
      "gaining the gaping black skylight without a slip. The place inside was\n",
      "ghoulish-looking, but I was past minding such impressions and made at\n",
      "once for the staircase revealed by my flashlight--after a hasty glance\n",
      "at my watch, which showed the hour to be 2 A.M. The steps creaked, but\n",
      "seemed tolerably sound; and I raced down past a barnlike second story\n",
      "to the ground floor. The desolation was complete, and only echoes\n",
      "answered my footfalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hallway inside was black, and when I reached the opposite end I saw\n",
      "that the street door was wedged immovably shut. Resolved to try another\n",
      "building, I groped my way toward the courtyard, but stopped short when\n",
      "close to the doorway.\n",
      "\n",
      "For out of an opened door in the Gilman House a large crowd of doubtful\n",
      "shapes was pouring--lanterns bobbing in the darkness, and horrible\n",
      "croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not English.\n",
      "Their features were indistinguishable, but their crouching, shambling\n",
      "gait was abominably repellent. And worst of all, I perceived that one\n",
      "figure was strangely robed, and unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara\n",
      "of a design altogether too familiar. Again groping toward the street,\n",
      "I opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely\n",
      "shuttered but sashless windows. Fumbling in the rays of my flashlight,\n",
      "I found I could open the shutters; and in another moment had climbed\n",
      "outside and was carefully closing the aperture in its original manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "I walked rapidly, softly, and close to the ruined houses. At Bates\n",
      "Street I drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures\n",
      "crossed in front of me, but was soon on my way again and approaching\n",
      "the open space where Eliot Street obliquely crosses Washington at the\n",
      "intersection of South. Though I had never seen this space, it had\n",
      "looked dangerous to me on the grocery youth's map; since the moonlight\n",
      "would have free play there. There was no use trying to evade it, for\n",
      "any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous\n",
      "visibility and delaying effect. The only thing to do was to cross it\n",
      "boldly and openly; imitating the typical shamble of the Innsmouth folk\n",
      "as best I could, and trusting that no one--or at least no pursuer of\n",
      "mine--would be there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just how fully the pursuit was organized--and indeed, just what its\n",
      "purpose might be--I could form no idea. There seemed to be unusual\n",
      "activity in the town, but I judged that the news of my escape from\n",
      "the Gilman had not yet spread. The open space was, as I had expected,\n",
      "strongly moonlit. But my progress was unimpeded, and no fresh sound\n",
      "arose to hint that I had been spied. Glancing about me, I involuntarily\n",
      "let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea,\n",
      "gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the street's end. Far out beyond\n",
      "the breakwater was the dim, dark line of Devil Reef.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, without warning, I saw the intermittent flashes of light on the\n",
      "distant reef. My muscles tightened for panic flight, held in only by a\n",
      "certain unconscious caution and half-hypnotic fascination. And to make\n",
      "matters worse, there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the\n",
      "Gilman House, which loomed up to the northeast behind me, a series of\n",
      "analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be nothing less\n",
      "than an answering signal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now bent to the left around the ruinous green; still gazing toward\n",
      "the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight, and watching\n",
      "the cryptical flashing of those nameless, unexplainable beacons.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon\n",
      "me--the impression which destroyed my last vestige of self-control and\n",
      "sent me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways\n",
      "and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street. For at\n",
      "a closer glance I saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and\n",
      "the shore were far from empty. They were alive with a teeming horde of\n",
      "shapes swimming inward toward the town!\n",
      "\n",
      "My frantic running ceased before I had covered a block, for at my left\n",
      "I began to hear something like the hue and cry of organized pursuit.\n",
      "There were footsteps and guttural sounds, and a rattling motor wheezed\n",
      "south along Federal Street. In a second all my plans were utterly\n",
      "changed--for if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me, I must\n",
      "clearly find another egress from Innsmouth. I paused and drew into a\n",
      "gaping doorway, reflecting how lucky I was to have left the moonlit\n",
      "open space before these pursuers came down the parallel street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I thought of the abandoned railway to Rowley, whose solid line of\n",
      "ballasted, weed-grown earth still stretched off to the northwest from\n",
      "the crumbling station on the edge of the river gorge. There was just a\n",
      "chance that the townsfolk would not think of that!\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter, I once more consulted\n",
      "the grocery boy's map with the aid of the flashlight. The immediate\n",
      "problem was how to reach the ancient railway; and I now saw that the\n",
      "safest course was ahead to Babson Street, then west to Lafayette--there\n",
      "edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one\n",
      "I had traversed--and subsequently back northward and westward in\n",
      "zigzagging line through Lafayette, Bates, Adams, and Banks Streets--the\n",
      "latter skirting the river gorge--to the abandoned and dilapidated\n",
      "station I had seen from my window. My reason for going ahead to Babson\n",
      "was that I wished neither to re-cross the earlier open space nor to\n",
      "begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as South. I\n",
      "crossed the street to the right-hand side in order to edge around into\n",
      "Babson as inconspicuously as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Babson Street I clung as closely as possible to the sagging,\n",
      "uneven buildings; twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me\n",
      "momentarily increased. The open space ahead shone wide and desolate\n",
      "under the moon, but my route would not force me to cross it. During\n",
      "my second pause I began to detect a fresh distribution of the vague\n",
      "sounds; and upon looking cautiously out from cover beheld a motor car\n",
      "darting across the open space, bound outward along Eliot Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I watched--choked by a sudden rise in the fishy odor after a short\n",
      "abatement--I saw a band of uncouth, crouching shapes loping and\n",
      "shambling in the same direction; and knew that this must be the party\n",
      "guarding the Ipswich road, since that highway forms an extension of\n",
      "Eliot Street. Two of the figures I glimpsed were in voluminous robes,\n",
      "and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight.\n",
      "The gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through me--for\n",
      "it seemed to me the creature was almost _hopping_.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the last of the band was out of sight I resumed my progress;\n",
      "darting around the corner into Lafayette Street, and crossing Eliot\n",
      "very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still advancing along\n",
      "that thoroughfare. I did hear some croaking and clattering sounds\n",
      "far off toward Town Square, but accomplished the passage without\n",
      "disaster. My greatest dread was in re-crossing broad and moonlit South\n",
      "Street--with its seaward view--and I had to nerve myself for the\n",
      "ordeal. Someone might easily be looking, and possible Eliot Street\n",
      "stragglers could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points. At\n",
      "the last moment I decided I had better slacken my trot and make the\n",
      "crossing as before in the shambling gait of an average Innsmouth native.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had not quite crossed the street when I heard a muttering band\n",
      "advancing along Washington from the north. As they reached the broad\n",
      "open space where I had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit\n",
      "water I could see them plainly only a block away--and was horrified by\n",
      "the bestial abnormality of their faces and the dog-like sub-humanness\n",
      "of their crouching gait. One man moved in a positively simian way, with\n",
      "long arms frequently touching the ground; while another figure--robed\n",
      "and tiaraed--seemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion. I judged\n",
      "this party to be the one I had seen in the Gilman's courtyard--the one,\n",
      "therefore, most closely on my trail. As some of the figures turned\n",
      "to look in my direction I was transfixed with fright, yet managed to\n",
      "preserve the casual, shambling gait I had assumed. To this day I do\n",
      "not know whether they saw me or not. If they did, my stratagem must\n",
      "have deceived them, for they passed on across the moonlit space without\n",
      "varying their course--meanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful\n",
      "guttural patois I could not identify.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more in shadow, I resumed my former dog-trot past the leaning and\n",
      "decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night. Having crossed to\n",
      "the western sidewalk I rounded the nearest corner into Bates Street,\n",
      "where I kept close to the buildings on the southern side. At last I saw\n",
      "the ancient arcaded station--or what was left of it--and made directly\n",
      "for the tracks that started from its farther end.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rails were rusty but mainly intact, and not more than half the\n",
      "ties had rotted away. Walking or running on such a surface was very\n",
      "difficult; but I did my best, and on the whole made very fair time. For\n",
      "some distance the line kept on along the gorge's brink, but at length I\n",
      "reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy\n",
      "height. The condition of this bridge would determine my next step. If\n",
      "humanly possible, I would use it; if not, I would have to risk more\n",
      "street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vast, barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the\n",
      "moonlight and I saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet\n",
      "within. Entering, I began to use my flashlight, and was almost knocked\n",
      "down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me. About halfway across\n",
      "there was a perilous gap in the ties which I feared for a moment would\n",
      "halt me; but in the end I risked a desperate jump which fortunately\n",
      "succeeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was glad to see the moonlight again when I emerged from that macabre\n",
      "tunnel. The old tracks crossed River Street at a grade, and at once\n",
      "veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of\n",
      "Innsmouth's abhorrent fishy odor. Here the dense growth of weeds and\n",
      "briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes, but I was none the less\n",
      "glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril. I\n",
      "knew that much of my route must be visible from the Rowley road.\n",
      "\n",
      "The marshy region began very shortly, with the single track on a low,\n",
      "grassy embankment. Then came a sort of island of higher ground, where\n",
      "the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and\n",
      "brambles. I was very glad of this partial shelter, since at this point\n",
      "the Rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just before entering the cut I glanced behind me, but saw no pursuer.\n",
      "The ancient spires and roofs of decaying Innsmouth gleamed lovely and\n",
      "ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight, and I thought of how they must\n",
      "have looked in the old days before the shadow fell. Then, as my gaze\n",
      "circled inland from the town, something less tranquil arrested my\n",
      "notice and held me immobile for a second.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I saw--or fancied I saw--was a disturbing suggestion of undulant\n",
      "motion far to the south; a suggestion which made me conclude that\n",
      "a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level\n",
      "Ipswich road. The distance was great, and I could distinguish nothing\n",
      "in detail; but I did not at all like the look of that moving column.\n",
      "\n",
      "All sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind. I thought of those\n",
      "very extreme Innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling, centuried\n",
      "warrens near the waterfront. I thought, too, of those nameless swimmers\n",
      "I had seen. Counting the parties so far glimpsed, as well as those\n",
      "presumably covering other roads, the number of my pursuers must be\n",
      "strangely large for a town as depopulated as Innsmouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who were they? Why were they here? And if such a column of them was\n",
      "scouring the Ipswich road, would the patrols on the other roads be\n",
      "likewise augmented?\n",
      "\n",
      "I had entered the brush-grown cut and was struggling along at a very\n",
      "slow pace when that damnable fishy odor again waxed dominant. There\n",
      "were sounds, too--a kind of wholesale, colossal flopping or pattering\n",
      "which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then both stench and sounds grew stronger, so that I paused\n",
      "shivering and grateful for the cut's protection. It was here, I\n",
      "recalled, that the Rowley road drew so close to the old railway before\n",
      "crossing westward and diverging. Something was coming along that road,\n",
      "and I must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance.\n",
      "Crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft I felt reasonably safe, even\n",
      "though I knew the searchers would have to cross the track in front of\n",
      "me not much more than a hundred yards away. I would be able to see\n",
      "them, but they could not, except by a malign miracle, see me.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once I began dreading to look at them as they passed. I saw the\n",
      "close moonlit space where they would surge by, and had curious thoughts\n",
      "about the irredeemable pollution of that space. They would perhaps\n",
      "be the worst of all Innsmouth types--something one would not care to\n",
      "remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stench waxed overpowering, and the noises swelled to a bestial\n",
      "babel of croaking, baying, and barking, without the least suggestion\n",
      "of human speech. Were these indeed the voices of my pursuers? That\n",
      "flopping or pattering was monstrous--I could not look upon the\n",
      "degenerate creatures responsible for it. I would keep my eyes shut till\n",
      "the sounds receded toward the west. The horde was very close now--the\n",
      "air foul with their hoarse snarlings, and the ground almost shaking\n",
      "with their alien-rhythmed footfalls. My breath nearly ceased to come,\n",
      "and I put every ounce of will-power into the task of holding my eyelids\n",
      "down.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous\n",

      "Orne, just after the Civil War; since the ancestry of the bride was\n",

      "Marsh--among the known families of New Hampshire. Possibly,\n",
      "many suggested, she was the natural daughter of some Marsh of\n",
      "prominence--she certainly had the true Marsh eyes. Most of the\n",
      "puzzling was done after her early death, which took place at the birth\n",
      "of my grandmother--her only child. Having formed some disagreeable\n",
      "impressions connected with the name of Marsh, I did not welcome the\n",

      "studies and other wholesome activities--reminded of the bygone terror\n",
      "only by occasional official visits from government men in connection\n",
      "with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started. Around the\n",
      "middle of July--just a year after the Innsmouth experience--I spent a\n",
      "week with my late mother's family in Cleveland; checking some of my\n",

      "connected chart I could construct.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not exactly relish this task, for the atmosphere of the\n",

      "parents as a child, although she always welcomed her father when\n",
      "he came to Toledo. My Arkham-born grandmother had seemed strange\n",
      "and almost terrifying to me, and I do not think I grieved when she\n",
      "disappeared. I was eight years old then, and it was said that she had\n",
      "wandered off in grief after the suicide of my uncle Douglas, her eldest\n",

      "\n",
      "This uncle had resembled her, and I had never liked him either.\n",
      "Something about the staring, unwinking expression of both of them\n",

      "Walter had not looked like that. They were like their father, though\n",
      "poor little cousin Lawrence--Walter's son--had been an almost perfect\n",
      "duplicate of his grandmother before his condition took him to the\n",
      "permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at Canton. I had not seen him in\n",
      "four years, but my uncle once implied that his state, both mental and\n",
      "physical, was very bad. This worry had probably been a major cause of\n",
      "his mother's death two years before.\n",
      "\n",
      "My grandfather and his widowered son Walter now comprised the Cleveland\n",
      "household, but the memory of older times hung thickly over it. I still\n",
      "disliked the place, and tried to get my researches done as quickly as\n",
      "possible. Williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance\n",
      "by my grandfather; though for Orne material I had to depend on my uncle\n",
      "Walter, who put at my disposal the contents of all his files, including\n",
      "notes, letters, cuttings, heirlooms, photographs, and miniatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in going over the letters and pictures on the Orne side that I\n",
      "began to acquire a kind of terror of my own ancestry. As I have said,\n",
      "my grandmother and uncle Douglas had always disturbed me. Now, years\n",
      "after their passing, I gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably\n",
      "heightened feeling of repulsion and alienation. I could not at first\n",
      "understand the change, but gradually a horrible sort of _comparison_\n",
      "began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the steady\n",
      "refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it.\n",
      "It was clear that the typical expression of these faces now suggested\n",
      "something it had not suggested before--something which would bring\n",
      "stark panic if too openly thought of.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the worst shock came when my uncle showed me the Orne jewelry in\n",
      "a downtown safe-deposit vault. Some of the items were delicate and\n",
      "inspiring enough, but there was one box of strange old pieces descended\n",
      "from my mysterious great-grandmother which my uncle was almost\n",
      "reluctant to produce. They were, he said, of very grotesque and almost\n",
      "repulsive design.\n",
      "\n",
      "As my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things, he urged\n",
      "me not to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of\n",
      "the designs. There were two armlets, a tiara, and a kind of pectoral;\n",
      "the latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable\n",
      "extravagance.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed to expect some demonstration when the first piece--the\n",
      "tiara--became visible, but I doubt if he expected quite what actually\n",
      "happened. I did not expect it, either, for I thought I was thoroughly\n",
      "forewarned regarding what the jewelry would turn out to be. What I did\n",
      "was to faint silently away just as I had done in that brier-choked\n",
      "railway cut a year before.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that day on my life has been a nightmare of brooding and\n",
      "apprehension, nor do I know how much is hideous truth and how much\n",
      "madness. My great-grandmother had been a Marsh of unknown source whose\n",
      "husband lived in Arkham--and did not old Zadok say that the daughter of\n",
      "Obed Marsh by a monstrous mother was married to an Arkham man through\n",
      "a trick? What was it the ancient toper had muttered about the likeness\n",
      "of my eyes to Captain Obed's? In Arkham, too, the curator had told me I\n",
      "had the true Marsh eyes. Was Obed Marsh my own great-great-grandfather?\n",
      "Who--or _what_--then, was my great-great-grandmother? But perhaps\n",
      "this was all madness. Those whitish-gold ornaments might easily\n",
      "have been bought from some Innsmouth sailor by the father of my\n",
      "great-grandmother, whoever he was. And that look in the staring-eyed\n",
      "faces of my grandmother and self-slain uncle might be sheer fancy,\n",
      "bolstered up by the Innsmouth shadow which had so darkly colored my\n",
      "imagination. But why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral\n",
      "quest in New England?\n",
      "\n",
      "For more than two years I fought off these reflections with partial\n",
      "success. My father secured me a place in an insurance office, and\n",
      "I buried myself in routine as deeply as possible. In the winter of\n",
      "1930-31, however, the dreams began. They were very sparse and insidious\n",
      "at first, but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went\n",
      "by. Great watery spaces opened out before me, and I seemed to wander\n",
      "through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls\n",
      "and grotesque fishes as my companions. Then the _other shapes_ began to\n",
      "appear, filling me with nameless horror the moment I awoke. But during\n",
      "the dreams they did not horrify me at all--I was one with them; wearing\n",
      "their unhuman trappings, treading their aqueous ways, and praying\n",
      "monstrously at their evil sea-bottom temples.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was much more than I could remember, but even what I did remember\n",
      "each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if\n",
      "ever I dared write it down. Some frightful influence, I felt, was\n",
      "seeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life\n",
      "into unnameable abysses of blackness and alienage; and the process\n",
      "told heavily on me. My health and appearance grew steadily worse, till\n",
      "finally I was forced to give up my position and adopt the static,\n",
      "secluded life of an invalid. Some odd nervous affliction had me in its\n",
      "grip, and I found myself at times almost unable to shut my eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then that I began to study the mirror with mounting alarm. The\n",
      "slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch, but in my case there\n",
      "was something subtler and more puzzling in the background. My father\n",
      "seemed to notice it, too, for he began looking at me curiously and\n",
      "almost affrightedly. What was taking place in me? Could it be that I\n",
      "was coming to resemble my grandmother and uncle Douglas?\n",
      "\n",
      "One night I had a frightful dream in which I met my grandmother\n",
      "under the sea. She lived in a phosphorescent palace of many\n",
      "terraces, with gardens of strange leprous corals and grotesque\n",
      "brachiate efflorescences, and welcomed me with a warmth that may\n",
      "have been sardonic. She had changed--as those who take to the water\n",
      "change--and told me she had never died. Instead, she had gone to a\n",
      "spot her dead son had learned about, and had leaped to a realm whose\n",
      "wonders--destined for him as well--he had spurned with a smoking\n",
      "pistol. This was to be my realm, too--I could not escape it. I would\n",

      "back after Obed Marsh was dead. Y'ha-nthlei was not destroyed when\n",

      "destroyed. The Deep Ones could never be destroyed, even though the\n",

      "For the present they would rest; but some day, if they remembered, they\n",

      "city greater than Innsmouth next time. They had planned to spread, and\n",
      "had brought up that which would help them, but now they must wait once\n",
      "more. For bringing the upper-earth men's death I must do a penance,\n",
      "but that would not be heavy. This was the dream in which I saw a\n",
      "_shoggoth_ for the first time, and the sight set me awake in a frenzy\n",

      "things in sleep, and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror.\n",
      "I do not believe I need to wait for the full change as most have\n",

      "Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was\n",
      "never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;\n",
      "backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow\n",
      "lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste,\n",
      "something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which\n",
      "never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these\n",
      "silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in\n",
      "the acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he\n",
      "was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the\n",
      "theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had\n",
      "an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with\n",
      "envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and\n",
      "in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to\n",
      "Cain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the\n",
      "devil in his own way.” In this character, it was frequently his fortune\n",
      "to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in\n",
      "the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came\n",
      "about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative\n",
      "at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar\n",
      "catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept\n",
      "his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that\n",
      "was the lawyer’s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those\n",
      "whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the\n",
      "growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt\n",
      "the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman,\n",
      "the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what\n",
      "these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in\n",
      "common. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday\n",
      "walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail\n",
      "with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two\n",
      "men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief\n",
      "jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but\n",
      "even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them\n",
      "uninterrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a\n",
      "by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is\n",
      "called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The\n",
      "inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to\n",
      "do better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in\n",
      "coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an\n",
      "air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday,\n",
      "when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of\n",
      "passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood,\n",
      "like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters,\n",
      "well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note,\n",
      "instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was\n",
      "broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain\n",
      "sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It\n",
      "was two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower\n",
      "storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore\n",
      "in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The\n",
      "door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered\n",
      "and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on\n",
      "the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried\n",
      "his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had\n",
      "appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their\n",
      "ravages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but\n",
      "when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and\n",
      "pointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you ever remark that door?” he asked; and when his companion had\n",
      "replied in the affirmative, “It is connected in my mind,” added he,\n",
      "“with a very odd story.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed?” said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, “and what\n",
      "was that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it was this way,” returned Mr. Enfield: “I was coming home from\n",
      "some place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a black\n",
      "winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was\n",
      "literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the\n",
      "folks asleep—street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession\n",
      "and all as empty as a church—till at last I got into that state of mind\n",
      "when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a\n",
      "policeman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was\n",
      "stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe\n",
      "eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross\n",
      "street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the\n",
      "corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man\n",
      "trampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming on the\n",
      "ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn’t\n",
      "like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,\n",
      "took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where\n",
      "there was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was\n",
      "perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly\n",
      "that it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had\n",
      "turned out were the girl’s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for\n",
      "whom she had been sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not\n",
      "much the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there\n",
      "you might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one\n",
      "curious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first\n",
      "sight. So had the child’s family, which was only natural. But the\n",
      "doctor’s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry\n",
      "apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh\n",
      "accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the\n",
      "rest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones\n",
      "turn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his\n",
      "mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the\n",
      "question, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make\n",
      "such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end\n",
      "of London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we\n",
      "undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were\n",
      "pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we\n",
      "could for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such\n",
      "hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of\n",
      "black sneering coolness—frightened too, I could see that—but carrying\n",
      "it off, sir, really like Satan. ‘If you choose to make capital out of\n",
      "this accident,’ said he, ‘I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but\n",
      "wishes to avoid a scene,’ says he. ‘Name your figure.’ Well, we screwed\n",
      "him up to a hundred pounds for the child’s family; he would have\n",
      "clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us\n",
      "that meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get\n",
      "the money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with\n",
      "the door?—whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the\n",
      "matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts’s,\n",
      "drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can’t mention,\n",
      "though it’s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least\n",
      "very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the\n",
      "signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took\n",
      "the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business\n",
      "looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a\n",
      "cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man’s\n",
      "cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and\n",
      "sneering. ‘Set your mind at rest,’ says he, ‘I will stay with you till\n",
      "the banks open and cash the cheque myself.’ So we all set off, the\n",
      "doctor, and the child’s father, and our friend and myself, and passed\n",
      "the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had\n",
      "breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself,\n",
      "and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of\n",
      "it. The cheque was genuine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tut-tut!” said Mr. Utterson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see you feel as I do,” said Mr. Enfield. “Yes, it’s a bad story. For\n",
      "my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really\n",
      "damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of\n",
      "the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your\n",
      "fellows who do what they call good. Blackmail, I suppose; an honest man\n",
      "paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail\n",
      "House is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though\n",
      "even that, you know, is far from explaining all,” he added, and with\n",
      "the words fell into a vein of musing.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: “And\n",
      "you don’t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A likely place, isn’t it?” returned Mr. Enfield. “But I happen to have\n",
      "noticed his address; he lives in some square or other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you never asked about the—place with the door?” said Mr. Utterson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir; I had a delicacy,” was the reply. “I feel very strongly about\n",
      "putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of\n",
      "judgment. You start a question, and it’s like starting a stone. You sit\n",
      "quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others;\n",
      "and presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of)\n",
      "is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to\n",
      "change their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks\n",
      "like Queer Street, the less I ask.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A very good rule, too,” said the lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I have studied the place for myself,” continued Mr. Enfield. “It\n",
      "seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or\n",
      "out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my\n",
      "adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first\n",
      "floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they’re clean. And\n",
      "then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must\n",
      "live there. And yet it’s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed\n",
      "together about the court, that it’s hard to say where one ends and\n",
      "another begins.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then “Enfield,”\n",
      "said Mr. Utterson, “that’s a good rule of yours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I think it is,” returned Enfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But for all that,” continued the lawyer, “there’s one point I want to\n",
      "ask. I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Mr. Enfield, “I can’t see what harm it would do. It was a\n",
      "man of the name of Hyde.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hm,” said Mr. Utterson. “What sort of a man is he to see?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his\n",
      "appearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I\n",
      "never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be\n",
      "deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I\n",
      "couldn’t specify the point. He’s an extraordinary looking man, and yet\n",
      "I really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand\n",
      "of it; I can’t describe him. And it’s not want of memory; for I declare\n",
      "I can see him this moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a\n",
      "weight of consideration. “You are sure he used a key?” he inquired at\n",
      "last.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear sir...” began Enfield, surprised out of himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I know,” said Utterson; “I know it must seem strange. The fact\n",
      "is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I\n",
      "know it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have\n",
      "been inexact in any point you had better correct it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think you might have warned me,” returned the other with a touch of\n",
      "sullenness. “But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The\n",
      "fellow had a key; and what’s more, he has it still. I saw him use it\n",
      "not a week ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man\n",
      "presently resumed. “Here is another lesson to say nothing,” said he. “I\n",
      "am ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to\n",
      "this again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With all my heart,” said the lawyer. “I shake hands on that, Richard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "SEARCH FOR MR. HYDE\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre\n",
      "spirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a\n",
      "Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of\n",
      "some dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the\n",
      "neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go\n",
      "soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the\n",
      "cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business\n",
      "room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a\n",
      "document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll’s Will and sat down\n",
      "with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for\n",
      "Mr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had\n",
      "refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided\n",
      "not only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L.,\n",
      "L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands\n",
      "of his “friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,” but that in case of Dr.\n",
      "Jekyll’s “disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding\n",
      "three calendar months,” the said Edward Hyde should step into the said\n",
      "Henry Jekyll’s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or\n",
      "obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the\n",
      "doctor’s household. This document had long been the lawyer’s eyesore.\n",
      "It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and\n",
      "customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And\n",
      "hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his\n",
      "indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was\n",
      "already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn\n",
      "no more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable\n",
      "attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so\n",
      "long baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment\n",
      "of a fiend.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought it was madness,” he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper\n",
      "in the safe, “and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in\n",
      "the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his\n",
      "friend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding\n",
      "patients. “If anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,” he had thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage\n",
      "of delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr.\n",
      "Lanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper,\n",
      "red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a\n",
      "boisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up\n",
      "from his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was\n",
      "the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed\n",
      "on genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at\n",
      "school and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each\n",
      "other, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each\n",
      "other’s company.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so\n",
      "disagreeably preoccupied his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose, Lanyon,” said he, “you and I must be the two oldest friends\n",
      "that Henry Jekyll has?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish the friends were younger,” chuckled Dr. Lanyon. “But I suppose\n",
      "we are. And what of that? I see little of him now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed?” said Utterson. “I thought you had a bond of common interest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We had,” was the reply. “But it is more than ten years since Henry\n",
      "Jekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind;\n",
      "and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old\n",
      "sake’s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the\n",
      "man. Such unscientific balderdash,” added the doctor, flushing suddenly\n",
      "purple, “would have estranged Damon and Pythias.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.\n",
      "“They have only differed on some point of science,” he thought; and\n",
      "being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of\n",
      "conveyancing), he even added: “It is nothing worse than that!” He gave\n",
      "his friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached\n",
      "the question he had come to put. “Did you ever come across a _protégé_\n",
      "of his—one Hyde?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hyde?” repeated Lanyon. “No. Never heard of him. Since my time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with\n",
      "him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the\n",
      "small hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of\n",
      "little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged\n",
      "by questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six o’clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently\n",
      "near to Mr. Utterson’s dwelling, and still he was digging at the\n",
      "problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone;\n",
      "but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he\n",
      "lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained\n",
      "room, Mr. Enfield’s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted\n",
      "pictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal\n",
      "city; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child\n",
      "running from the doctor’s; and then these met, and that human\n",
      "Juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams.\n",
      "Or else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay\n",
      "asleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that\n",
      "room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the\n",
      "sleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to\n",
      "whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do\n",
      "its bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all\n",
      "night; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide\n",
      "more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and\n",
      "still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of\n",
      "lamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave\n",
      "her screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know\n",
      "it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and\n",
      "melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew\n",
      "apace in the lawyer’s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate,\n",
      "curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but\n",
      "once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps\n",
      "roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well\n",
      "examined. He might see a reason for his friend’s strange preference or\n",
      "bondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of\n",
      "the will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man\n",
      "who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to\n",
      "raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of\n",
      "enduring hatred.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the\n",
      "by-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when\n",
      "business was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of the\n",
      "fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or\n",
      "concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he be Mr. Hyde,” he had thought, “I shall be Mr. Seek.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost\n",
      "in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps,\n",
      "unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By\n",
      "ten o’clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very\n",
      "solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very\n",
      "silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses\n",
      "were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of\n",
      "the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson\n",
      "had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light\n",
      "footstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had\n",
      "long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of\n",
      "a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out\n",
      "distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention\n",
      "had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was\n",
      "with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into\n",
      "the entry of the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they\n",
      "turned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry,\n",
      "could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and\n",
      "very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went\n",
      "somehow strongly against the watcher’s inclination. But he made\n",
      "straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he\n",
      "came, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.\n",
      "“Mr. Hyde, I think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear\n",
      "was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face,\n",
      "he answered coolly enough: “That is my name. What do you want?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see you are going in,” returned the lawyer. “I am an old friend of\n",
      "Dr. Jekyll’s—Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street—you must have heard of my\n",
      "name; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,” replied Mr. Hyde,\n",
      "blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,\n",
      "“How did you know me?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On your side,” said Mr. Utterson “will you do me a favour?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With pleasure,” replied the other. “What shall it be?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you let me see your face?” asked the lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden\n",
      "reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared\n",
      "at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. “Now I shall know you\n",
      "again,” said Mr. Utterson. “It may be useful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” returned Mr. Hyde, “It is as well we have met; and _à propos_,\n",
      "you should have my address.” And he gave a number of a street in Soho.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good God!” thought Mr. Utterson, “can he, too, have been thinking of\n",
      "the will?” But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in\n",
      "acknowledgment of the address.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now,” said the other, “how did you know me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By description,” was the reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whose description?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have common friends,” said Mr. Utterson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Common friends,” echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. “Who are they?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jekyll, for instance,” said the lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He never told you,” cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. “I did not\n",
      "think you would have lied.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come,” said Mr. Utterson, “that is not fitting language.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with\n",
      "extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into\n",
      "the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of\n",
      "disquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every\n",
      "step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental\n",
      "perplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a\n",
      "class that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an\n",
      "impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a\n",
      "displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of\n",
      "murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,\n",
      "whispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against\n",
      "him, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown\n",
      "disgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. “There\n",
      "must be something else,” said the perplexed gentleman. “There _is_\n",
      "something more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man\n",
      "seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be\n",
      "the old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul\n",
      "that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The\n",
      "last, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan’s\n",
      "signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,\n",
      "handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate\n",
      "and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men;\n",
      "map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure\n",
      "enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still\n",
      "occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of\n",
      "wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for\n",
      "the fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly\n",
      "servant opened the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?” asked the lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will see, Mr. Utterson,” said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he\n",
      "spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags,\n",
      "warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,\n",
      "and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. “Will you wait here by the\n",
      "fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here, thank you,” said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the\n",
      "tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy\n",
      "of his friend the doctor’s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of\n",
      "it as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder\n",
      "in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what\n",
      "was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of\n",
      "his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the\n",
      "firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the\n",
      "shadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently\n",
      "returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,” he said. “Is\n",
      "that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,” replied the servant. “Mr. Hyde has a\n",
      "key.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man,\n",
      "Poole,” resumed the other musingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir, he does indeed,” said Poole. “We have all orders to obey\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?” asked Utterson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O, dear no, sir. He never _dines_ here,” replied the butler. “Indeed\n",
      "we see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes\n",
      "and goes by the laboratory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, good-night, Poole.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-night, Mr. Utterson.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. “Poor Harry\n",
      "Jekyll,” he thought, “my mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was\n",
      "wild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of\n",
      "God, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost\n",
      "of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment\n",
      "coming, _pede claudo_, years after memory has forgotten and self-love\n",
      "condoned the fault.” And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded\n",
      "awhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least by\n",
      "chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light\n",
      "there. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of\n",
      "their life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by\n",
      "the many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and\n",
      "fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.\n",
      "And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of\n",
      "hope. “This Master Hyde, if he were studied,” thought he, “must have\n",
      "secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared\n",
      "to which poor Jekyll’s worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot\n",
      "continue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature\n",
      "stealing like a thief to Harry’s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening!\n",
      "And the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the\n",
      "will, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to\n",
      "the wheel—if Jekyll will but let me,” he added, “if Jekyll will only\n",
      "let me.” For once more he saw before his mind’s eye, as clear as\n",
      "transparency, the strange clauses of the will.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE\n",
      "\n",
      "A fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of\n",
      "his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent,\n",
      "reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so\n",
      "contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. This\n",
      "was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of\n",
      "times. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to\n",
      "detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had\n",
      "already their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his\n",
      "unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in\n",
      "the man’s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this\n",
      "rule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite\n",
      "side of the fire—a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with\n",
      "something of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and\n",
      "kindness—you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson\n",
      "a sincere and warm affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,” began the latter. “You\n",
      "know that will of yours?”\n",
      "\n",
      "A close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful;\n",
      "but the doctor carried it off gaily. “My poor Utterson,” said he, “you\n",
      "are unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as\n",
      "you were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at\n",
      "what he called my scientific heresies. O, I know he’s a good fellow—you\n",
      "needn’t frown—an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of\n",
      "him; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant.\n",
      "I was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know I never approved of it,” pursued Utterson, ruthlessly\n",
      "disregarding the fresh topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,” said the doctor, a trifle\n",
      "sharply. “You have told me so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I tell you so again,” continued the lawyer. “I have been\n",
      "learning something of young Hyde.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and\n",
      "there came a blackness about his eyes. “I do not care to hear more,”\n",
      "said he. “This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I heard was abominable,” said Utterson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It can make no change. You do not understand my position,” returned\n",
      "the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. “I am painfully\n",
      "situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange—a very strange one.\n",
      "It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jekyll,” said Utterson, “you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a\n",
      "clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you\n",
      "out of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My good Utterson,” said the doctor, “this is very good of you, this is\n",
      "downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I\n",
      "believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before\n",
      "myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn’t what you fancy;\n",
      "it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I\n",
      "will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.\n",
      "I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I\n",
      "will just add one little word, Utterson, that I’m sure you’ll take in\n",
      "good part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no doubt you are perfectly right,” he said at last, getting to\n",
      "his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last\n",
      "time I hope,” continued the doctor, “there is one point I should like\n",
      "you to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. I\n",
      "know you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I do\n",
      "sincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if\n",
      "I am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear\n",
      "with him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew\n",
      "all; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t pretend that I shall ever like him,” said the lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t ask that,” pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other’s\n",
      "arm; “I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake,\n",
      "when I am no longer here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. “Well,” said he, “I promise.”\n",

      "THE CAREW MURDER CASE\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18—, London was startled\n",
      "by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by\n",
      "the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A\n",
      "maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone\n",
      "upstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in\n",
      "the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the\n",
      "lane, which the maid’s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the\n",
      "full moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon\n",
      "her box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a\n",
      "dream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she\n",
      "narrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all\n",
      "men or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she became\n",
      "aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near\n",
      "along the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small\n",
      "gentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had come\n",
      "within speech (which was just under the maid’s eyes) the older man\n",
      "bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness.\n",
      "It did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great\n",
      "importance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he\n",
      "were only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he\n",
      "spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such\n",
      "an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something\n",
      "high too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye wandered\n",
      "to the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr.\n",
      "Hyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a\n",
      "dislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling;\n",
      "but he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an\n",
      "ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke out in a\n",
      "great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and\n",
      "carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman\n",
      "took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle\n",
      "hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to\n",
      "the earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his\n",
      "victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the\n",
      "bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At\n",
      "the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was two o’clock when she came to herself and called for the police.\n",
      "The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle\n",
      "of the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been\n",
      "done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had\n",
      "broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and\n",
      "one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter—the other,\n",
      "without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold\n",
      "watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a\n",
      "sealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the\n",
      "post, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of\n",
      "bed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than\n",
      "he shot out a solemn lip. “I shall say nothing till I have seen the\n",
      "body,” said he; “this may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait\n",
      "while I dress.” And with the same grave countenance he hurried through\n",
      "his breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had\n",
      "been carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said he, “I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir\n",
      "Danvers Carew.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good God, sir,” exclaimed the officer, “is it possible?” And the next\n",
      "moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. “This will make a\n",
      "deal of noise,” he said. “And perhaps you can help us to the man.” And\n",
      "he briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken\n",
      "stick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the\n",
      "stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and\n",
      "battered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself\n",
      "presented many years before to Henry Jekyll.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?” he inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid\n",
      "calls him,” said the officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, “If you will come\n",
      "with me in my cab,” he said, “I think I can take you to his house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the\n",
      "season. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the\n",
      "wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so\n",
      "that as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a\n",
      "marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be\n",
      "dark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich,\n",
      "lurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here,\n",
      "for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of\n",
      "daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal\n",
      "quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy\n",
      "ways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been\n",
      "extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful\n",
      "reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer’s eyes, like a district\n",
      "of some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of\n",
      "the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive,\n",
      "he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law’s\n",
      "officers, which may at times assail the most honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a\n",
      "little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating\n",
      "house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many\n",
      "ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many\n",
      "different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning\n",
      "glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part,\n",
      "as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings.\n",
      "This was the home of Henry Jekyll’s favourite; of a man who was heir to\n",
      "a quarter of a million sterling.\n",
      "\n",
      "An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an\n",
      "evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes,\n",
      "she said, this was Mr. Hyde’s, but he was not at home; he had been in\n",
      "that night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour;\n",
      "there was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and\n",
      "he was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she\n",
      "had seen him till yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,” said the lawyer; and when\n",
      "the woman began to declare it was impossible, “I had better tell you\n",
      "who this person is,” he added. “This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland\n",
      "Yard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman’s face. “Ah!” said she,\n",
      "“he is in trouble! What has he done?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. “He don’t seem a very\n",
      "popular character,” observed the latter. “And now, my good woman, just\n",
      "let me and this gentleman have a look about us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained\n",
      "otherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these\n",
      "were furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with\n",
      "wine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung\n",
      "upon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who\n",
      "was much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and\n",
      "agreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark\n",
      "of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the\n",
      "floor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and\n",
      "on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had\n",
      "been burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end\n",
      "of a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the\n",
      "other half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched\n",
      "his suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the\n",
      "bank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the\n",
      "murderer’s credit, completed his gratification.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may depend upon it, sir,” he told Mr. Utterson: “I have him in my\n",
      "hand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick\n",
      "or, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money’s life to the man. We\n",
      "have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the\n",
      "handbills.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had\n",
      "numbered few familiars—even the master of the servant maid had only\n",
      "seen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been\n",
      "photographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as\n",
      "common observers will. Only on one point were they agreed; and that was\n",
      "the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive\n",
      "impressed his beholders.\n",

      "INCIDENT OF THE LETTER\n",
      "\n",
      "It was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr.\n",
      "Jekyll’s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down\n",
      "by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden,\n",
      "to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or\n",
      "dissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a\n",
      "celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than\n",
      "anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of\n",
      "the garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in\n",
      "that part of his friend’s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless\n",
      "structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of\n",
      "strangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students\n",
      "and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical\n",
      "apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing\n",
      "straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the\n",
      "further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red\n",
      "baize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the\n",
      "doctor’s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses,\n",
      "furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business\n",
      "table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred\n",
      "with iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the\n",
      "chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and\n",
      "there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He\n",
      "did not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him\n",
      "welcome in a changed voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now,” said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, “you have\n",
      "heard the news?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor shuddered. “They were crying it in the square,” he said. “I\n",
      "heard them in my dining-room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One word,” said the lawyer. “Carew was my client, but so are you, and\n",
      "I want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide\n",
      "this fellow?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Utterson, I swear to God,” cried the doctor, “I swear to God I will\n",
      "never set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done\n",
      "with him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not\n",
      "want my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite\n",
      "safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend’s feverish\n",
      "manner. “You seem pretty sure of him,” said he; “and for your sake, I\n",
      "hope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am quite sure of him,” replied Jekyll; “I have grounds for certainty\n",
      "that I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you\n",
      "may advise me. I have—I have received a letter; and I am at a loss\n",
      "whether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in\n",
      "your hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so\n",
      "great a trust in you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?” asked the\n",
      "lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the other. “I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I\n",
      "am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this\n",
      "hateful business has rather exposed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Utterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend’s\n",
      "selfishness, and yet relieved by it. “Well,” said he, at last, “let me\n",
      "see the letter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed “Edward\n",
      "Hyde”: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer’s benefactor,\n",
      "Dr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand\n",
      "generosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had\n",
      "means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked\n",
      "this letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he\n",
      "had looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you the envelope?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I burned it,” replied Jekyll, “before I thought what I was about. But\n",
      "it bore no postmark. The note was handed in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?” asked Utterson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish you to judge for me entirely,” was the reply. “I have lost\n",
      "confidence in myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I shall consider,” returned the lawyer. “And now one word more:\n",
      "it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that\n",
      "disappearance?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth\n",
      "tight and nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I knew it,” said Utterson. “He meant to murder you. You had a fine\n",
      "escape.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have had what is far more to the purpose,” returned the doctor\n",
      "solemnly: “I have had a lesson—O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have\n",
      "had!” And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "On his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole.\n",
      "“By the bye,” said he, “there was a letter handed in to-day: what was\n",
      "the messenger like?” But Poole was positive nothing had come except by\n",
      "post; “and only circulars by that,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "This news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the\n",
      "letter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been\n",
      "written in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently\n",
      "judged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went,\n",
      "were crying themselves hoarse along the footways: “Special edition.\n",
      "Shocking murder of an M.P.” That was the funeral oration of one friend\n",
      "and client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good\n",
      "name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It\n",
      "was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and\n",
      "self-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for\n",
      "advice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it\n",
      "might be fished for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest,\n",
      "his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely\n",
      "calculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine\n",
      "that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The fog\n",
      "still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps\n",
      "glimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these\n",
      "fallen clouds, the procession of the town’s life was still rolling in\n",
      "through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the\n",
      "room was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago\n",
      "resolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows\n",
      "richer in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on\n",
      "hillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs\n",
      "of London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he\n",
      "kept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he\n",
      "kept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the\n",
      "doctor’s; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr.\n",
      "Hyde’s familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it\n",
      "not as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery\n",
      "to right? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic\n",
      "of handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The\n",
      "clerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a\n",
      "document without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson\n",
      "might shape his future course.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,”\n",
      "returned Guest. “The man, of course, was mad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like to hear your views on that,” replied Utterson. “I have a\n",
      "document here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce\n",
      "know what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there\n",
      "it is; quite in your way: a murderer’s autograph.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Guest’s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with\n",
      "passion. “No sir,” he said: “not mad; but it is an odd hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And by all accounts a very odd writer,” added the lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then the servant entered with a note.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?” inquired the clerk. “I thought I knew\n",
      "the writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One moment. I thank you, sir;” and the clerk laid the two sheets of\n",
      "paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. “Thank you,\n",
      "sir,” he said at last, returning both; “it’s a very interesting\n",
      "autograph.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself.\n",
      "“Why did you compare them, Guest?” he inquired suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, sir,” returned the clerk, “there’s a rather singular\n",
      "resemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only\n",
      "differently sloped.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rather quaint,” said Utterson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is, as you say, rather quaint,” returned Guest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wouldn’t speak of this note, you know,” said the master.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir,” said the clerk. “I understand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the\n",
      "note into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. “What!” he\n",
      "thought. “Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer!” And his blood ran cold in\n",

      "\n",
      "Time ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death\n",
      "of Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had\n",
      "disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never\n",
      "existed. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable:\n",
      "tales came out of the man’s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of\n",
      "his vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to\n",
      "have surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a\n",
      "whisper. From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of\n",
      "the murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on,\n",
      "Mr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to\n",
      "grow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his\n",
      "way of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde.\n",
      "Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for\n",
      "Dr. Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his\n",
      "friends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and\n",
      "whilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less\n",
      "distinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air,\n",
      "he did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward\n",
      "consciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was\n",
      "at peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor’s with a small\n",
      "party; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from\n",
      "one to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable\n",
      "friends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against\n",
      "the lawyer. “The doctor was confined to the house,” Poole said, “and\n",
      "saw no one.” On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and\n",
      "having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost\n",
      "daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The\n",
      "fifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook\n",
      "himself to Dr. Lanyon’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he\n",
      "was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor’s\n",
      "appearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The\n",
      "rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly\n",
      "balder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift\n",
      "physical decay that arrested the lawyer’s notice, as a look in the eye\n",
      "and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror\n",
      "of the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet\n",
      "that was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. “Yes,” he thought; “he\n",
      "is a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted;\n",
      "and the knowledge is more than he can bear.” And yet when Utterson\n",
      "remarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness that\n",
      "Lanyon declared himself a doomed man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have had a shock,” he said, “and I shall never recover. It is a\n",
      "question of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir,\n",
      "I used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more\n",
      "glad to get away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jekyll is ill, too,” observed Utterson. “Have you seen him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Lanyon’s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. “I wish to\n",
      "see or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,” he said in a loud, unsteady voice.\n",
      "“I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any\n",
      "allusion to one whom I regard as dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tut, tut!” said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,\n",
      "“Can’t I do anything?” he inquired. “We are three very old friends,\n",
      "Lanyon; we shall not live to make others.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing can be done,” returned Lanyon; “ask himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He will not see me,” said the lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not surprised at that,” was the reply. “Some day, Utterson, after\n",
      "I am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I\n",
      "cannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me\n",
      "of other things, for God’s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep\n",
      "clear of this accursed topic, then in God’s name, go, for I cannot bear\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,\n",
      "complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of\n",
      "this unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long\n",
      "answer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious\n",
      "in drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. “I do not blame our\n",
      "old friend,” Jekyll wrote, “but I share his view that we must never\n",
      "meet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you\n",
      "must not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is\n",
      "often shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I\n",
      "have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If\n",
      "I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could\n",
      "not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors\n",
      "so unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this\n",
      "destiny, and that is to respect my silence.” Utterson was amazed; the\n",
      "dark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to\n",
      "his old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with\n",
      "every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment,\n",
      "friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were\n",
      "wrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in\n",
      "view of Lanyon’s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper\n",
      "ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "A week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less\n",
      "than a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he\n",
      "had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room,\n",
      "and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set\n",
      "before him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal\n",
      "of his dead friend. “PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE,\n",
      "and in case of his predecease _to be destroyed unread_,” so it was\n",
      "emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the\n",
      "contents. “I have buried one friend to-day,” he thought: “what if this\n",
      "should cost me another?” And then he condemned the fear as a\n",
      "disloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure,\n",
      "likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as “not to be opened till\n",
      "the death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.” Utterson could not\n",
      "trust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad\n",
      "will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the\n",
      "idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in\n",
      "the will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man\n",
      "Hyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible.\n",
      "Written by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity\n",
      "came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to\n",
      "the bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his\n",
      "dead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the\n",
      "inmost corner of his private safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may\n",
      "be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his\n",
      "surviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but\n",
      "his thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but\n",
      "he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart,\n",
      "he preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by\n",
      "the air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into\n",
      "that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its\n",
      "inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to\n",
      "communicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined\n",
      "himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes\n",
      "even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not\n",
      "read; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became so\n",
      "used to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off\n",
      "little by little in the frequency of his visits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW\n",
      "\n",
      "It chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.\n",
      "Enfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that\n",
      "when they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Enfield, “that story’s at an end at least. We shall never\n",
      "see more of Mr. Hyde.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope not,” said Utterson. “Did I ever tell you that I once saw him,\n",
      "and shared your feeling of repulsion?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was impossible to do the one without the other,” returned Enfield.\n",
      "“And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that\n",
      "this was a back way to Dr. Jekyll’s! It was partly your own fault that\n",
      "I found it out, even when I did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you found it out, did you?” said Utterson. “But if that be so, we\n",
      "may step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the\n",
      "truth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if\n",
      "the presence of a friend might do him good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature\n",
      "twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with\n",
      "sunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and\n",
      "sitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of\n",
      "mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! Jekyll!” he cried. “I trust you are better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am very low, Utterson,” replied the doctor drearily, “very low. It\n",
      "will not last long, thank God.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You stay too much indoors,” said the lawyer. “You should be out,\n",
      "whipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my\n",
      "cousin—Mr. Enfield—Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a quick\n",
      "turn with us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are very good,” sighed the other. “I should like to very much; but\n",
      "no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I\n",
      "am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask\n",
      "you and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, then,” said the lawyer, good-naturedly, “the best thing we can do\n",
      "is to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is just what I was about to venture to propose,” returned the\n",
      "doctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before the\n",
      "smile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such\n",
      "abject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen\n",
      "below. They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly\n",
      "thrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and\n",
      "left the court without a word. In silence, too, they traversed the\n",
      "by-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring\n",
      "thoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings\n",
      "of life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion.\n",
      "They were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“God forgive us, God forgive us,” said Mr. Utterson.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once\n",
      "more in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE LAST NIGHT\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when\n",
      "he was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?” he cried; and then taking a\n",
      "second look at him, “What ails you?” he added; “is the doctor ill?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Utterson,” said the man, “there is something wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,” said the lawyer.\n",
      "“Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know the doctor’s ways, sir,” replied Poole, “and how he shuts\n",
      "himself up. Well, he’s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don’t like\n",
      "it, sir—I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I’m afraid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, my good man,” said the lawyer, “be explicit. What are you afraid\n",
      "of?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve been afraid for about a week,” returned Poole, doggedly\n",
      "disregarding the question, “and I can bear it no more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man’s appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered\n",
      "for the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced\n",
      "his terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he\n",
      "sat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed\n",
      "to a corner of the floor. “I can bear it no more,” he repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come,” said the lawyer, “I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see\n",
      "there is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think there’s been foul play,” said Poole, hoarsely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Foul play!” cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather\n",
      "inclined to be irritated in consequence. “What foul play! What does the\n",
      "man mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I daren’t say, sir,” was the answer; “but will you come along with me\n",
      "and see for yourself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Utterson’s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;\n",
      "but he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared\n",
      "upon the butler’s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was\n",
      "still untasted when he set it down to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying\n",
      "on her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the\n",
      "most diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and\n",
      "flecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets\n",
      "unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had\n",
      "never seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it\n",
      "otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish\n",
      "to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there\n",
      "was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The\n",
      "square, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin\n",
      "trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole,\n",
      "who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the\n",
      "middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off\n",
      "his hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all\n",
      "the hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he\n",
      "wiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face\n",
      "was white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, sir,” he said, “here we are, and God grant there be nothing\n",
      "wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Amen, Poole,” said the lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was\n",
      "opened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, “Is that you,\n",
      "Poole?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s all right,” said Poole. “Open the door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was\n",
      "built high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and\n",
      "women, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of\n",
      "Mr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the\n",
      "cook, crying out “Bless God! it’s Mr. Utterson,” ran forward as if to\n",
      "take him in her arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What, what? Are you all here?” said the lawyer peevishly. “Very\n",
      "irregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They’re all afraid,” said Poole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her\n",
      "voice and now wept loudly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold your tongue!” Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that\n",
      "testified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so\n",
      "suddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and\n",
      "turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. “And\n",
      "now,” continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, “reach me a\n",
      "candle, and we’ll get this through hands at once.” And then he begged\n",
      "Mr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, sir,” said he, “you come as gently as you can. I want you to\n",
      "hear, and I don’t want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any\n",
      "chance he was to ask you in, don’t go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Utterson’s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk\n",
      "that nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage\n",
      "and followed the butler into the laboratory building through the\n",
      "surgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of\n",
      "the stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen;\n",
      "while he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and\n",
      "obvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a\n",
      "somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,” he called; and even as he did\n",
      "so, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "A voice answered from within: “Tell him I cannot see anyone,” it said\n",
      "complainingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, sir,” said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in\n",
      "his voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across\n",
      "the yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the\n",
      "beetles were leaping on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, “Was that my master’s\n",
      "voice?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It seems much changed,” replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look\n",
      "for look.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Changed? Well, yes, I think so,” said the butler. “Have I been twenty\n",
      "years in this man’s house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir;\n",
      "master’s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we\n",
      "heard him cry out upon the name of God; and _who’s_ in there instead of\n",
      "him, and _why_ it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr.\n",
      "Utterson!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my\n",
      "man,” said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. “Suppose it were as you\n",
      "suppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been—well, murdered, what could\n",
      "induce the murderer to stay? That won’t hold water; it doesn’t commend\n",
      "itself to reason.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I’ll do it\n",
      "yet,” said Poole. “All this last week (you must know) him, or it,\n",
      "whatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and\n",
      "day for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was\n",
      "sometimes his way—the master’s, that is—to write his orders on a sheet\n",
      "of paper and throw it on the stair. We’ve had nothing else this week\n",
      "back; nothing but papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left\n",
      "there to be smuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day,\n",
      "ay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and\n",
      "complaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists\n",
      "in town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another\n",
      "paper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and another\n",
      "order to a different firm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir,\n",
      "whatever for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you any of these papers?” asked Mr. Utterson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the\n",
      "lawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents\n",
      "ran thus: “Dr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He\n",
      "assures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his\n",
      "present purpose. In the year 18—, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large\n",
      "quantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedulous\n",
      "care, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at\n",
      "once. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can\n",
      "hardly be exaggerated.” So far the letter had run composedly enough,\n",
      "but here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer’s emotion had\n",
      "broken loose. “For God’s sake,” he added, “find me some of the old.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a strange note,” said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, “How do\n",
      "you come to have it open?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The man at Maw’s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like\n",
      "so much dirt,” returned Poole.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is unquestionably the doctor’s hand, do you know?” resumed the\n",
      "lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought it looked like it,” said the servant rather sulkily; and\n",
      "then, with another voice, “But what matters hand of write?” he said.\n",
      "“I’ve seen him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seen him?” repeated Mr. Utterson. “Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s it!” said Poole. “It was this way. I came suddenly into the\n",
      "theatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this\n",
      "drug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was\n",
      "at the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when\n",
      "I came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet.\n",
      "It was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my\n",
      "head like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon\n",
      "his face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run\n",
      "from me? I have served him long enough. And then...” The man paused and\n",
      "passed his hand over his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These are all very strange circumstances,” said Mr. Utterson, “but I\n",
      "think I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is plainly seized\n",
      "with one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer;\n",
      "hence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask\n",
      "and the avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this\n",
      "drug, by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate\n",
      "recovery—God grant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; it\n",
      "is sad enough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain\n",
      "and natural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant\n",
      "alarms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, “that\n",
      "thing was not my master, and there’s the truth. My master”—here he\n",
      "looked round him and began to whisper—“is a tall, fine build of a man,\n",
      "and this was more of a dwarf.” Utterson attempted to protest. “O, sir,”\n",
      "cried Poole, “do you think I do not know my master after twenty years?\n",
      "Do you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door,\n",
      "where I saw him every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in the\n",
      "mask was never Dr. Jekyll—God knows what it was, but it was never Dr.\n",
      "Jekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poole,” replied the lawyer, “if you say that, it will become my duty\n",
      "to make certain. Much as I desire to spare your master’s feelings, much\n",
      "as I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still\n",
      "alive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, Mr. Utterson, that’s talking!” cried the butler.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now comes the second question,” resumed Utterson: “Who is going to\n",
      "do it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, you and me, sir,” was the undaunted reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s very well said,” returned the lawyer; “and whatever comes of\n",
      "it, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is an axe in the theatre,” continued Poole; “and you might take\n",
      "the kitchen poker for yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and\n",
      "balanced it. “Do you know, Poole,” he said, looking up, “that you and I\n",
      "are about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may say so, sir, indeed,” returned the butler.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is well, then that we should be frank,” said the other. “We both\n",
      "think more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This masked\n",
      "figure that you saw, did you recognise it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that\n",
      "I could hardly swear to that,” was the answer. “But if you mean, was it\n",
      "Mr. Hyde?—why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same\n",
      "bigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who\n",
      "else could have got in by the laboratory door? You have not forgot,\n",
      "sir, that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him? But\n",
      "that’s not all. I don’t know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr.\n",
      "Hyde?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the lawyer, “I once spoke with him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something\n",
      "queer about that gentleman—something that gave a man a turn—I don’t\n",
      "know rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your\n",
      "marrow kind of cold and thin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I own I felt something of what you describe,” said Mr. Utterson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite so, sir,” returned Poole. “Well, when that masked thing like a\n",
      "monkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it\n",
      "went down my spine like ice. O, I know it’s not evidence, Mr. Utterson;\n",
      "I’m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I\n",
      "give you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, ay,” said the lawyer. “My fears incline to the same point. Evil, I\n",
      "fear, founded—evil was sure to come—of that connection. Ay truly, I\n",
      "believe you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer\n",
      "(for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim’s\n",
      "room. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pull yourself together, Bradshaw,” said the lawyer. “This suspense, I\n",
      "know, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make\n",
      "an end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the\n",
      "cabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear the\n",
      "blame. Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any\n",
      "malefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round\n",
      "the corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the\n",
      "laboratory door. We give you ten minutes to get to your stations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. “And now, Poole, let\n",
      "us get to ours,” he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the\n",
      "way into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now\n",
      "quite dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that\n",
      "deep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about\n",
      "their steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where\n",
      "they sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but\n",
      "nearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a\n",
      "footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So it will walk all day, sir,” whispered Poole; “ay, and the better\n",
      "part of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist,\n",
      "there’s a bit of a break. Ah, it’s an ill conscience that’s such an\n",
      "enemy to rest! Ah, sir, there’s blood foully shed in every step of it!\n",
      "But hark again, a little closer—put your heart in your ears, Mr.\n",
      "Utterson, and tell me, is that the doctor’s foot?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they\n",
      "went so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread\n",
      "of Henry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. “Is there never anything else?” he\n",
      "asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poole nodded. “Once,” he said. “Once I heard it weeping!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Weeping? how that?” said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of\n",
      "horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,” said the butler. “I came away\n",
      "with that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe from\n",
      "under a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest\n",
      "table to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath\n",
      "to where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in\n",
      "the quiet of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jekyll,” cried Utterson, with a loud voice, “I demand to see you.” He\n",
      "paused a moment, but there came no reply. “I give you fair warning, our\n",
      "suspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,” he resumed; “if\n",
      "not by fair means, then by foul—if not of your consent, then by brute\n",
      "force!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Utterson,” said the voice, “for God’s sake, have mercy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, that’s not Jekyll’s voice—it’s Hyde’s!” cried Utterson. “Down with\n",
      "the door, Poole!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Poole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and\n",
      "the red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal\n",
      "screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the\n",
      "axe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four\n",
      "times the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of\n",
      "excellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock\n",
      "burst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had\n",
      "succeeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet\n",
      "before their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and\n",
      "chattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer\n",
      "or two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer\n",
      "the fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you would\n",
      "have said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most\n",
      "commonplace that night in London.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and\n",
      "still twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and\n",
      "beheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in clothes far too large\n",
      "for him, clothes of the doctor’s bigness; the cords of his face still\n",
      "moved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by the\n",
      "crushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung\n",
      "upon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a\n",
      "self-destroyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have come too late,” he said sternly, “whether to save or punish.\n",
      "Hyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the\n",
      "body of your master.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre,\n",
      "which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above,\n",
      "and by the cabinet, which formed an upper storey at one end and looked\n",
      "upon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the\n",
      "by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a\n",
      "second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a\n",
      "spacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet\n",
      "needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell\n",
      "from their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was\n",
      "filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon\n",
      "who was Jekyll’s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they\n",
      "were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a\n",
      "perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance.\n",
      "Nowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poole stamped on the flags of the corridor. “He must be buried here,”\n",
      "he said, hearkening to the sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or he may have fled,” said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door\n",
      "in the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they\n",
      "found the key, already stained with rust.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This does not look like use,” observed the lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Use!” echoed Poole. “Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a\n",
      "man had stamped on it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay,” continued Utterson, “and the fractures, too, are rusty.” The two\n",
      "men looked at each other with a scare. “This is beyond me, Poole,” said\n",
      "the lawyer. “Let us go back to the cabinet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional\n",
      "awestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine\n",
      "the contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of\n",
      "chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on\n",
      "glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had\n",
      "been prevented.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,” said Poole; and\n",
      "even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.\n",
      "\n",
      "This brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn\n",
      "cosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter’s elbow, the\n",
      "very sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay\n",
      "beside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy\n",
      "of a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great\n",
      "esteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came\n",
      "to the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary\n",
      "horror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow\n",
      "playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along\n",
      "the glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful\n",
      "countenances stooping to look in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This glass has seen some strange things, sir,” whispered Poole.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And surely none stranger than itself,” echoed the lawyer in the same\n",
      "tones. “For what did Jekyll”—he caught himself up at the word with a\n",
      "start, and then conquering the weakness—“what could Jekyll want with\n",
      "it?” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may say that!” said Poole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat\n",
      "array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the\n",
      "doctor’s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and\n",
      "several enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in\n",
      "the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months\n",
      "before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift\n",
      "in case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the\n",
      "lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John\n",
      "Utterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of\n",
      "all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My head goes round,” he said. “He has been all these days in\n",
      "possession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see\n",
      "himself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor’s hand\n",
      "and dated at the top. “O Poole!” the lawyer cried, “he was alive and\n",
      "here this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he\n",
      "must be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how?\n",
      "and in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be\n",
      "careful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire\n",
      "catastrophe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t you read it, sir?” asked Poole.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because I fear,” replied the lawyer solemnly. “God grant I have no\n",
      "cause for it!” And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read\n",
      "as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Utterson,—When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have\n",
      "disappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to\n",
      "foresee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless\n",
      "situation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and\n",
      "first read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your\n",
      "hands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your unworthy and unhappy friend,\n",
      "\n",
      "“HENRY JEKYLL.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was a third enclosure?” asked Utterson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here, sir,” said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet\n",
      "sealed in several places.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer put it in his pocket. “I would say nothing of this paper. If\n",
      "your master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is\n",
      "now ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall\n",
      "be back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and\n",
      "Utterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the\n",
      "hall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which\n",
      "this mystery was now to be explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DR. LANYON’S NARRATIVE\n",
      "\n",
      "On the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening\n",
      "delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague\n",
      "and old school companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised by\n",
      "this; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had\n",
      "seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could\n",
      "imagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of\n",
      "registration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the\n",
      "letter ran:\n",
      "\n",
      "“10_th December_, 18—.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Lanyon,—You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may\n",
      "have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at\n",
      "least on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day\n",
      "when, if you had said to me, ‘Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason,\n",
      "depend upon you,’ I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you.\n",
      "Lanyon, my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you\n",
      "fail me to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface,\n",
      "that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge\n",
      "for yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night—ay, even if\n",
      "you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless\n",
      "your carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in\n",
      "your hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my\n",
      "butler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a\n",
      "locksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced; and you are to\n",
      "go in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand,\n",
      "breaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, _with all its\n",
      "contents as they stand_, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is\n",
      "the same thing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of\n",
      "mind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in\n",
      "error, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a\n",
      "phial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you\n",
      "to Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should\n",
      "be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before\n",
      "midnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the\n",
      "fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor\n",
      "foreseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be\n",
      "preferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to\n",
      "ask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own\n",
      "hand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to\n",
      "place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from\n",
      "my cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude\n",
      "completely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation,\n",
      "you will have understood that these arrangements are of capital\n",
      "importance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they\n",
      "must appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or\n",
      "the shipwreck of my reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart\n",
      "sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility.\n",
      "Think of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a\n",
      "blackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware\n",
      "that, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away\n",
      "like a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your friend,\n",

      "“H.J.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“P.S.—I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my\n",
      "soul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter\n",
      "not come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dear\n",
      "Lanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the\n",
      "course of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It\n",
      "may then already be too late; and if that night passes without event,\n",
      "you will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane;\n",
      "but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound\n",
      "to do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less\n",
      "I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded\n",
      "could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose\n",
      "accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to\n",
      "Jekyll’s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by\n",
      "the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent\n",
      "at once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we\n",
      "were yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman’s surgical\n",
      "theatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll’s private\n",
      "cabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the\n",
      "lock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and\n",
      "have to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was\n",
      "near despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour’s\n",
      "work, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took\n",
      "out the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and\n",
      "returned with it to Cavendish Square.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly\n",
      "enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so\n",
      "that it was plain they were of Jekyll’s private manufacture; and when I\n",
      "opened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple\n",
      "crystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned\n",
      "my attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor,\n",
      "which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to\n",
      "contain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I\n",
      "could make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and\n",
      "contained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many\n",
      "years, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and\n",
      "quite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date,\n",
      "usually no more than a single word: “double” occurring perhaps six\n",
      "times in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the\n",
      "list and followed by several marks of exclamation, “total failure!!!”\n",
      "All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was\n",
      "definite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of\n",
      "experiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll’s investigations) to\n",
      "no end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these\n",
      "articles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life\n",
      "of my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why\n",
      "could he not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was\n",
      "this gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the\n",
      "more convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral\n",
      "disease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old\n",
      "revolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twelve o’clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded\n",
      "very gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a\n",
      "small man crouching against the pillars of the portico.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told me “yes” by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him\n",
      "enter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the\n",
      "darkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing\n",
      "with his bull’s eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor\n",
      "started and made greater haste.\n",
      "\n",
      "These particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed\n",
      "him into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready\n",
      "on my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I\n",
      "had never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as\n",
      "I have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his\n",
      "face, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and\n",
      "great apparent debility of constitution, and—last but not least—with\n",
      "the odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore\n",
      "some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked\n",
      "sinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic,\n",
      "personal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the\n",
      "symptoms; but I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much\n",
      "deeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the\n",
      "principle of hatred.\n",

      "\n",
      "I was born in the year 18— to a large fortune, endowed besides with\n",
      "excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of\n",
      "the wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been\n",
      "supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished\n",
      "future. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient\n",
      "gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such\n",
      "as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my\n",
      "head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the\n",
      "public. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that\n",
      "when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take\n",
      "stock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already\n",
      "committed to a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have even\n",
      "blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high\n",
      "views that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost\n",
      "morbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my\n",
      "aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me\n",
      "what I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men,\n",
      "severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound\n",
      "man’s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and\n",
      "inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of\n",
      "religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though\n",
      "so profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides\n",
      "of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside\n",
      "restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of\n",
      "day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and\n",
      "suffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies,\n",
      "which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and\n",
      "shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my\n",
      "members. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the\n",
      "moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth,\n",
      "by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful\n",
      "shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because\n",
      "the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others\n",
      "will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard\n",
      "the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of\n",
      "multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part,\n",
      "from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in\n",
      "one direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person,\n",
      "that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man;\n",
      "I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my\n",
      "consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was\n",
      "only because I was radically both; and from an early date, even before\n",
      "the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most\n",
      "naked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with\n",
      "pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of\n",
      "these elements. If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate\n",
      "identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the\n",
      "unjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of\n",
      "his more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely\n",
      "on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his\n",
      "pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands\n",
      "of this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these\n",
      "incongruous faggots were thus bound together—that in the agonised womb\n",
      "of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling.\n",
      "How, then were they dissociated?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began\n",
      "to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to\n",
      "perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling\n",
      "immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body\n",
      "in which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to\n",
      "shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss\n",
      "the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter\n",
      "deeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I\n",
      "have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound\n",
      "for ever on man’s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it\n",
      "off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful\n",
      "pressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too\n",
      "evident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only\n",
      "recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain\n",
      "of the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by\n",
      "which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a\n",
      "second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me\n",
      "because they were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements\n",
      "in my soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice. I\n",
      "knew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled\n",
      "and shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of\n",
      "an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition,\n",
      "utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to\n",
      "change. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at\n",
      "last overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my\n",
      "tincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a\n",
      "large quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments,\n",
      "to be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I\n",
      "compounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the\n",
      "glass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of\n",
      "courage, drank off the potion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly\n",
      "nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour\n",
      "of birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I\n",
      "came to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something\n",
      "strange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its\n",
      "very novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in\n",
      "body; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of\n",
      "disordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a\n",
      "solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent\n",
      "freedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first breath of this new\n",
      "life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my\n",
      "original evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me\n",
      "like wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these\n",
      "sensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in\n",
      "stature.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside\n",
      "me as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of\n",
      "these transformations. The night however, was far gone into the\n",
      "morning—the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the\n",
      "conception of the day—the inmates of my house were locked in the most\n",
      "rigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope\n",
      "and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom. I\n",
      "crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I\n",
      "could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that\n",
      "their unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through\n",
      "the corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw\n",
      "for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but\n",
      "that which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature,\n",
      "to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust\n",
      "and less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in\n",
      "the course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of\n",
      "effort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much\n",
      "less exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde\n",
      "was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as\n",
      "good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly\n",
      "and plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still\n",
      "believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint\n",
      "of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in\n",
      "the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of\n",
      "welcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes\n",
      "it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and\n",
      "single, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto\n",
      "accustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have\n",
      "observed that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come\n",
      "near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as\n",
      "I take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are\n",
      "commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of\n",
      "mankind, was pure evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive\n",
      "experiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had\n",
      "lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a\n",
      "house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once\n",
      "more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of\n",
      "dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the\n",
      "stature and the face of Henry Jekyll.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my\n",
      "discovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while\n",
      "under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been\n",
      "otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth\n",
      "an angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action; it\n",
      "was neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the\n",
      "prisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that\n",
      "which stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my\n",
      "evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the\n",
      "occasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence,\n",
      "although I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was\n",
      "wholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that\n",
      "incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already\n",
      "learned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a\n",
      "life of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my\n",
      "pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well\n",
      "known and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this\n",
      "incoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this\n",
      "side that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to\n",
      "drink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to\n",
      "assume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the\n",
      "notion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my\n",
      "preparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished that\n",
      "house in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as\n",
      "a housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and\n",
      "unscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr.\n",
      "Hyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my\n",
      "house in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made\n",
      "myself a familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up that\n",
      "will to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in\n",
      "the person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without\n",
      "pecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I\n",
      "began to profit by the strange immunities of my position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own\n",
      "person and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did\n",
      "so for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eye\n",
      "with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a\n",
      "schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of\n",
      "liberty. But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was\n",
      "complete. Think of it—I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my\n",
      "laboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the\n",
      "draught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done,\n",
      "Edward Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and\n",
      "there in his stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his\n",
      "study, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry\n",
      "Jekyll.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have\n",
      "said, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands\n",
      "of Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I\n",
      "would come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind\n",
      "of wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out of\n",
      "my own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being\n",
      "inherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on\n",
      "self; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture\n",
      "to another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at times\n",
      "aghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from\n",
      "ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was\n",
      "Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse;\n",
      "he woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even\n",
      "make haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And\n",
      "thus his conscience slumbered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Into the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now I\n",
      "can scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I\n",
      "mean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which\n",
      "my chastisement approached. I met with one accident which, as it\n",
      "brought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of\n",
      "cruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I\n",
      "recognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and\n",
      "the child’s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my\n",
      "life; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward\n",
      "Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in\n",
      "the name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from\n",
      "the future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward\n",
      "Hyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied\n",
      "my double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for\n",
      "one of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next\n",
      "day in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked about\n",
      "me; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room\n",
      "in the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed\n",
      "curtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept\n",
      "insisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I\n",
      "seemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to\n",
      "sleep in the body of Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my\n",
      "psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this\n",
      "illusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a\n",
      "comfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my\n",
      "more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Henry\n",
      "Jekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size;\n",
      "it was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which I now saw,\n",
      "clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half\n",
      "shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor\n",
      "and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand of\n",
      "Edward Hyde.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the\n",
      "mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden\n",
      "and startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I\n",
      "rushed to the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was\n",
      "changed into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed\n",
      "Henry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained?\n",
      "I asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror—how was it to be\n",
      "remedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my\n",
      "drugs were in the cabinet—a long journey down two pairs of stairs,\n",
      "through the back passage, across the open court and through the\n",
      "anatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It\n",
      "might indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that,\n",
      "when I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And then\n",
      "with an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind\n",
      "that the servants were already used to the coming and going of my\n",
      "second self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of\n",
      "my own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared\n",
      "and drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange\n",
      "array; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape\n",
      "and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of\n",
      "breakfasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Small indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal\n",
      "of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the\n",
      "wall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to\n",
      "reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities\n",
      "of my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of\n",
      "projecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed\n",
      "to me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature,\n",
      "as though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous\n",
      "tide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much\n",
      "prolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown,\n",
      "the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward\n",
      "Hyde become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always\n",
      "equally displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed\n",
      "me; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double,\n",
      "and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these\n",
      "rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment.\n",
      "Now, however, and in the light of that morning’s accident, I was led to\n",
      "remark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw\n",
      "off the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly\n",
      "transferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to\n",
      "point to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better\n",
      "self, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had\n",
      "memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared\n",
      "between them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive\n",
      "apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the\n",
      "pleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll,\n",
      "or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in\n",
      "which he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father’s\n",
      "interest; Hyde had more than a son’s indifference. To cast in my lot\n",
      "with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly\n",
      "indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was\n",
      "to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a\n",
      "blow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear\n",
      "unequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for\n",
      "while Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde\n",
      "would be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my\n",
      "circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace\n",
      "as man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any\n",
      "tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with\n",
      "so vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was\n",
      "found wanting in the strength to keep to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by\n",
      "friends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to\n",
      "the liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses\n",
      "and secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. I\n",
      "made this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I\n",
      "neither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward\n",
      "Hyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I\n",
      "was true to my determination; for two months, I led a life of such\n",
      "severity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the\n",
      "compensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last to\n",
      "obliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began\n",
      "to grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and\n",
      "longings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour\n",
      "of moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the\n",
      "transforming draught.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his\n",
      "vice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that\n",
      "he runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I,\n",
      "long as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the\n",
      "complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which\n",
      "were the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I\n",
      "was punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was\n",
      "conscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more\n",
      "furious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that\n",
      "stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to\n",
      "the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God,\n",
      "no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so\n",
      "pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit\n",
      "than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had\n",
      "voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which\n",
      "even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness\n",
      "among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was\n",
      "to fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport of\n",
      "glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow;\n",
      "and it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was\n",
      "suddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a\n",
      "cold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit;\n",
      "and fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and\n",
      "trembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life\n",
      "screwed to the topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make\n",
      "assurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through\n",
      "the lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on\n",
      "my crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still\n",
      "hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger.\n",
      "Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he\n",
      "drank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not\n",
      "done tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of\n",
      "gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped\n",
      "hands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I\n",
      "saw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood,\n",
      "when I had walked with my father’s hand, and through the self-denying\n",
      "toils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same\n",
      "sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could have\n",
      "screamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the\n",
      "crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against\n",
      "me; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity\n",
      "stared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die\n",
      "away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct was\n",
      "solved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was\n",
      "now confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced\n",
      "to think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the\n",
      "restrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked\n",
      "the door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key\n",
      "under my heel!\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked,\n",
      "that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was\n",
      "a man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been a\n",
      "tragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have\n",
      "my better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the\n",
      "scaffold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an\n",
      "instant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with\n",
      "honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself\n",
      "how earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to\n",
      "relieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the\n",
      "days passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say\n",
      "that I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead\n",
      "that I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my\n",
      "duality of purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the\n",
      "lower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to\n",
      "growl for licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare\n",
      "idea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person\n",
      "that I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was\n",
      "as an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of\n",
      "temptation.\n",
      "\n",
      "There comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled\n",
      "at last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the\n",
      "balance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural,\n",
      "like a return to the old days before I had made my discovery. It was a\n",
      "fine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted,\n",
      "but cloudless overhead; and the Regent’s Park was full of winter\n",
      "chirrupings and sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench;\n",
      "the animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a\n",
      "little drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to\n",
      "begin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I\n",
      "smiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will\n",
      "with the lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that\n",
      "vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the\n",
      "most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then\n",
      "as in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in\n",
      "the temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a\n",
      "solution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung\n",
      "formlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was\n",
      "corded and hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde. A moment before I had\n",
      "been safe of all men’s respect, wealthy, beloved—the cloth laying for\n",
      "me in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of\n",
      "mankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows.\n",
      "\n",
      "My reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than\n",
      "once observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed\n",
      "sharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came\n",
      "about that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the\n",
      "importance of the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of my\n",
      "cabinet; how was I to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing\n",
      "my temples in my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I\n",
      "had closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would\n",
      "consign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and\n",
      "thought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing\n",
      "that I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into\n",
      "his presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor,\n",
      "prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague,\n",
      "Dr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that of my original character, one part\n",
      "remained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceived\n",
      "that kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up from\n",
      "end to end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a\n",
      "passing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which\n",
      "I chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical\n",
      "enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could\n",
      "not conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of\n",
      "devilish fury; and the smile withered from his face—happily for him—yet\n",
      "more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged\n",
      "him from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so\n",
      "black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they\n",
      "exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a\n",
      "private room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of\n",
      "his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung\n",
      "to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was\n",
      "astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his\n",
      "two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he\n",
      "might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with\n",
      "directions that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat all\n",
      "day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he\n",
      "dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before\n",
      "his eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the\n",
      "corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of\n",
      "the city. He, I say—I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing\n",
      "human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last,\n",
      "thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab\n",
      "and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object\n",
      "marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers,\n",
      "these two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walked\n",
      "fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the\n",
      "less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided\n",
      "him from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box\n",
      "of lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I came to myself at Lanyon’s, the horror of my old friend perhaps\n",
      "affected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in the\n",
      "sea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours. A\n",
      "change had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it\n",
      "was the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyon’s\n",
      "condemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came\n",
      "home to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration of\n",
      "the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the\n",
      "nightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morning\n",
      "shaken, weakened, but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thought\n",
      "of the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten\n",
      "the appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home,\n",
      "in my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape\n",
      "shone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of\n",
      "hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the\n",
      "chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those\n",
      "indescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the\n",
      "time to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging\n",
      "and freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion a\n",
      "double dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat\n",
      "looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be\n",
      "re-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a\n",
      "great effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation\n",
      "of the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all\n",
      "hours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory\n",
      "shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair,\n",
      "it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this\n",
      "continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now\n",
      "condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I\n",
      "became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever,\n",
      "languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one\n",
      "thought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the\n",
      "virtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition\n",
      "(for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the\n",
      "possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling\n",
      "with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to\n",
      "contain the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to have\n",
      "grown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that now\n",
      "divided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of\n",
      "vital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature\n",
      "that shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was\n",
      "co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which\n",
      "in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought\n",
      "of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish\n",
      "but inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit\n",
      "seemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated\n",
      "and sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the\n",
      "offices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to\n",
      "him closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh,\n",
      "where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every\n",
      "hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against\n",
      "him, and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of\n",
